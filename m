Linus,

  Merge tag 'kvmarm-fixes-7.3-2' of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD (2026-10-01 13:13:57 -0400)

As mentioned in the previous PR, these are the patches that didn't make
it in time for rc5.  The most intrusive change is reverting a commit
from 7.3-rc1 that made struct kvm a bit too large, and fixing the same
issue otherwise.

There are again a lot of selftests lines; the sheer number of commits is
not small but I don't expect much more for 7.3 due to people travelling
to Plumbers next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------
ARM:

- Take a reference on the last IRQ loaded into an LR to prevent it
  from being freed while running the guest (Marc Zyngier)

- Ensure that the ITS MOVALL command only affects LPIs that were
  previously affined to the source redistributor (Marc Zyngier)

- Fix + test for honoring the host's trap configuration when running
  non-protected VMs while KVM is in protected mode (Fuad Tabba)

- Use the host stage-1 mapping granularity for VM_PFNMAP mappings at
  stage-2 (Mostafa Saleh)

x86:

Various bugfixes where the guest could do stupid things on purpose to
cause problems in the host:

- Failed VMRUNs can cause pending TLB flushes to be dropped, and in
  general some actions done through VMCB control fields have to be redone
  if VMRUN fails

- Toggling MSR interceptions or eVMCS execution controls can cause the
  host to use a stale MSR permission bitmap

- Bad page tables can cause a WARN.

Also fix issues in last week's pull request (my fault, for changing
email workflow and thus missing feedback sent to kvm@ but not LKML).

Generic:

- Take kvm_lock when creating vCPUs. For almost two decades everybody
  thought it was not done for some unspecified performance reasons, but
  in reality it was only done because kvm_lock was originally a spinlock.
  This is a better fix than 97d65b544f48 ("KVM: Check for duplicate vcpu_id
  as early as possible", from the 7.3 merge window), and does not waste
  2K per VM, hence its inclusion here.
