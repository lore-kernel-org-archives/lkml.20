I will go a bit further and recommend you to not let the LLM write any
text at all that is to be consumed by humans. If you don't feel
confident in your English, you can ask it to correct and improve your
text. Or write it in your mother language and ask it to translate.

Otherwise, if I need to make sense of what the LLM wrote (and they
will happily write a lot!), then I need to find big slots of time to
go over this kind of submissions, which is difficult for me now.
