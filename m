That is a bit too general + needs backing with specific spec references.
I'm not sure for instance if there are any guarantees around poison
lists for volatile as some errors detected by local ECC will be intermittent
anyway.

I may have forgotten it but I don't recall the CXL spec talking at all
about any long term tracking of errors in volatile memory across power
cycles.  There are interfaces to test memory to detect stuck bits but
I don't think there is any requirement to run them at device boot (and
we haven't enabled them in linux yet as on demand things).

The CXL region - may be hot added after boot.  Whilst I like that model,
on many existing systems the CXL subsystem is just identifying what
was already there.

At best a detection of an ECC error in local media is a hint that it
might not be cleared by a suitable full cache line write.

It might well be repaired just fine by a host write assuming the CPU
arch supports clearing poison that way. Ideally we'd poke it some to 
find out whether it is recoverable.

This bit needs shout more about as you just stopped region probe
on regions that previously probed (but would potentially return poison
on some memory).  I'd put a Note: Will stop regions probing if poison list
has overflowed. right at the top of this cover letter. 

I'm not necessarily against this. I need to think a bit more on the impacts.

Certainly an interesting patch set.
