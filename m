The keyring support didn't exist in my version of the dm-inlinecrypt
patch.  It seems to have been requested by Milan here:
https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel/682506ea-c9c2-458b-8123-8d78fc53cc7f@gmail.com/
then added by Linlin.

From what I understand, the point of the keyring support in
dm-{crypt,inlinecrypt,integrity} is:

- To support "trusted" keys.  But that is not what was actually
  implemented in dm-inlinecrypt.

- To avoid having the key be readable with STATUSTYPE_TABLE.  But that
  is not what was actually implemented in dm-inlinecrypt.  Keyrings are
  also unnecesary to solve that problem.

- To cause security bugs such as https://lwn.net/Articles/1090568/ .
  Since otherwise things aren't exciting enough, I guess.

Not sure what I'm missing.

But if you really do want to support all four key types in all three of
these targets anyway though, then sure, the code might as well be
shared since it would otherwise be the same code in each.
