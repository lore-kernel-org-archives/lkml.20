I think it still matters.

If there is a feature that is virtualized by the TDX module itself, but KVM doesn't
support it for non-TDX VMs, I think it should be allowed.

These features can't be added to the allow list because neither TDX module nor
KVM do the virtualization for them.

I think we can confirm with the TDX module team. If it will never show up on TDX
capable CPUs, then this is similar to PREFETCHWT1. 

But I am not sure we want new fixed-0 bits.

In the ISE (319433-062, table 1-6), it says:
  PBE:
  Pending Break Enable. The processor supports the use of the FERR#/PBE# pin
  when the processor is in the stop-clock state (STPCLK# is asserted) to signal
  the processor that an interrupt is pending and that the processor should
  return to normal operation to handle the interrupt. Bit 10 (PBE enable) in the
  IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR enables this capability.

TDX module doesn't allow IA32_MISC_ENABLE[10] to be 1 is since it's reserved
TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE is set, so my understanding was the CPUID bit should be 0. 

It seems bit 10 is phased out in IA32_MISC_ENABLE on modern processors like SPR
and EMR, since the bit 10 is reserved in "IA-32 Architectural MSRs" table. But
somehow, CPUID still reports PBE as supported.

I don't know why the CPUID is disconnected with the MSR.
But this bit is present on the host, I think we can add it to the allowlist.

That's the reason I explained in the commit message why other bits should not be
added to the allow list because if they are used, since they are can't be properly
virtualized, there should have been issues already before this patch series.

As I mentioned above, if there is a feature that is virtualized by the TDX module itself,
but KVM doesn't support it for non-TDX VMs, it should be allowed. Although I don't have
a concrete example. I think we still need to mention #VE reduction to some degree, but
let me see how to simplify the description.
