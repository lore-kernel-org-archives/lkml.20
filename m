I have decided to send v11, with the fix as patch 4, ahead of the accountin=
g
patch. Your two reasons are better than mine, so I have dropped the plan to=
=20
send it afterwards.

It is not gated on anything, so it does change behaviour for the other
five SDIO parts: the padding they send is zeroed now, and a transmit can
fail with -ENOMEM if the skb has to be reallocated. That is called out in
the Scope section rather than buried in the changelog.

One consequence worth flagging. The back-pressure patch stopped retrying
-ENOMEM in v10, because with no padding in the series nothing could
return it. It is reachable again now, so the retry is back. Without it a
stopped access category has nothing left to kick it. That patch is
therefore code identical to what you acked in v9; only its comments
differ, so I have carried your Acked-by.

Done. rtw_sdio_write_port() works out the transfer address and the
aligned size and passes both down, and the padding stays there too, so it
runs once for both paths and outside the credit mutex.

I kept the separate length in the RTL8723BS path, though, and I think it
is needed. It is not the transfer size, it feeds the page accounting:
rtw_sdio_check_free_txpg() and DIV_ROUND_UP(txsize, page_size), with a
128 byte page. The chip charges pages by the frame length rather than by
the padded transfer, which is what the vendor driver does, and the two
differ just above a block boundary:

  frame   pages by length   pages by padded size
   513          5                   8
  1025          9                  12

So using the aligned size there would charge up to three pages per frame
that the chip never took. There is a comment on the line now saying why.

Yes, with pad_size declared at the top, computed unconditionally, and teste=
d
with if (pad_size > 0).

Both are in v11, so yes.
