Ok. I get this in principle. Does this reflect a realistic workload for
inodes?

According to the current code, flushing inodes are those that have
landed in the AIL since or were otherwise not flushed (i.e. pinned,
locked) during a previous cluster flush, where the cluster was delwri
queued but has not yet submitted.

The only use of this value is as input to the 90% stuck heuristic. For
inodes, this strikes me as rare enough to wonder why we track this at
all..?

Wouldn't that mean we'd only process 1k items per pass, rather than
creating a delwri queue limit? It also seems to me this could lead to
situations we've already discussed like spinning around on the same
subset of items if they happen to land in the same LSN (unless we do the
cursor thing).

I'd have expected intent to be documented in the commit log.

Hm.. not sure about that. I played around with this a bit last week. I
couldn't exactly reproduce what is reported here, but if I run this sort
of workload on a slightly older kernel with preempt=none, I could
definitely reproduce observable multi-second (~3-5s) stalls where the
target system would appear locked up completely. Tracing shows that the
delwri queue can easily grow to ~250k+ buffers and the xfsaild task can
spin in short intervals.

I could corroborate this by reducing the watchdog threshold to a few
seconds and trigger softlockup warnings/stack traces that way, but
obviously this is a little different from a 20+ second lockup using
system defaults.

IIRC this behavior went away with the lazy preempt mode, so perhaps that
is a mitigating factor here. It would be good to know whether these
settings are relevant to the original reproducer or not.

I get that, but we can easily separate iop_push() overhead from the
question of flushing inode accounting.

That sounds reasonable, but perhaps non-trivial due to locking.

So all in all we have a situation where there's an unknown soft lockup
issue, a potential bug in iteration logic, an unclear requirement for
more complicated cursor management, and from my perspective a lack of
documentation on design intent (so we're reverse engineering it
piecemeal).

I still think the right approach here may be to rework the original
optimization in a way that retains prior iteration behavior, and then
revisit whatever algorithmic changes that were intended here in followon
patches with more clear documentation. I don't need to know what the
precise issue being reported here is to reason that there's probably
more complexity to this change than originally anticipated. All this is
saying is that it can't hurt to take a more careful approach. 

I also think this makes life easier for stable kernels where it might
take longer for more conservative users to run into the sort of problems
reported here (particularly with older preemption behavior).

This is just my .02. I cooked up a patch for reference:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20261008123141.358649-1-bfoster@redhat.com/

I forgot to label it RFC, but this is mainly for posterity. I'm
operating under the assumption this is NAK'd, so it is untested unless
there's indication we want to do something with it.
