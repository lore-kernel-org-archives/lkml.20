I don't think that's necessarily it.

Yes, it does remain disabled, but then (for example) why allow
set_rekey_offload() to go through - it's clearly not necessary.

But again, what are you actually trying to achieve?

If you want big A-MSDUs, then you need hardware crypto, which you allow
now, which would seem to _completely_ defeat the purpose of FIPS here
(to protect data, if you read it charitably vs. just saying it's for
paper-pushing).

OTOH, why does IGTK matter so much to you? That particular key has no
relation to data protection, so arguably *that* could still be
offloaded. But you're doing it all precisely the other way around.

Hence - again - my request for you spelling out what you're actually
trying to achieve, rather than throwing random code at me.

Well, it does work without MFP, so fundamentally the firmware can pass
data without having keys?

That's not the point - the point is that there are different
dependencies and you didn't think about _why_ something is disabled. Not
all of this is all related to MFP.

But again, the way you did that doesn't make any sense.

Which is the opposite of what you actually did.

I really do think it starts with spelling out what you (or your
customers) actually want, and what trade-offs wrt. FIPS you're willing
to accept.
