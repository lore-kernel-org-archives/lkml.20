I basically agree(d) with Jie here when I commented on v3:
"I think cppc_set_perf() needs some prep first before using it on reset values.
We assume that reset value may be Autonomous Mode on, right? So we must never
write MIN>MAX and vice versa. I think we may just have to read and write
the 'otherwise-offending' value first on reset."
So I wanted to have this (as prep work) within cppc_set_perf() not in cppc-cpufreq,
