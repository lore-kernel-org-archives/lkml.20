Hi! I'm one of the first people who pressed this issue while tracking
down the POSIX model for how side effects are supposed to work with
respect to EINTR and how that relates to thread cancellation, and how
glibc was getting all this stuff wrong, back around 2011-2012.

I don't think there is serious concern about userspace regressions
making this change. It would not be changing the meaning of any
existing result code or adding a new error condition applications need
to be aware of (like the EINPROGRESS mess).

But I'm also not sure how helpful the change would be. It's already
possible to patch this up in userspace, and as you noted, we already
do that in musl and so does Bionic. So the main practical effect of
this change would be just forcing the right behavior on glibc systems
even when glibc doesn't want to fix it. Maybe that's a good idea? I'm
not sure. I think it would be best to have everyone on the same page
that this should be fixed, with both glibc fixing it so it's right on
old-kernel/new-glibc, and the kernel fixing it so it's right on
new-kernel/old-glibc. That would also avoid hard feelings from a
unilateral action perceived as dictatorial.
