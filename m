An operator who wants a host to run more sandboxes needs to see how many
slots the slot pool has and what was donated to it, and to grow it.

Report the pool size, donations and limits in sysfs under slot_pool/ on
the misc device.

Writes to the limit allow an admin to increase the pool size. Pools are
increase only. To reduce the pool donation, you need to unload the driver.

+		Read-only. One value each, describing the memory the driver

+		descriptors itself asks for no donation and reports max as 0,
+		and then the remaining files describe nothing:
+
+		max
+			highest number of slots the device lets the pool hold,
+			as the device reports it. It reads 0 in three cases
+			that it does not tell apart: the device asks for no
+			donation, the device publishes no vendor capability so
+			the register was never read, or the driver turned down
+			the donation geometry the device reported. Only the
+			last of those names itself, in a dev_dbg() carrying
+			the size and alignment that were refused
+
+		granularity
+			size in bytes of one donation to the record pool, or 0
+			where the driver turned the geometry the device reported
+			down
+
+		base_size
+			size in bytes the device asks for as its base donation
+
+		base_donated
+			1 where the base donation was made, 0 where it was not.
+			The pool takes one base donation and no more
+
+		gran_donated
+			how many donations of granularity bytes were made to the
+			record pool. Probe makes one and a write to limit makes
+			the rest
+
+		A donation is drawn from the CMA area of the node the driver
+		asks first and, where that area cannot serve it, from the CMA
+		area of each other node that has memory in turn. It fails when
+		none of them can serve it. Comparing base_size and granularity
+		against base_donated and gran_donated says whether a larger
+		reservation would have changed the outcome.
+
+		These files change while the device is bound, because a write
+		to limit donates. A read takes the enclaves list mutex, which
+		is the mutex a donation and the release of the whole pool take,
+		so a read sees the pool between donations rather than part way
+		through one, and it can wait for a donation, an enclave or a
+		write to limit to finish. -ENODEV says the driver has no device
+		to describe.

+Description:
+		How many enclaves the device can hold on the memory it has
+		now, and the file to write to give it more.
+
+		The device counts each of its two pools in slots and an
+		enclave needs one in both, one for the record the device keeps
+		of it and one for the memory it runs on, so a read reports
+		whichever pool carries fewer. That is the number of enclaves
+		that can exist at once. It does not count the enclaves that
+		already do, so no difference between this file and max or
+		in_use is a count of the enclaves still to be had; whether one
+		can be had is what asking for it answers.
+
+		Writing a number that is no larger than max and no smaller
+		than the number read donates memory to whichever pool carries
+		fewer, one donation at a time, until both carry that many.
+		Writing the number already read donates nothing and succeeds.
+
+		A write that fails part-way neither reverts nor completes: the
+		driver cannot take a slot pool donation the device accepted
+		back one run at a time, so the pool stays at whatever size it
+		reached, and reading the file back reports that size. Each
+		individual donation is all-or-nothing, so a failed write never
+		leaves a run half given: what it leaves is fewer slots than
+		were asked for. The write returns the error the donation
+		failed with, and retrying carries on from where it stopped
+		rather than starting again.
+
+		A write can be refused with:
+
+		-EINVAL
+			the number is larger than max, or is not a number
+
+		-ERANGE
+			the number does not fit
+
+		-EOPNOTSUPP
+			the number is smaller than the number read, or the
+			device takes no donation. The device is never told to
+			give a slot's worth of memory back, so the pools do not
+			shrink
+
+		-ENOSPC
+			the device took a donation into each pool that was
+			behind and raised neither, or it reports a pool is at
+			its ceiling, so no further donation can raise the
+			number
+
+		-ENOMEM
+			no node's CMA area could serve a run to donate
+
+		-ENODEV
+			the driver has no device to describe
+
+		-EAGAIN
+			the device kept asking for a donation to be sent again
+
+		-ETIMEDOUT
+			the device did not answer a donation. It may hold the
+			memory that donation offered
+
+		-EINTR
+			a fatal signal arrived while donated memory was being
+			cleared
+
+		The device may answer a donation with any of its own errors,
+		and a write passes that through as well.
+
+		A read asks the device rather than reading a register, so it
+		can fail for the same reasons a write can. Both a read and a
+		write take the enclaves list mutex, and a write holds it for
+		every donation it makes, so no enclave can be created or
+		released while one is growing the pool, and a read waits for
+		it to finish.

+		the driver sends the device no further command.
+
+		in_use is not a capacity. Nothing here or in max or limit can
