Not really, I don't see the point TBH.

It is, and I'll expose why we need to get out of this deprecated API
as soon as possible, we are seriously keeping the ability to provide
support for advanced panel features which are implemented in vendor
kernels.

The API was ok when DSI was added and we didn't have generalized atomic
modesetting, why would you not want panels to embrace atomic ?

I don't understand, please elaborate.
