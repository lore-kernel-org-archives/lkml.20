So it seems that the expander-attached scenario was not tested for that 
comment mentioned.

You need to test directly-attached and expander-attached config for any 
relevant patchset.

Otherwise we have this scenario that alternate configs are continually 
broken.

Then that would be a separate change.

So then could the RPM resume calls be moved higher up, like at the 
smp_execute_task_sg() callsite? Would that work?

The check which you initially proposed for testing SAS_HA_RESUMING looks 
racy.
