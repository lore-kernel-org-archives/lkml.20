That was the starting point, but working on it I realized it was very
tricky. So I tried instead copying the relevant bridge/panel.c code into
drm_panel.c, but with more suitable function names, and the result is way
cleaner.

This changed the steps, but not the end result: remove
drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() and bridge/panel.c entirely.

Maybe, but as above, my plan has changed a bit.

My opinion is that for this tricky task we should focus more on the end
result (embed a bridge into every panel, remove
drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() and bridge/panel.c) than on finding the most
optimal path to get there. So I'm aiming at a path that is
build-bisectable, clean and understandable.

What do you think about this principle?

I'm sending a RFC v2 soon, so we can discuss on a specific proposal.

Luca
