Thanks for taking a look.  You questions are helpful for
providing the context of why this series was proposed.

By default, tasks are grouped by process and that make sense in many cases.
But sometimes the users have information about task characteristics that th=
ey wish to group
tasks in other ways.=20

In our discussions with Vern Hao from Tencent, they have multiple processes
in their workload, where some tasks in a process is responsible for
database access, some for encryption, and some dealing with disk access.
Those tasks across processes with similar function share more data than
tasks in a process for their applications. =20

Another scenario is grouping processes with shared memory together.

> But what tools do user space have today to make effective decisions?

As in the example above, this is for users who know about their workload
characteristics and wish to group their tasks in other way than the default
process grouping.

Also if people identify via perf c2c that tasks =20

No changes is required on application. An admin or a separate daemon
can use prctl to group tasks together by sepcifying the pids pair of tasks
to be grouped. Please see the PR_SCHED_CACHE_SHARE_FROM operation in
patch 7 of the documentation.

Yes.

I think there is no strong case to support that tasks sharing
data necessarily belong in a cgroup. Using cgroup wouldn't cover all the us=
e cases
we want. With the proposed prctl based interface in this series,
the administrator can easily group the processes in a cgroup together
if that makes sense. We also would rather not disturb the cgroup
interface unnecessarily.
