Hi Marc,

A gentle ping on this question. I am preparing v2 with the other review
comments addressed.

I would like to better understand the completion requirement so that I
can address this correctly in v2. In particular, could you clarify what
an outstanding IPI request could race with, and which component must
have observed the request before gic_ipi_send_mask() returns?

Any clarification would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kohei
