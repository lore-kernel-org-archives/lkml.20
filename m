I actually don't think that's something we should work around here.

Christian, what is your opinion on this?

IMO most people should not do id-mapped mounts from host range anyway
(they should shift a base rootfs to a high range, then do idmapped
mounts from there),

I still think it would be easier to reason about, long term, if we
could get away with storing the cap_eff of the process which creates
the user namespace, and check (ns-targeted) the capabilities of any task
trying to setns to it against that.
