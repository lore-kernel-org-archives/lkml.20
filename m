Yes, the naming is awkward.

The problem is that collapse_ is the prefix of everything in the
interface, so it cannot double as the verb: collapse_pmd() says what the
function is about, not what it does, and collapse_scanned_pmd() has no
verb at all.

Each name needs one after the prefix, hence scan and run. I don't
particularly like it, but it seems better than scan and scanned, no?

collapse_single_pmd() itself goes away in the next patch. You asked
there why; I will answer there.

The lock is held over the scan now, but it is taken fewer times. The
current code drops mmap_lock before the file scan, before it knows if
there is anything to collapse. Most scans find nothing, and each of them
pays the cost of unlock and relock for nothing.

Dropping the lock only after a scan found work mirrors the anonymous
side, with the same batching shape.

> What do you mean with "and only reads"?

That it no longer calls collapse_file(). The scan looks at the page
cache and says whether there is work; collapse_file() is the run's job.

I will drop the wording. It does not help.

It is also wrong, so I will rewrite it.

Before this patch collapse_single_pmd() set lock_dropped for every file
table, refused or not, and collapse_scan_mm_slot() bailed out on it.

The mm slot stays, so the next call comes back to the same mm at the
saved address, but every file table cost an unlock, a trip through
khugepaged_do_scan(), a relock and a VMA lookup.

Now only a table that gets collapsed pays that.

Not in this series.

The engine I have on top of it gives both a job.

I will drop it from this series and add it with the engine. The shape
might change by the time the engine is posted.

The check at the top of collapse_scan_pmd() stays, open-coded: a scan
that found work on a file table holds a reference, and the next scan is
where one that was never run gets caught.
