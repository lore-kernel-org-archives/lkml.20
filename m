Does "client remains" imply that the client can also be a Completer in
other circumstances?  I'd like to use PCIe terms when possible since
we're talking about PCIe ACS controls.

s/requester/Requester/ since it's defined by PCIe spec.
s/completions/Completions/ similarly.
s/Request redirect/Request Redirect/ to match spec.

s/and Egress Control/and P2P Egress Control/ to match spec and RR and
CR mentions here.  The second "Egress Control" matches the "Request
Redirect" so I think that's fine.

Am I right in thinking that there may be several such points e.g., a
Request is routed back downstream by any Downstream Port where P2P
Request Redirect is not enabled?

I think this "paths diverge" needs some background when it's
introduced, e.g. something like this (fix or reword as necessary):

  If the Requester and Completer are below the same Root Port, the
  path taken by Requests depends on ACS settings of the Downstream
  Ports above the Requester.  If ACS P2P Request Redirect is enabled
  in all of them, the Request is routed upstream; otherwise it will be
  routed back downstream via the Downstream Port leading to the
  Completer.  The path of Completions likewise depends on ACS P2P
  Completion Redirect in the Downstream Ports above the Completer.

Similarly, I don't think "the divergence" is defined yet here.  I
*think* it means the lowest Switch or Root Port shared between
Requester and Completer.  That's the first point where a TLP could be
either routed back downstream or upstream.

I think a TLP could also be routed back downstream if a higher Switch
Downstream Port or the Root Port had Request/Completion Redirect
cleared and lower Switch Downstream Ports had it set.
