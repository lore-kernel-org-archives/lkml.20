Yes, this is about USR_STACK. The CALLCHAIN doesn't suffer this issue since
perf already returns an IP chain and user space can directly map them to
the symbols without depending on any register or stack snapshots. :)

If no others insist to implement the precise USER_STACK sampling (what Ian
suggested), I would give up for sending the drafted precise USER_STACK
sampling patches. Per my understanding, refusing precise USER_STACK
sampling what current version does is a cleaner and simpler way.
Supporting precise USER_STACK sampling inevitably complexes the PEBS/IBS
handling.

BTW, currently perf tools already support the events creation fallback. As
long as user doesn't explicitly require precise USER_STACK sampling, the
USER_STACK sampling (--call-graph dwarf) would automatically fallback to
the PMI-based USER_STACK sampling after the initial precise USER_STACK
sampling try fails. So it won't really lead to the USER_STACK sampling fails. 

Thanks.
