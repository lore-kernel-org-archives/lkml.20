Please wait a bit until we discussed it for a bit.

That commit has to stay because it solves an ordering problem on some
architectures.

I do agree to having a conversation with Christian in my other mail,
where I wonder whether it would be better if a driver does the is-
signaled check, holding the lock.

These things are extremely complicated and cannot be rushed. We
discussed dma_fence synchronization for weeks this summer and concluded
that there is no easy solution at hands for some problems, notably
because of callbacks and legacy callbacks, and also because Christian
and I disagree on to what degree a fence should be locked.

Do you generate part of your mails with an LLM? It seems to be a huge
corpus for 11min of time between receiving and answer
