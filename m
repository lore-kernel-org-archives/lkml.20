Ok, then perhaps it's best just to enhance the CMT test to also check that the cache allocation
bitmap has some measureable effect rather than a new test. In the spirit of making the checks as
weak as possible we could just check that the measured llc_occupancy is lowest for the minimum
number of cache allocation bits set, higher when half the bits set and highest when all the bits are
set.

This brings us back to the initial subject of this patch. For MPAM we need a new implementation for
memflush() as cl_flush() doesn't have a direct equivalent on arm64. There is an smmcc based option
but the kernel support isn't upstream yet [1] and I don't know how widely it is supported in
firmware. As such, we need to use the writing of a buffer from a different control group. This
should be distinct from the default control group and have all cache portion bits set, as the CMT
test uses the inverse of the testing mask for the default group. The llc_occupancy of the testing
group can be used to check the group is clean enough, i.e. the memflush() had the desired effect.
All this does have the disadvantage of using the same features we are checking to to help with the
testing interface but there seems no easy way out of that while staying generic across even MPAM
platforms.

Thanks for sharing your experience on the testing robustness. I now see that being as permissive as
possible with our testing is the way to go.
