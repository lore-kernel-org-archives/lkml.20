All we need to find dependencies is a GSI number, the question though
is what are we really solving by creating a dependency (and where
that GSI number will be stored eventually so that the platform driver
at probe - when dependencies are cleared, can retrieve it).

I think that what we want is preventing a platform device to be created
(ie we don't create platform devices at static table init time anymore
but we let ACPI core do it at acpi_bus_attach(adev)/enumeration time ?)
till the dependencies are cleared but then, without a _CRS, where will
the consumer driver find the platform device resources ?

There are multiple facets in this issue and possibly some of them have
been already solved but I need to pull them together.

Yes it is getting messy. This RFC, with all its flaws, does not transparently
prevents enumeration but rather relies on -EPROBE_DEFER to sort out
dependencies - though it does so by adding more stuff into ACPI static fwnode
that to be honest I'd rather see gone.

That's a fair point - though then code will have to work with firmware
that does NOT explicitly require those devices in the namespace (ie: firmware
as it is specified _now_); it can turn out to be a mess even less
manageable than this discussion ;-)

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
