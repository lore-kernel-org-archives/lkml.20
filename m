Right, I forgot about that.  This deserves a comment in the code
somewhere.

I think we still need to be able to use DPC without EDR on non-ACPI
systems.

It would be nice if we could make native_dpc be the end result of AER,
EDR, and anything else that determines whether the OS can actually use
DPC.

Doing it on top of Lukas's series sounds good to me.
