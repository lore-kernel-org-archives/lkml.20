This is covered in a separate follow-up.

Feedback understood. I reviewed the wording and it sounded "fine" to me
but your comment makes sense; that this shouldn't mention that. I guess
I wanted to articulate the motivation or example for the feature,
but I can do that without mentioning Nix specifically.

This is a fall out of this design because the inodes grow after the
landlock rule has been applied based on what the sandbox does;

If we go forward with your other suggestion, this is moot anyways.

This dos follow the refer rule fwiw.

Thank you for taking the time to respond :)
