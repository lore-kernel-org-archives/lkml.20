Hello, Waiman.

The following is a Claude-generated review.

The isolated -> root failure came from b1034a690129 ("cgroup/cpuset:
Ensure domain isolated CPUs stay in root or isolated partition"). Maybe
add a Fixes: tag for it too?

The reproducer below is a local partition and the fix covers that case
too. The CPUs weren't given back to the parent, which is what leaves them
in subpartitions_cpus and isolated_cpus in the example. Maybe describe
both? Also, "properly disable" -> "disabling".

After the update_prstate() change, every path that invalidates a remote
partition goes through remote_partition_disable(), so the other
reset_partition_data() callers never see the flag set. If one did,
clearing only the flag would leave its CPUs in subpartitions_cpus and turn
the WARN_ON_ONCE() in partition_xcpus_del() into a silent leak. Maybe drop
this part?

"a x86" -> "an x86", "commands was" -> "commands were".

If a root -> isolated switch fails isolated_cpus_can_update() under an
isolated parent, partcmd_disable hands the CPUs back to the parent and
partition_xcpus_del() adds them to isolated_cpus, which is the state the
check just rejected. Switching to member ends up in the same place, so
this may be fine as is.

The early goto out paths never need the disable. Maybe put this block
before out: instead?

Also, update_cpumasks_hier() below gets force only when switching to
member, to update effective_xcpus. Now that the failure path disables the
partition too, should it pass disable_partition?

Separately, a partition invalidated with PERR_HKEEPING can become valid
again through partcmd_update without newmask (hotplug, or
update_cpumasks_hier() from an ancestor), which doesn't check
housekeeping. A failed member -> root enable has the same problem, so it
isn't from this patch.

Thanks.
