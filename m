I really don't think they are.  You've proposed one set of rules (as
code) - although I don't think they quite make sense.  I've proposed
another.  Other variants are possible.

I really dislike this idea.  It means we effectively have at least two
variants of every version which strikes me as pretty confusing.

With my proposal it won't stop in this case, but it will downgrade the
dtb to version 2.0, denying the kernel the use of any 3.0 features.

I can see why that's undesirable, but allowing modifications without
stripping unknown tags requires some very careful consideration.  In
fact I don't think it's possible without adding more bits to the
structured tag definition to indicate what changes will invalidate the
tag.

For example, take a tag indicating that part of a property represents
a phandle (I believe you'll need something like this for addons).
In order to rely on this tag the consumer which needs it will
generally need to know that *every* phandle is marked with such a tag.
So, suppose vZZZ requires this tag be present for every phandle.

A bootloader which only supports vYYY, not vZZZ _must_ downgrade if it
modifies or adds any properties, because it could break the vZZZ
constraint that every phandle must be tagger.

Some other tags might be safer, they're always optional and can be
safely stripped from a modified property.  But if the bootloader
doesn't know the specific tag, the only way it could know this is if
we encode it into the structured tag itself.

Right, but it also has to handle the case of adding a new property,
because it can't know if v<future> might require certain future tags.

They're really not.  You've proposed a set, but I don't think they're
adequate for some very forseeable cases.

As I said, I really don't like that semantic.  To be clear, I'm not
against adding a new version field, I just think the semantics
proposed for last_comp_version_w are not very helpful.

A version which says, if you don't understand this, you must downgrade
the whole dtb (stripping all unknown tags) would be better.  Although
then there's a secondary question of what should the downgraded
version be.

So, this will only be useful if it's common to add new tags which are
_not_ mandatory.  I'm not convinced that will be the case, since most
previous version revisions have been about advertising that the tree
*must* include certain information that was previously not available.
