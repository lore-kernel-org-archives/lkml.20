Oh yeah, it's definitely crazy and deeply an RFC.

That one was different, because these are normal threads, not kthreads.
They are created similarly to if you did pthread_create() in userspace,
this is what io-wq workers are already. So it's mostly as safe as io-wq
already is, by design, which is why the PF_IO_WORKER work happened and
why kthreads haven't been used since back in the early 5.x days.

So I don't think there's too much to worry about on the security front,
it's mostly a "this will confuse the application" kind of thing because
something has been missed. And yes that is no good either, but it's not
a security concern. That's VERY different from the kthread case, where
if you missed some kind of personality, then congrats you're now running
with fully elevated privileges.

I think that would be a tough sell, mostly because of how many locking
primitives we have and how widely they are used, and how difficult (or
impossible) it is to introduce error paths for code that previously had
none. That alone would make it a non-starter for me. Let alone is that
it'd be a continual whack-a-mole kind of work, it'll never be fully
done.

I think you'll find it'll be a lot MORE complicated than my approach!
Backing out error handling is going to be impossible in some cases,
think file systems for example. How would those cases be handled?
