THANK YOU!!! I'm getting kind of fed up with save/restore ordering
issues, as I am sure you are as well. :)

I wonder if Vanadium (Google's VMM) or QEMU 100% abide by the
restrictions listed here. A statement in the changelog confirming that
QEMU abides by these constraints would put me at ease.

Some suggestions/questions below.

This assumes the presence pre-copy live migration; this is not
necessarily the case. I think something more general should be
written, like:

This paragraph kind of confuses me because it's saying that this
ordering should be explicit, but the explanation why requires
userspace to do something odd: restore zero into
MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL *after* restoring other state into the vCPU.
(This is strange, right?) Maybe there should just be a paragraph about
generally avoiding resetting/zeroing some vCPU state after restoring
some other non-trivial vCPU state.

Then I *think* this paragraph/constraint can be removed. Does
MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL need to be restored first for any other
reason?

The grammar here seems a little broken; reading more carefully leaves
me more confused (might just be me).

Putting my QEMU/Vanadium hat on, I'm struggling to interpret this
constraint. What exactly does this constraint mean for how the code
must be written?

I'm also kind of confused why this constraint is written after the one
that is to be done last (KVM_SET_CLOCK).
