The clk_summary debugfs entries would be a good place to compare as
well.

Just some friendly advice: If you keep churning out AI code as quick as
you can generate it, then your stuff will end up at the very bottom of
the review queue. There's a long backlog of other changes that need to
be reviewed.

I'm not saying that you need to go review patches, but that goes a
really long way to building goodwill in the community. Maybe if you post
a large series like this go help review 2 or 3 patch sets that's in the
backlog from other people.

But seriously, the main ask from me is to please slow down before you
post new patches. Provide some more details about how this was tested on
real hardware.
