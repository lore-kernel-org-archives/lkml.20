Hi,

I have started to review and compare with our (old) pwm x1600 driver
which is based on some vendor driver. It appears to somehow support
DMA.

Here I have a first question about the naming scheme. It does not seem =
to be common
to have pwm-[vendor]-chip.c

The only exceptions I can see are pwm-bcm-*-c, pwm-intel-lgm.c, =
pwm-renesas-tpu.c.

Since there is already pwm-jz4740.c without vendor-infix, I'd suggest to =
simply use
pwm-x1600.c unless the pwm maintainers disagree.

More to come after trying to test...

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
