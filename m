I wouldn't just categorize the rest of the patches as mere cleanups. They are
indeed fixing an obvious race between PCI core and the driver doing ASPM dance
at the same time. But for sure, even after these patches, one can trigger the
same race between sysfs 'config' and the driver/PCI core, but that's more of an
user trying to perform an action to trigger a race vs race happening within the
kernel without user intervention (which is too bad).

I'd really like to see a way forward for these patches, even with a new API and
not let them fall through the cracks.
