Ok I've looked deeper to remove the is_local field. It should be doable.

complete_references(), probably renamed to fixup_references(), will still be
needed and called from build_dt_info(). Indeed, all refs need to point to a
valid string (path or label).

The idea removing is_local is to have the transitional state where ref can be NULL.
(REF_PHANDLE created from FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE where no ref are available but just
the phandle value).

Those NULL ref, identifying a local phandle, will be updated by fixup_references()
called from build_dt_info().

I plan also to remove the is_local field from export symbols structure. Indeed, the
exact same problematic exist with export symbol and related to this 'is_local' topic
REF_PHANDLE markers and export symbols have no reason to be handled in a different
way.

I plan to introduce an new function:
    bool ref_is_local(struct dt_info *dti, const char *ref)
in order to determine if a given reference is local or not.

As you already stated, this will be needed to emit the correct tag in the output dtb.

This function will walk the tree, no way to avoid that with a 'is_local' flag.

Ok, I will merge and extract libfdt related parts to a specific patch.

Ok on my side, I will remove the detail.
