Leon, please see *** below.

Not quite; the priv->revoked flag tracks temporary periods of
inaccessibility.  An example is VFIO resetting a function; the BAR
mappings as seen by the CPU and DMABUFs made from the BARs are all made
inaccessible before the reset, and made accessible again after the reset.

I feel the (existing) VFIO function reset sequenece is a counterexample,
as the resource isn't being reclaimed/repurposed but users are "held
off" for a period of time across the reset.  (It's then the same
resource that a later access can touch.)

> But when you have some IOCTL or sysfs or whatever to disable a DMA-buf permanently I would call that revoke.

I see where you're coming from now, thanks.

If we were to just call VFIO's "permanently inacessible" state _revoked_
and "temporarily inaccessible" _reclaimed_, then it doesn't help clarity
unfortunately.  Those words are ~synonymous and don't convey permanent
vs momentary.

***

Leon, would you please explain this comment #5?  Were you suggesting
that (even ignoring this patch!) you want to rename priv->revoked to
priv->reclaimed?  If so, why?  (For context, this patch's state =
TEMP_REVOKED is identical to the existing revoked = true.)

In short:  TEMP_${X} vs PERM_${X} most clearly highlights the
meaning/behaviour of the current + new state, regardless of whether
X=REVOKED or X=RECLAIMED.  Although I prefer to use the exisitng
"revoked" I'm not wed to it, but mixing both "reclaimed" & "revoked"
makes the distinction (and semantics, expectations of what can happen
next) much less clear.

> I'm still not 100% sure what a temporary revoke should be. If you have some IOCTL/sysfs/whatever to temporary say to importers "You can't use that resource" then that most likely won't fly.

This patch only provides an ioctl action to "make this inacessible
forever".  There is no direct userspace manipulation to/from the
temporarily-inacessible state, nor need for that.

The only things that lead to a temporary revoke (as a side effect) are
the preexisting VFIO reset ioctls etc.

State is an enum, but this isn't a complex FSM, just an extra "sticky"
state.  And to labour the point, the new temp/perm distinction is only
about VFIO's internal tracking of why it revoked the buffer using the
existing mechanisms (meaning, whether it permits un-revoke); it does not
change the importer.

Yep, quite.

Thanks,


Matt

PS: I should've rebased (eyeballed master and didn't spot the tiny
conflict), so no Sashiko review on v6; I want to resolve this for a v7 soon.
