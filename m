In which case, it is either stuck (and so will backoff) or needs to
continue iterating until it reaches the target or finds something to
submit. In the latter case, we want that search to happen as quickly
as possible to keep disk utilisation up and free up space in the log
for modifications that are blocked waiting for log space.

Pushing items that are already in FLUSHING state and then sleeping
for long periods on 'excessive flushing' heuristics does not acheive
this.

The original design was simply to provide efficient processing and
IO submission of log items without external interruption. i.e there
are no external reasons for things like backoffs existing; they
exist only for efficient management of the AIL contents and IO
submission in isolation from the rest of the filesystem.

The patch is definitely wrong. Whether changing the accounting is
needed is unknown, because we don't have any confirmation of what
the actual problem encountered is yet.

That means we lose the 'this inode cluster is being actively
modified' signal from the feedback loop. That makes it behave
differently to buffer items, and so now we have confused and
unbalanced signals being fed to the backoff control decision again.

Yup, and so will likley have thousands to tens of thousands of inode
items per checkpoint LSN in the AIL.

We did, but it didn't make progress like you describe because the LSN
would not change very often between iterations because of the sheer
number of items per LSN in the AIL.

That is, we can have tens of thousands of inodes on the same LSN in
the AIL. A CIL checkpoint on a large log is closed off at ~32MB in
size, and an inode core takes up about 300 bytes in the journal. If
we are logging nothing but inode cores (e.g. 'chown -R <somedir>'
over millions of files) then a single checkpoint can contain up to
~100,000 inode log items. These are all inserted into the AIL at the
same LSN.  Hence it is very common for there to be tens of thousands
of inode in the FLUSHING state on the same LSN in the AIL.

This means that the updating the LSN when we hit lots of flushing
inodes doesn't actually move the LSN for the next loop forwards.
We start the next loop at the same LSN in this case, and the only
reason we didn't tend to process the same flushing items a second
time is the backoff allows IO completion to remove the items from
the AIL.

IOWs, any algorithm that requires the LSN to change per iteration to
avoid reprocessing overhead is going to be highly inefficient.  The
backoffs are what allowed the contents at each LSN to change per
iteration in the old code by allowing IO to complete, but the new
code uses LI_FLUSHING instead of backoffs to acheive the same
purpose. The new code has much lower per-iteration latencies and
higher IO submission rates in these situations, which leads to
substantially better modification rates across the entire
filesystem....

Not a side effect. That was the -intention- of the patch; to be able
to submit more IO, faster, and using less CPU per item that needs
to be processes.

The old code was subject to that, too.

Which is just fine.

The historical method of handling these sort of "kernel thread has
lots of work to do" cases was to sprinkle cond_resched() through the
code. We've been told not to do that for several years now, and we
also have proper kernel thread preemption now. That means
long-running kernel processing tasks do not need to care about how
long they hold the CPU for as the scheduler can preempt and
reschedule them elsewhere if needed.

IOWs, we just don't care if there is so much work to do that the AIL
just keeps running flat out without backing off. If there's more
work to do, just keep running. It'll either run out of work or block
somewhere eventually, until then it should just keep churning
through the work as fast and efficiency as it can.

No, there was no 'task scheduling' signal to begin with. The
original backoffs were purely a mechanism to allow IO to complete
and remove flushing items from the AIL because there was no other
way to efficiently skip them.

The LI_FLUSHING mechanism allowed those items to be efficiently
skipped and ignored by the control loop, so the backoff to manage
the same 'don't reprocess flushing items on the current push lsn'
problem became unnecessary. i.e. there was no 'task management'
consideration in the backoffs at all.

The proposed fix doesn't restore the old behaviour. It just added
the accounting back in. However, the old behaviour relied on unbound
processing loops and backoffs to function correctly, neither of
which are restored in the proposed patch.

It might behave correctly when it triggers the flushed backoff, but
for sparse flushing items, they will likely get processed and
accounted over and over again until the flushing backoff threshold
is triggered and the aild goes to sleep to allow IO to complete and
remove flushing items from the AIL.

No. We need root cause analysis first. There is no general or
widepsread problem with the code as it stands - one bug report
without RCA does not equal "code is broken, must be reverted".

Besides, if the problem really is "we are walking too many
LI_FLUSHING items repeatedly because the LSN is not changing", then
I'm pretty sure there's a relatively straight forward fix for that.
i.e. we need fine grained tracking of the item we are up to across
loop iterations where the AIL lock is not held and the AIL can
change. We already do this within the processing loop itself...

Cheers,

Dave.
