Hi Boris,

Thanks for clarifying the direction.

My proposed approach is to use explicit vendor checks to make
init_amd_nbs() and amd_smn_init() AMD-only. Hygon node enumeration and
SMN setup would remain in Hygon code.

Sashiko's concern with v3 was that the AMD initializers were restricted
while Hygon call sites remained. However, as currently implemented, the
AMD NB and SMN paths are based on AMD topology assumptions and cannot
provide the Hygon node and SMN mappings.

I would first stop the affected Hygon call sites from entering those AMD
paths, and then make the two initializers AMD-only in the same series.
Later driver support would use the Hygon interfaces.

Would this ordering address the Sashiko concern?

Thanks & Br,

Lin
