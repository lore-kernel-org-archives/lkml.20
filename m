Why can't a real driver bind to those virtual functions?  Like is
happening in the rust apis?

How is hardware and software resources an issue here at all?  And you
can write to PCI config space from userspace today, no driver needed
anywhere at all, that's always been allowed.

Then just don't have a in-kernel driver for the device and all is good?
