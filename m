Yes, this is exactly what I am pointing out. Implementation aside, is that
the behavior we want?

TL;DR - No users, lets fix it before risc-v lands the userspace side IIUC

I can't find any libc's that support this for risc-v. It appears the glibc
patches were not merged and I commented on those patches just now
that the interface is wrong:
   - 
https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/8a5e21d0-0628-4910-9ad8-165c829e9680@foss.arm.com/

Additionally, stress-ng does it "generically", and it would be broken on 
a riscv system:
   - 
https://sources.debian.org/src/stress-ng/0.22.00-2/stress-prctl.c?hl=1144#L1144

This is a bug and never followed the convention to begin with. So risc-v is
non-compliant to the spec and this effectively prevents the a true 
unification
of a generic prctl interface. The behavior on riscv doesn't adhere to 
there own docs:

   - 
https://cdn.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arch/riscv/zicfiss.html#prctl-enabling

No, I mean when setting a locked bit via prctl 
and PR_SET_SHADOW_STACK_STATUS.
Currently, the error codes for changing a locked bit:
x86: EPERM
arm64: EBUSY (Which we discussed offline about changing to EPERM)
risc-v:

Agreed, it's more work, but I like it better.
