X-SES-Outgoing: 2026.11.10-54.240.6.53

On the Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1, the Wacom touchscreen (WCOM48CA) does
not work after resume from S3. Resume runs into I2C timeouts for 4 to 37
seconds and then fails:

  [37928.985861] i2c_designware i2c_designware.0: =
controller timed out
  [37928.986100] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-WCOM48CA:00: failed =
to change power setting.
  [37928.986340] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-WCOM48CA:00: PM:=
 dpm_run_callback(): acpi_subsys_resume returns -110

The controller has a power enable on GPP_B21 and an active-low reset on
GPP_B15. The firmware sets both up at boot, but ACPI does not describe
them: TPL0's _CRS only lists the I2C bus and the interrupt, and there is
no _PS0, _PS3 or _PR0. After S3 the firmware leaves both pads low, so
the controller stays unpowered and in reset. pinctrl-intel does not
restore them either, as it only saves pads that the kernel has requested.

Add a DMI quirk that provides the two GPIOs through a GPIO lookup table,
and power_up()/power_down() callbacks that sequence them like i2c-hid-of
does: power on, wait, release reset, wait. Holding the GPIOs from probe
makes pinctrl-intel save and restore the pads, and power_down() drives
them low first, so power_up() always starts from the powered-down state.

As far as I can tell from the BIOS image, the firmware waits about 9 ms
after enabling power before pulsing reset, so use 10 ms. Starting the
first transfer less than 3 ms after releasing reset makes SET_POWER fail
with -121, while 100 ms and 1000 ms both work; use 200 ms for some
margin, as I could not find a datasheet value.

As the touchscreen is not a=
 wakeup source, the controller is now also
powered down in s2idle and for =
hibernation.

Tested on a Latitude 7400 2-in-1 (BIOS 1.39.1) in S3, s2idle =
and
hibernation (pm_test=3Ddevices).

AI notice: I threw an AI coding agent=
 against it which wrote most of
the initial patch, I reviewed everything, =
directed the investigation
and ensured this is a minimal patch. The agent =
ran the initial tests
(via a KVM switch), and I tested it on the device =
myself as well.

Notes:
    This is my first kernel patch, so sorry in advance for anything I got
    wrong; I would be glad about any feedback.. I tried hard to match the
    required ettiquete.
   =20
    Background: the Latitude 7400 2-in-1 is =
a nice device, but it has
    issues with S3 sleep. As I did not have much =
time, I threw an AI coding
    agent on it and steered it in the directions=
 that looked promising,
    until it found out what goes wrong and how it =
could be fixed.
    I reviewed all of the code and tried to keep the patch =
minimal,
    while keeping it readable and oriented me on how similar cases=
 were
    handled before.
   =20
    - I looked at i2c-hid-dmi-quirks.c and=
 tried to follow its pattern (DMI
      match, then device name), but kept =
the table in i2c-hid-acpi.c, as
      only this driver uses it, and did not=
 add a bigger structure for a
      single device. My thought was that if =
more models need this, the
      delays could move into the DMI match data,=
 as i2c-hid-of-elan keeps
      them per compatible. I'm happy to rework it=
 if you would prefer it
      differently, e.g. in i2c-hid-dmi-quirks.c or =
drivers/platform/x86.
   =20
    - The GPIOs are only requested for the =
quirked device and with named
      con_ids, so as far as I understand, =
gpiolib-acpi will not fall back
      to _CRS and pick up the touchscreen's=
 GpioInt.
   =20
    - I did not add checks for the return values of the =
GPIO writes in
      power_up(), following i2c-hid-of; =
i2c_hid_core_resume() ignores the
      return value of power_up() anyway.
   =20
    - Only the Wacom WCOM48CA panel was tested. The DSDT can also =
describe
      other panels in the TPL0 node; this quirk does not cover =
them.
   =20
    - Test setup: Latitude 7400 2-in-1 (SKU 08E2, board 0HCNR3=
, Core
      i5-8365U, touch controller 056A:48CA), BIOS 1.39.1. S3 works =
with the
      BIOS "Sleep Mode" set to "Force S3" as well as "OS Automatic
      Selection". Kernel v7.2.14 with i2c-hid.ko and i2c-hid-acpi.ko =
rebuilt
      with this patch: 7 S3 and 5 s2idle cycles, hibernation =
freeze/restore
      (pm_test=3Ddevices) and a driver reload. After every =
resume the touch
      resume callback returned 0 in about 315 ms and the =
controller answered
      HID GET_REPORT; finger input worked after S3. =
Without the patch, one
      S3 cycle reproduced the failure. The patch =
builds cleanly on v7.4-rc2
      with W=3D1 and sparse.
   =20
    - I was not sure whether this is suitable for stable... (I think it is?=
),
      so I did not add a Cc: stable tag and would leave that to you.
