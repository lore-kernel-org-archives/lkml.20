I certainly do. Next thing I'm gonna do is write to them. Note however
that unless they give me permission I won't be able to tell you the
outcome of my conversation. Hopefully one good day a certain file
appears in linux-firmware :)

Well asusctl has a daemon and a CLI too. I don't think it's much useful on zenbooks
due to missing TDP but it is a quick way to change supported firmware attributes
and bind epp policies to power profiles in case you are interested.

If for some reason the kernel can't feed sensor data to wmi properties asusd is
the right place for doing that (albeit I don't like when userspace does things that
the kernel should be doing on its own).
