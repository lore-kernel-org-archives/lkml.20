That's entire sentence rewriting.  We could consider doing that, but maybe
that's better to be done via another patch.  Let's focus on simple grammar and
style in this patch.

How about simply 's/page out/pages out those/'?

Let's do such rewriting with another patch.

I concern if readers could confuse if the range is inclusive or exclusive.  I'd
prefer the current sentence.

Makes sense to me.  What do you think, Manuel?

I feel like that's out of the scope of this patch.

If both of you agree to my abovely suggested/agreed changes ('s/page out/ pages
out those/' and 's/records/charges/'), I will update this patch in damon/next
tree with those changes.
