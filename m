can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all channels are set up

This commit moves register_candev() from peak_usb_create_dev() into
peak_usb_probe(). The netdevs are now registered only after every channel
of the interface has been initialized. peak_usb_disconnect() unregisters
only the netdevs flagged with the new PCAN_USB_STATE_REGISTERED bit, and
PCAN-USB now logs a failed channel id read with dev_err().

[Severity: Low]
The comment says this also runs during probe, before the netdev is
registered. The helpers this function calls still log through
netdev_err(), though. Was the conversion meant to stop here?

pcan_usb_get_can_channel_id()->pcan_usb_wait_rsp() still does:

	if (err)
		netdev_err(dev->netdev,
			"waiting rsp f=0x%x n=0x%x failure: %d\n", f, n, err);

pcan_usb_send_cmd() does the same with "sending cmd ...". The same holds
for pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd() in pcan_usb_fd.c, and for
pcan_usb_pro_send_cmd(), pcan_usb_pro_wait_rsp() and
pcan_usb_pro_send_req() in pcan_usb_pro.c. All of them are reached from
dev_init(), dev_set_bus(dev, 0) and dev_get_can_channel_id() in
peak_usb_create_dev().

register_candev() now runs later, in peak_usb_probe(), so netdev->name
still holds the "can%d" template at this point. __netdev_printk() will
print these messages as "(unnamed net_device) (uninitialized)". On
PCAN-USB, a failed channel id read would now print an
"(unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): waiting rsp ..." line just before
the new dev_err() line.

Should those helpers be converted as well?

>  	else
>  		*can_ch_id = args[0];

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, not introduced by this patch, but can
args[0] be read here without ever being initialized?

args[] has no initializer. When the device is no longer connected,
pcan_usb_wait_rsp() returns 0 without filling it:

	/* usb device unregistered? */
	if (!test_bit(PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED, &dev->state))
		return 0;

peak_usb_disconnect() clears PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED through
peak_usb_stop_rx() before calling unregister_candev(), so the netdev is
still registered during that window. An ETHTOOL_GEEPROM request that lands
there would go through peak_usb_get_eeprom()->dev_get_can_channel_id().
It would copy the uninitialized stack byte to userspace and cache it in
dev->can_channel_id.

The probe-time call this patch keeps runs with CONNECTED set, so it is
not affected.

[Severity: Low]
peak_usb_disconnect() now also cleans up netdevs that were never
registered. The PCAN_USB_STATE_REGISTERED test only guards
unregister_candev(). The name is still copied and printed for every
sibling:

		strscpy(name, netdev->name, IFNAMSIZ);
		...
		dev_info(&intf->dev, "%s removed\n", name);

alloc_candev() leaves the "can%d" template in netdev->name until
register_netdevice() expands it. Will each unregistered channel then log
a literal "can%d removed"? That would happen when peak_usb_create_dev()
fails, or when register_candev() fails partway through the loop in
peak_usb_probe().

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does the bus-off command
sent on close ever reach the device on this path?

peak_usb_disconnect() starts with:

	/* stop RX on all channels before unregistering and freeing them */
	peak_usb_stop_rx(usb_get_intfdata(intf));

This clears PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED on every channel. For an opened
channel, unregister_candev() then calls peak_usb_ndo_stop(), which sends
dev_stop() and dev_set_bus(dev, 0).

Once CONNECTED is clear, pcan_usb_send_cmd(), pcan_usb_wait_rsp(),
pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd(), pcan_usb_pro_send_cmd() and
pcan_usb_pro_send_req() all return 0 without sending anything. Even so,
ndo_stop still sets dev->can.state = CAN_STATE_STOPPED.

The adapter can stay attached here: on a sysfs unbind, or on the probe
error path when a later register_candev() fails after an earlier sibling
was registered and opened. Wouldn't its CAN controller then stay bus-on
with no driver bound?

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue, but the hardware state set by dev_init()
does not seem to be undone on this path.

On PCAN-USB FD and Pro, channel 0's dev_init() (pcan_usb_fd_init() /
pcan_usb_pro_init()) sends drv_loaded(1) and sets the clock domain and
the LEDs. peak_usb_disconnect() only calls dev_free(), which frees memory
and sends no command.

The matching drv_loaded(0) and LED shutdown are in dev_exit()
(pcan_usb_fd_exit() / pcan_usb_pro_exit()). dev_exit() is only called
from peak_usb_do_device_exit() at module unload.

Is it intended that a failed probe leaves the adapter in its "driver
loaded" firmware state? With this patch, a register_candev() failure,
including for channel 0 on a single-channel adapter, also reaches this
teardown after the firmware has been initialized. A normal sysfs unbind
leaves the adapter in the same state.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but can this teardown lead to
a use-after-free? Neither this error path nor peak_usb_disconnect()
drains the asynchronous restart URBs or cancels the PCAN-USB
restart_timer before free_candev().

On PCAN-USB, the restart URB completion always arms the timer, whatever
the URB status:

static void pcan_usb_restart_pending(struct urb *urb)
{
	struct pcan_usb *pdev = urb->context;

	/* the PCAN-USB needs time to restart */
	mod_timer(&pdev->restart_timer,
			jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(PCAN_USB_STARTUP_TIMEOUT));
	...
}

Nothing in the driver calls timer_delete_sync() or timer_shutdown_sync()
on restart_timer. On unplug or unbind, the endpoint flush completes the
URB with -ESHUTDOWN, which arms the timer. peak_usb_disconnect() then
frees the netdev, and the timer_list lives in that netdev's private area.
Up to 10ms later, this would run on freed memory:

pcan_usb_restart()
  peak_usb_restart_complete(dev)
    netif_wake_queue(dev->netdev)

On Pro and FD, pcan_usb_pro_restart_async() and
pcan_usb_fd_restart_async() submit unanchored URBs with the channel
pointer as urb->context. On this probe error path the USB core has not
disabled the interface.

Suppose register_candev() fails for a later channel while an earlier,
registered and opened channel has a restart in flight. Could
pcan_usb_pro_restart_complete()->peak_usb_restart_complete(urb->context)
then run after free_candev()?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue in pcan_usb_pro.c and is not related to the
code changed here. Can pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg() copy past the end of
the record and past can_frame->data[]?

	can_frame->len = rx->len & 0x0f;
	...
		memcpy(can_frame->data, rx->data, can_frame->len);

The length comes from the device, ranges from 0 to 15, and is not checked
against CAN_MAX_DLEN or the payload size of the record type.
pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() only checks the fixed record size:

		if (rec_ptr + sizeof_rec > msg_end) {

RXMSG0 records (12 bytes, no payload) and RXMSG4 records (16 bytes) both
reach the same handler:

	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXMSG4] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 4,
	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXMSG0] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 8,

A broken or malicious adapter could send such a record with a large
length nibble. The memcpy would then read beyond the record:

- into stale bytes of the non-zeroed kmalloc() RX buffer allocated in
  peak_usb_start(), or
- past the end of that buffer, when the record sits at its end.

With len > 8 it would also write up to 7 bytes past can_frame->data[8].
Frames with len <= 8 that carry this data go to CAN_RAW readers through
netif_rx().
