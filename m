We are walking the window resources of an apriori known root bus here,
and pcibios_resource_to_bus() takes a bus, walks up to the root, iterates
over all window resources again to find the given resource, and then
applies the offset.

I agree it would be better to respect the layering here, but using
pcibios_resource_to_bus() is a bit of a kludge. Could we split it up
perhaps?

Sure. That would also change the polarity, but I think that's an
improvement actually.
