Subject: [PATCH v4 00/16] Microchip OTPC driver on SAM9X60 exposing UIDxR as additional nvmem device

Hei hei,

after sitting on my todo list since February, I rebased on top of
v7.4-rc1, addressed all review comments, and now this is v4 of the
series.  Motivation and changelog below:

On a custom sam9x60 based board we want to access a unique ID of the
SoC.  Microchip sam-ba has a command 'readuniqueid' which returns the
content of the OTPC Product UID x Registers in that case.

(On different boards with a SAMA5D2 sam-ba and we use the Serial Number
x Register for that purpose.  In the linux kernel those are exposed
through nvmem by the atmel soc driver.  Those registers are not present
in the SAM9X60 series, but only for SAMA5D2/SAMA5D4 AFAIK.  Neither of
those uses /sys/devices/socX for exposing the serial number.)

There is a driver for the OTPC of the SAMA7G5 and after comparing
register layouts it seems that one is almost identical to the one used
by SAM9X60.  Currently that driver has no support for the UIDx
registers, but I suppose it would be the right place to implement it,
because the registers are within the OTPC register address offsets.

When developing and testing it became clear the OTPC needs explicit
enabling of certain clocks in the otpc driver.  So the patch series
starts with some rework of clock bindings and clock drivers, along with
referencing that in SoC dtsi files.

The four patches for the otpc driver start with two patches with some
unrelated fixups for that driver.  It follows a patch dealing the
necessary clock enablement.  The last patch for the otpc driver adds an
additional nvmem device for the UIDx registers, fullfilling the initial
goal of mine.

Output of sam-ba:

    00000010

I tested the series at runtime only on SAM9X60, not on SAMA7G5 or the
other SoCs affected, because I only have sam9x60 hardware for testing.
If someone could test on SAM9X7, SAMA7G5, and SAMA7D65, that would be
highly appreciated.

Series is build time tested for sam9, sama5, and sama7.

Last question: Should the UID be added to the device entropy pool with
add_device_randomness() as done in the SAMA5D2 sfr driver?

For detailed patch changelog see each patch, general changelog below.

(series based on v7.4-rc1)

v4:
- "re-added" more indexes related to actual hardware to the split-up
  definitions in bindings, adapt other patches to this (Claudiu)
- dropped patch 5 ("clk: at91: sama7d65: Use highest PMC definition as
  max index"), that was a drive-by patch for sama7d65 which is not my
  department, and the discussion implied lots of extra work for a SoC
  not used here
- reword some commit messages (Claudiu)
- dropped patch 8 ("dt-bindings: nvmem: microchip-otpc: Add compatible
  for SAM9X60") and 12 ("nvmem: microchip-otpc: Add SAM9X60 support"),
  no need for a new compatible unless driver needs different behaviour,
  use sama7g5 compatible for sam9x60 as well, adapt other patches
  accordingly (Claudiu)

v3:
- Reordered patch series (thanks Claudiu)
- Collected review tags plus minor commit message fixes (e.g. tag order)
- Removed clock-names from dt bindings, led to confusion on review,
  and not used by the driver anyways (always enables all clocks)
- Removed redundant example from dt bindings docs
- Extended the per SoC splitup of the PMC definitions to the whole at91 family
- Add patch for a small after splitup fixup of the sama7d65 clock driver
- Add patch for removing old preprocessor definitions
- Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260120143759.904013-1-ada@thorsis.com/

v2:
- Removed patch adding bad OPTC conditions warnings on probe
- Removed patch adding more register definitions (the one register
  definition required was moved to the last patch adding the nvmem for
  UID registers)
- Added multiple new patches handling the dt-bindings issues
- Extend the possibility to enable the main rc oscillator to all at91
  SoCs with an OTPC
- Added patches to reference and enable the OTPC peripheral clock on all
  capable SoCs
- Reordered patches
- Reworded commit messages
- Squashed patches with dts changes for sam9x60
- Fixed bot warnings
- Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250210164506.495747-1-ada@thorsis.com/

v1:
- Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240821105943.230281-1-ada@thorsis.com/

(I sent an RFC patch on this topic earlier in 2024, you'll find the
link below as a reference to the discussion.  The patch itself was
trivial and not meant for applying as is anyways, so I decided to not
write a full changelog from RFC to v1.)
