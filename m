Thank you for keep working on this with patience.

Good eyes!  Yes, seems it was only mistakenly written in the way.  Please feel
free to send a separate patch or include it into the next version of this
patch, whatever better for you.

I think the clarification is better to be added to the 'temporal' quota tuner,
since this happens only when it is used.  Maybe the clarification could also be
shorter.  For example,

What do you think, Liew?
