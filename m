Useful perhaps to call out if this has been seen in real systems or
not. I agree with the analysis but would rather hope drivers are
well behaved in ensuring all traffic is done, adn this is hardeninging
/ handling of naught hardware activity (all good if so!)

What is the + indicating?  Seems where prod0 that isn't relevant here
would have been - that is a little confusing so maybe drop?

That name suggests this is doing the draining rather than waiting
for it to happen elsewhere.

Pet irritation. Prefer splitting the elements that assign and those
that don't onto seeprate lines.  Here that just means moving pending
up one line.

Applying a macro called Q_POS to a difference is a bit confusing to
me given the output isn't a position of anything. Maybe just needs
a wrapper Q_DIFF(q->llq, prod, cons)  Can use Q_POS underneath
but avoid that naming out here well away from the macro definitions.

Maybe pull defintion of prev and undrained in here so it is clear
they aren't state maintained across iternations.

Given you don't use undrained again (maybe in later patches, in which
case ignore me.)
		if (Q_DIFF(&q->llq, prod, cons) == 0)
perhaps.  This one entirely up to you as maybe the named local does
help with readability a little.

I don't like 'unrealisitic' based defenses (even though I agree it is pretty
unlikely).  Is there a way to bound this?  Maybe future systems will
be much quicker.

Why WARN_ON here then a dev_warn_ratelimited() below?

fsleep() perhaps then we don't get to argue why that slack.
