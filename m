Overall, This is plausible for me with some small question.

Just a thought, but how are we planning to retrieve
the NV index for EK certificate?

As far as I know, TPM NV storage doesn't support labeling.

Should I assume that the NV index would be specified as part of the
challenge to retrieve the certificate from TPM NV storage?

JFYI, this would be a CCEL log like tdx:

For me, It seems fine.
