I don't know how SError works, but this sounds like a pretty big open
issue with respect to RAS.  I don't think we want a kernel panic
because a device failed to respond to a config or MMIO access, e.g.,
if a card or Thunderbolt cable got unplugged.

The commit log implies that the patch blocks both config and MMIO
accesses: "software may access MMIO or config space ... Use ECAM
blocker to drop these accesses."  If the ECAM blocker only affects
config accesses, we need to reword that description.

If this patch doesn't affect MMIO accesses, I assume they will still
fail and lead to SError?  I'm a little dubious about the utility of
this because I assume most runtime driver accesses will be to MMIO
space, not config space.

I assume this is also racy: any config access that happens in the
window between the link going down and the ECAM blocker being enabled
will still fail and result in SError, right?

For config or MMIO reads targeting a device below a switch, if the
link to the device is down, I think the switch will return an
Unsupported Request completion without data (PCIe r7.0, sec 2.3.1.1).

The PCIe spec doesn't prescribe whether RC synthesizes data to
complete the read, but x86 RCs typically synthesize ~0 data.  I guess
some arm64 RCs assert SError instead of completing the read.

IIUC, if the link from the RP goes down, we'll take the LDn interrupt,
enable ECAM blocker, and future config reads would return ~0.  But if
a link below a switch goes down, there's no LDn interrupt and it
sounds like future config reads would result in a UR Cpl and SError.
