I=20understand. I will modify this patch to also add myself as R
for rtw88 and I will send updated version in v4 of this series.

I=20would prefer to be listed as a reviewer because as such I am
CC'd on each patch for rtw88. I'm not subscribed to wireless
mailing list as linux.dev service provided by linux foundation
states that we shouldn't subscribe to high volume lists.
