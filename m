The expectation is that no new fixed-1 bits will be added after the initial TDX
basic support. A new fixed-1 bit means the x86 architecture itself leaves the
TDX module no choice, so the TDX module will not add one unless some very
unusual future architectural change forces it to (and it's hard to see such a
design passing the design review in practice). If that ever does happen, it
would imply a significant architectural change, and we can figure out how to
handle it then.

Yes, it would work for migration cases.

Yes. This is exactly the backward compatibility issue for option 2.
Though I am not sure how important it is when losing a feature that is being
deprecated.

Do you mean on the old platforms, the according TDX module versions add opt-in
knobs to allow the "effective 1 -> directly configurable" change?

It probably needs some TDX specific handling, since the TDX module clobbers the
MSRs (setting them to either their INIT values or some default values), whereas
in the VMX case the guest values are left.

One consideration is performance.

- When The TDX module clobbers an MSR, there are 1 RDMSR + 2 WRMSR
  TDX WRMSR to restore guest value
  ---
  TDX RDMSR to save guest value
  TDX WRMSR to set to default value
- When The TDX module save/restore an MSR, there are 2 RDMSR + 2 WRMSR
  TDX RDMSR to save host value
  TDX WRMSR to restore guest value
  ---
  TDX RDMSR to save guest value
  TDX WRMSR to restore host value

In most cases where the TDX module chooses to clobber an MSR rather than restore
the host value, that MSR isn't consumed in ring 0, so the Linux kernel/KVM
simply restores the value before returning to userspace.

That means for most TD entry/exit paths there is one extra MSR read per MSR.

Previously in the PUCK meeting, we proposed that the TDX module preserve host
state by default for any new feature, and provide an interface for the host VMM
to opt in to "don't preserve" as an optimization. That proposal wasn't pursued,
since Sean suggested letting KVM do the CPUID validation for TDX instead.

Yes.

If FRED support lands in KVM for non-TDX VMs before this filtering/invalidation
is in place, adding FRED to the hardcoded denylist would work as a temporary
solution.

But that only holds for a well-behaved userspace VMM. QEMU, for example, only
enables features supported by both KVM and TDX, so if FRED isn't supported in
KVM for non-TDX VMs, QEMU won't enable it for TDX either.

A malicious userspace VMM, however, can set a feature regardless of KVM's
reported CPU capabilities, and could still cause trouble.

> Do we want it? Where would it get plugged in?

So if the approach in this series is taken, I think we still need such an opt-in
interface to tell the TDX module that the VMM is now filtering the CPUID bits so
that the TDX module knows that it's safe to report new host state clobbering
features.
