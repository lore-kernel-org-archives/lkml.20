Not sure, this contradicts each other. As I read it:

 - Write (status) register will always clear a WEL, the only open
   question is, does it also clear it if the protection bit in the
   FSR is set
 - Write disable won't clear the WEL if the protection bit in the
   FSR is set.

> But the truth is that the second unlock I did came without an error.

Which might indicate that a write status will clear the WEL anyway.
But then it might also be interesting to see if the PROT bit in FSR
is still set. IOW, if a new write enable is sent, a write disable
might fail even if there was no actual error.

Ok.

But the unlocking does not return EIO anymore when it's executed
successfully?

Yes. But also please verify the our guesses about the root cause of
this and what's the actual behavior of the write disable.
