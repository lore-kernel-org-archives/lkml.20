Ok, those are to be update to use a switch on tag but that's not big deal
 - fdt_check_node_offset_()
 - fdt_check_prop_offset_()
 - fdt_add_subnode_namelen()
 - fdt_finish()

Some others like nextprop_() or fdt_next_node() mix a while loop and a
switch/case. Some rework to be planned.

Well, today there is no "unknown" tags and existing callers works correctly.

Unknown tags are reported as FDT_NOP. It should be ok with existing callers.
They should handle FDT_NOP.

I don't want to add the versioning extra complexity in this context.
I am sure we can find a solution for this "all tags vs only known tags"
topic without versioning involved.

I would say yes but maybe I am wrong.

Skipping unknown tag is a low level feature.
I think fdt_next_tag() can handle this low level feature.

Upper layer using fdt_next_tag() should not handle this tag skipping the
general case and let fdt_next_tag() do this job.

Got the feeling that we are going to add complexity at upper layer to handle
a feature that should be handled at low level.

Well as we did for "offset 0 vs real root node offset", I think the best way
to known if it's bad or not is to try.
 
I will not have time this week to propose something and I have a training
next week.

If you're ok for a try, I will do it but not as quickly as I did for the
"offset 0 vs real root node offset" topic.

We are on the same page.
