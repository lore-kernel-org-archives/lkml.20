The actual driver is also bound, but at a later stage. I'm not sure what you
mean by “Rust APIs.”

According to the PCI spec—or, at least, the common interpretation of it—
newly created VFs should have equivalent hardware-resource partitions.
For most hardware resources, this is not an issue. One resource, however,
is critical to partition correctly: the number of MSI-X vectors per VF.
These vectors are backed by physical resources and directly affect
performance and utilization.

In a correctly configured system, the number of MSI-X vectors should
match the number of CPUs assigned to the VM. More vectors can leave
hardware underutilized; fewer can degrade performance.

The workflow for cloud operators is therefore:

1. Create a large number of VFs, but do not assign them yet.
2. Lease a VM to a user and determine how many CPUs they requested.
3. Repartition the internal MSI-X table allocation.
4. Assign the VF to the user.
5. Check how many MSI-X vectors remain available, then return to step 2.

The MSI-X table size is read near the beginning of driver initialization
and cannot be changed afterward.

So, no—you cannot change those PCI values without breaking the driver
and OS that are already running.

In addition to Jason's comments, the PF and VF share the same driver because
they are nearly identical, apart from a few differences in PCI
configuration space.

Please revert the series ASAP, you are clearly breaking existing deployments.
