I think there is something more needed to understand the problem.

The source of my concern was originally the traversal of the entire
list of child directory dentries in the notification code to set a
flag that depended on a parent dentry setting.

From the information I got (which is usually somewhat limited) it
was obvious the number of dentries was very large and there was a
large proportion of negative dentries. The obvious assumption is
that the implicated list traversal was causing the lock held too
long messages due to the number of entries. There was evidence in
the vmcore analysis the proportion negative dentries in the child
list was unusually large too, similar to the proportion of system
negative dentries.

I should be able to grab the vmcore again and get more details if
that would be useful to you.

While the unbounded accumulation of negative dentries has often
appeared to be a problem, and the case Miklos and I were looking
at implicated that, I also thought that traversing the entire list
of children to set a flag based on the parent dentry was not good
design. After mentioning that Jan replied (wrt. using the parent
dentry instead of setting a flag on the child) saying dget_parent()
was high overhead. I let that go even though I didn't understand
why dget_parent() was needed. Using dget_parent() would only ensure
the parent dentry didn't disappear from under you (it wouldn't
protect you from deletes or renames) but dentries are rcu managed
so an rcu_read_lock() should do the same.

So what am I saying, I'm saying that I think the list traversal
that was causing this particular problem can be eliminated. But
that doesn't do anything to come up with a mechanism to better
manage negative dentry accumulation which I think would be better
done as part of the dentry life cycle than as a shrink operation.
That's just my preference.

But if there are Terabytes of memory it often doesn't become in
short supply.

This might be able to be better managed by updated or possibly
expanded settings based more on number of (negative) dentries
than memory size.

TBH I haven't looked at that aspect.

>=20

Mostly only in so much as it not happening.

Problems with shrinker operation don't come up as much as they
used to so I don't see that as a problem myself.

Not sure about that.

One thing a negative dentry needs to do is maintain it's
linkages in directories and such so it can be located on
lookup to effect caching benefit. So separate lists might
be cumbersome and possibly problematic.

Or maybe adding negative dentries to the end and positives to the
front might be simpler.

A ttl might be useful too, use it to discard stale entries as they
are encountered (although the discard policy would probably be
somewhat more involved taking into account positive vs. negatives
etc.).

This in line with my preference to mange these "on-the-go" so to
speak, not necessarily related to any functional parameter
improvement that might be possible.
