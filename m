can: peak_usb: reject records for unset channels in PCAN-USB Pro

With this patch, the PCAN-USB Pro decoders reject CAN message and status
records for a channel whose slot in usb_if->dev[] is NULL. The slot is
now published with smp_store_release() in pcan_usb_pro_init() and
cleared in pcan_usb_pro_free().

[Severity: Low]
Is -EINVAL the right return value here? pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() treats
any negative return from the record handlers as fatal for the whole
transfer:

pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() {
    ...
		case PCAN_USBPRO_RXRTR:
			err = pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg(usb_if, &pr->rx_msg);
			if (err < 0)
				goto fail;
			break;
    ...
fail:
	if (err)
		pcan_dump_mem("received msg",
			      urb->transfer_buffer, urb->actual_length);
}

Both channels share the PCAN_USBPRO_EP_MSGIN bulk-in endpoint, and their
records sit back to back in a single transfer. Suppose one channel 1
record arrives before pcan_usb_pro_init() has published dev[1]. Then
every later record in that transfer is dropped, including valid
channel 0 CAN frames, channel 0 RXSTATUS records, and the RXTS records
that feed usb_if->time_ref.

pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() also hex dumps each such transfer without rate
limiting. At this commit, peak_usb_read_bulk_callback() dumps it a
second time. A later patch in the series, "can: peak_usb: only dump
received bytes on decode error", rate limits that second dump. The
dump in pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() and the dropped records are still
there at the end of the series.

sizeof_rec has already been computed and bounds checked for this record.
Could the handler return 0, or the loop skip just this record? Only the
record for the unset channel would then be rejected, which is what the
commit message describes. The same question applies to the new check
in pcan_usb_pro_handle_error().

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. Since
this function now validates the channel from the device, should the
payload length be validated as well? Further down in
pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg():

	can_frame->len = rx->len & 0x0f;
	...
	} else {
		memcpy(can_frame->data, rx->data, can_frame->len);

The device sets can_frame->len to any value from 0 to 15. Nothing checks
it against CAN_MAX_DLEN or against the payload the record type actually
carries. pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() checks record bounds only against
the fixed size for each type:

	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXMSG0] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 8,
	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXRTR] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 8,

A device could end a transfer with a 12 byte RXMSG0 record carrying
len = 8 (or an RXRTR record with PCAN_USBPRO_RTR clear). That record
passes the rec_ptr + sizeof_rec > msg_end check. Can the memcpy() then
read 8 bytes past urb->actual_length?

If the record ends exactly at the end of the 1024 byte RX buffer
kmalloc()ed in peak_usb_start(), the read runs past the slab object.
With a shorter transfer, it reads stale bytes from the buffer, which is
not zeroed. In both cases those bytes reach CAN sockets through
netif_rx().

Lengths 9 to 15 also write up to 7 bytes past can_frame->data[].

Could the length be clamped to CAN_MAX_DLEN and checked against the
record size? This code is unchanged at the end of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
This is another pre-existing issue that this patch did not introduce.
pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() reads the type byte of the next record before
it checks that the record is inside the transfer:

	for (; rec_cnt > 0; rec_cnt--) {
		union pcan_usb_pro_rec *pr = (union pcan_usb_pro_rec *)rec_ptr;
		u16 sizeof_rec = pcan_usb_pro_sizeof_rec[pr->data_type];
		...
		if (rec_ptr + sizeof_rec > msg_end) {

rec_cnt comes from the device. Suppose it overstates the number of
records and the previous record ended exactly at msg_end. Then
pr->data_type reads transfer_buffer[actual_length]. When actual_length
equals PCAN_USBPRO_RX_BUFFER_SIZE, is that a 1 byte out-of-bounds read
of the RX buffer?

The value is only used as an index into pcan_usb_pro_sizeof_rec[], so
nothing is passed on. Would a rec_ptr >= msg_end check at the top of
the loop be enough? This is still present at the end of the series.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. Does
the new !dev check get reached at all while pdev->usb_if is still NULL?
At this commit, peak_usb_create_dev() calls register_candev() before
dev->adapter->dev_init():

	err = register_candev(netdev);
	...
	if (dev->adapter->dev_init) {
		err = dev->adapter->dev_init(dev);

So the channel can be opened before pcan_usb_pro_init() sets
pdev->usb_if. In that window, pcan_usb_pro_start() dereferences the NULL
pointer:

	if (pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count == 0) {

An RX completion that reaches pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() in that window
also gets usb_if == NULL from pcan_usb_pro_dev_if(). The record handlers
then dereference usb_if->dev[] or usb_if->cm_ignore_count before the
new check runs.

This looks fixed later in the series by "can: peak_usb: register the
netdev only once the channel is set up". That patch moves
register_candev() after dev_init() and dev_set_bus().

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. Can
this kfree() still race with channel 0's own RX URBs and with its
ndo_stop? At this commit, peak_usb_create_dev() does the following when
dev_set_bus() fails:

adap_dev_free:
	...
	peak_usb_stop_rx(dev->prev_siblings);

	if (dev->adapter->dev_free)
		dev->adapter->dev_free(dev);

lbl_unregister_candev:
	unregister_candev(netdev);

For channel 0, dev->prev_siblings is NULL, so no RX URBs are stopped.
There is no sibling yet either, so pcan_usb_pro_free() frees the shared
pcan_usb_pro_interface.

If channel 0 was opened after pcan_usb_pro_init(), its RX completions
still reach pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf(). That function reads
usb_if->dev[], time_ref and cm_ignore_count from the freed object.

unregister_candev() then calls ndo_stop, and pcan_usb_pro_stop() writes
to the freed memory:

	pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count--;

This also looks fixed later in the series by "can: peak_usb: register
the netdev only once the channel is set up". In that patch,
register_candev() comes after dev_set_bus(), and the adap_dev_free path
no longer calls unregister_candev().
