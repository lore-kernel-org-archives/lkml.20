My understanding is that this is the runtime available to a DL task and
the length of a DL period (after the accounted runtime is reset). The
left over runtime (of runtime is less than period) is either buffer
(idle) or SCHED_OTHER runtime.
This defines how much runtime a DL task gets from the system, correct?

That is my point. The rt_ runtime/ period is about DL properties and not
RT as in SCHED_FIFO/ RR as it once was. Both are set to one second as of
today and can not be changed with enabled CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED.

Could we please move it to /sys/kernel/sched/ and rename it as dl
something? Is there any reason to keep as-is? There is
	Documentation/scheduler/sched-deadline.rst
	Documentation/arch/arm64/asymmetric-32bit.rst

referring to it in DL context. There is "ftracetest" writing
unconditionally -1 as a workaround, see commit 57c4cfd4a2eef
("ftrace/selftests: workaround cgroup RT scheduling issues").

If the runtime/ period arguments are fine then we could keep
it and make them only apply for the DL period.

Two files have been repurposed and if your intention as to disable the
RT throttler then you will be surprised.

okay, then let me prepare a removal of this then.

Hmm. You may want to merge Qais's current master to get it compiled
again ;) But then nothing hooks it up, so I just replaced with with
trace_printk() just to see what happens and got:

Comparing the first and the second preemption point, it is different.
The first looks like a direct consequence of the fair_server and second
probably because of the left over budget. This reflects the
implementation and I understand if you don't want to expose this
directly as-is. There is also this where the N flag just vanishes:

I assume the bandwidth was replenished and then loop-time could remain
on the CPU. It would probably help if I would weld have dump some DL
details along=E2=80=A6
I'm not sure if it would be better to add some DL details along or
extend sched_switch with a scheduling reason.

There are also no trace events for DL tasks if they exceed their
requested runtime, right? I *think* there is a signal (or can be) sent
if the DL task runs for too long.=20
The sched_pelt* events didn't contain any bandwidth information as far
as I can tell (you just pointed me there as an example how those trace
points could be utilized I suppose).
