I think both are fine and I like this proposal.

Yeah, that's what I was worrying as well.

Fwiw, this brings me to another general idea of mine: I want to be able
to pin a "creds" light variant that doesn't pin all the unnecessary cred
cruft like keyrings that you really don't need in a lot of cases. Like a
core cred reference that does namespaces uids/gids, caps and ucount but
drops all the rest.

I think that this is an acceptable restriction. Mapping uid 0 to 0 and
dropping caps is borderline useless.
