I'm not angry with anybody, I'm saying the patch feels like a (fragile)
hack and the issue needs addressing more fundamentally, echoing David's
suggestion.

I also pointed out that when comments need to be extremely specific about
exactly why you're doing something, that usually means something is wrong.

To expand on that - the reason why is that clearly the logic you are
adjusting is assuming something.

You are violating that assumption, which is why the comment is there.

Generally that means the assumptions are wrong and something more
fundamental needs to be changed.
