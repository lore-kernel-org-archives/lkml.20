Ack. Will be fixed in v7.

I think this is a good idea. In general, the default should probably
either set intensities to max_(r|g|b) or brightness to max_brightness.
This would reduce the amount of writes necessary to see a result and I
agree that probably the brightness knob is most likely to be used by
userspace. Still, I'd like to have some more feedback, especially from
the maintainers before integrating this behavior in v7.

I could have a look at your branch, but I think it's better to wait for
this series to be merged before exploring more advanced features. I
can't guarantee that I will work on that actively, especially since I
don't have access to such hardware, but I'm curious to see what changes
you have applied to make it work with v4.
