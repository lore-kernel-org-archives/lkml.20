I'm not good at picking names, but yes, reusing a name in the same=20
kernel cycle using the same signature is asking for trouble.

There are (at least) these sources:

- quirks (disable only)
- hw has ASPM related problem at certain phase of operation
- sysfs
- lane margining (the proposed patch)

I don't think locks can really solve this well as the sources seem largely=
=20
independent from each other and are not necessarily short-lived periods=20
(one could perhaps say some cases occur early enough the other sources don'=
t=20
matter but there are still enough sources even with that considered so=20
that disable/enable pair could overlap, potentially leading to unwanted=20
enable of a state).

IIRC, L0p was also incompatible with ASPM states. But it could be HW is=20
fine with both being configure at the same point of time (I've not checked=
=20
the spec with that in mind).

A quirk would just makes pci_disable_link_state(pdev, PCIE_LINK_STATE_L1)=
=20
call (or whatever that ends up being called if a new name is selected),=20
which increases disabled counter for L1 state. As there's no pairing=20
enable, L1 cannot be enabled anymore by anything.

Only if the particular state disable counter is 0, the ASPM driver allows=
=20
enabling that state or the other states depending on that state.


Sysfs accessors need to keep an additional bit per state to not request=20
multiple disables/enables for a single state. The rest of the sources have=
=20
it naturally from their operation and pairing disable/enable calls.
