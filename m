I would rephrase the above as follows:

"Runtime power management (or runtime PM, sometimes also referred to
as RPM) allows individual I/O devices that are not in active use to be
put into low-power states, in which they may not be operational or
even accessible, and go back to the fully operational state as needed.
Power can be reduced this way without waiting for a transition into a
system-wide sleep state."

Regarding the above, I have reconsidered it with the conclusion that
it would be better to describe "active" and "suspended" first and
"enabled" and "disabled" subsequently, and maybe without going too
much into details yet.  Here's my version of it:

"There are some device-level concepts that need to be grasped in order
to understand runtime PM as a whole.

First of all, runtime PM tracks whether or not devices are in active
use, which generally means that they are accessible and operational,
and may be depended on by something (for example, other devices or
user space).  That is represented by the **active** meta-state of a
device from the runtime PM perspective.  The other persistent device
meta-state used by runtime PM, called **suspended**, represents a
promise that the given device will not be accessed.  This covers
devices in low-power states, but it also may include devices that are
not fully operational, or are regarded as such, for other reasons.
There are also two transient meta-states, **suspending** and
**resuming**, that represent transitions between **active** and
**suspended** often referred to as *runtime suspend* and *runtime
resume*, or just *suspend* and *resume*, respectively.  Every device
handled by runtime PM is in one of these four meta-states at any time
and the meta-state it is in is expected to reflect its actual physical
configuration (that is, for instance, if the device is not accessible,
it cannot be **active**).  The term "runtime PM state" used in what
follows refers to the meta-states described above.

Second, in order to track the runtime PM state and carry out
transitions between **active** and **suspended**, runtime PM needs to
be **enabled** for the given device.  If it is **disabled**, it
generally leaves the device alone.  This means in particular that the
runtime PM state of a device and its actual physical configuration may
get out of sync after disabling runtime PM for it.  Analogously, the
runtime PM state of a device may need to be explicitly adjusted to
reflect its current physical configuration before enabling runtime PM
for it.  Moreover, it is generally not recommended to leave devices in
the **active** meta-state after disabling runtime PM for them because
that may affect what can be done to their ancestors and suppliers
going forward.

More specifically, in addition to tracking the runtime PM state of
every device, runtime PM tracks dependencies between different
devices.  In fact, that dependency tracking mechanism is the main
reason for using runtime PM.  The idea is that in order for a device
to become **active**, all of the devices it depends on must also be
**active** and that is enforced by runtime PM.  Accordingly, an
attempt to resume a device causes all of the devices it depends on to
become **active** and remain **active** until the given device is
suspended.  In turn, an attempt to suspend a device may allow the
devices it depends on to also suspend unless they are additionally
depended on by something else.  While desirable so long as runtime PM
is **enabled**, this may become problematic when runtime PM is
**disabled** because the tracking of dependencies does not stop
automatically at that point and it may cause some devices to remain
**active** unnecessarily.

As a rule, runtime PM is **disabled** for all devices to start with,
but there are bus types that enable it for every device (for instance,
the PCI bus type does so).  Generally speaking, drivers are expected
to know which bus they belong to and so they should also know whether
or not runtime PM has been enabled for the devices handled by them
already.  In the cases in which runtime PM is not enabled by the bus
type, drivers are responsible for enabling it if they want to
participate in it.  The devices for which runtime PM has never been
enabled are black boxes from its point of view.

Finally, runtime PM may be **forbidden** even though it has been
enabled.  Doing so causes the given device to transition into the
**active** meta-state (unless it has been **active** already before)
and prevents it from being suspended.  In other words, a device with
forbidden runtime PM remains **active** at least until runtime PM is
**allowed** for it again.  This mechanism is not only available to
kernel code, but it may also be used by user space through the
``/sys/devices/.../power/control`` *sysfs* attribute of the given
device.  Namely, writing ``on`` to that attribute causes runtime PM to
be forbidden for it, and writing ``auto`` to that attribute causes
runtime PM to be allowed.  User space may use that attribute at any
time, so the ability to transition a device into the **suspended**
meta-state via runtime PM must not be relied on for correctness, among
other things."

I think that it provides all of the information needed to start with
without pulling too much stuff documented elsewhere.

If you agree with the above, I'll send my version as a separate patch.

The last part above looks fine to me.

Thanks!
