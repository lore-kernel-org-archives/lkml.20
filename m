Okay then, I will get a machine to figure the performance gains :)

Ah, so we can just ask the hypervisor in EL2 to enable that behavior in 
those cpus? I have dig deeper in code to get a better understanding on how 
that would work.

Would that make sense in pKVM as well?

Likewise, I am not opposed to make it work outside VHE as well, I just 
don't understand enough of nVHE/hVHE/pKVM yet, so I thought starting with 
VHE would be simpler.

Oh, sorry, that got confusing up there. Everything above (*) was my 
perception of why would not that work. Lines below (*) are a new idea on 
how we could use it in the last level hypervisor.

L1 considering that L1 is the last level hypervisor, right? So the example 
above the (*). 

If so, yeah it makes sense. Shadow S2 acs as a TLB so we don't have to 
walk all intermediate pagetables to figure out the translation every time 
we need to access it and the entry is not in the HW TLB.

Thanks for sharing this... thinking about the shadow S2 just became easier 
:)

Would relaxing here mean mark the shadow S2 PTE as RO?
I think you got what I meant on the idea below (*), but exemplified with 
the example above (*).

What I meant in the idea below the (*) is that the level (n-1) hypervisor 
could just flip the dirty-bit for it's level n guest (which is the last 
level  hypervisor), emulating a hardware that supports HAFDBS. That would 
avoid injecting the fault in the level n guest and just flip the bit 
directly from level (n-1) viewpoint. For that, only the Ln hypervisor 
should have HAFDBS enabled. (this idea does not depend on the 
underlying hardware actually supporting HAFDBS).

Does it make sense, then?

Humm, makes sense.
Would you like me to change the new one to kvm_has_nv() in the next 
version?

Thanks!
