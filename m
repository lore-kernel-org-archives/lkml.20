Hi Barry,

Thanks for the review and testing. Glad to see it worked for you.

Right there could be some similarities, and some differences, e.g. no
more lru_gen_in_fault hanlding here, or difference between anon /
file. BTW did you test the whole series or just this patch? This patch
have a few workaround as intermeidate step (e.g. the forced LRU lock
in folio_mark_access, which is a pure burden but have to stay until
very end of the series).

No problem; it means the same thing and looks better indeed. I think I
better change the return type to unsigned too, refs can never be
negative (gen could be though, as a reserved value).

Right, I wanted to introduce an idea of something called tailing gens
(e.g. 8 tailing gens when there are 64 gens in total, folios in
tailing gens are promoted on each access instead of multiple access,
this works really well for fine grained hotness detection, and avoids
over protection too). But for now this helper is just meant to tell
the caller if the folio is close to be evicted or not, checking
min_seq only could easily fall into a pitfall where the oldest gen is
very short.

Maybe lru_gen_at_expiry? Or lru_gen_at_salvage?

BTW the whole picture involves three kinds of gens:
{tailing/expiry/salvage} gens (promote by one gen on each one FD
access), frequency gens (promote by one gen on multiple FD access),
times gens (promote to latest gen on PTE access); We now only have
expiry gens and frequency gens, timed gens are extensions for the
workingset report or pghot design. e.g we have 64 gens, then 8 tailing
gens are expiry gens, 16 frequency gens, and 48 newest gens are timed
gens.

I mentioned this in the cover letter that the "climbing of the file
cache" will stop at 8 gens or 16 gens, this is the whole story, there
is a lot of context and plan so I trimed them off to focus on the FG
improvement first..

Not sure how? They seem to want the same thing: promote the folio.

We just checked if (old_gen =3D=3D max_gen), so this should be fine? I
mean overflow and the mod MAX_NR_GENS is also part of the sliding
window logic.

No problem; I can use a macro for that, as they mean the same thing.

Right the FG idea is to always retain the frequency counts, instead of
resetting them to 0, so folio_inc_lru_refs can promote FD accessed
folios much more proactively, when a folio reaches LRU_REFS_MAX it
will be promoted by one gen.

I did a in depth analyze of runtime distribution, with this, we can
see very hot folio being promoted from max_seq - 1 to max_seq, and
after aging, the hotness info is still kept and workingset stay stable
and accurate (it's like the global aging of traditional LFU, which is
obsoluted in upstream due to overhead despite having better accuracy,
but now it comes with almost zero cost).

Right that part is meant for aging the older folios and PID controller
though. LRU_REFS_WORKINGSET could means historical workingset, and
LRU_REFS_PROTECTED means folios being currently actively protected.

Also we are now giving the PID tiers a proper defination, tier 0 is
readahead / cold cache, tier 1 is folios used at least once, and
LRU_REFS_WORKINGSET is just the tier 1 fallback line, tier 2 is
LRU_REFS_PROTECTED which is the proactive promotion wokringset
/candidates, consistent with each other.

They are never cleared, only PID protection / eviction protection can
reset it to LRU_REFS_WORKINGSET, which is the idea of FG. And it
worked really well checking the zipf read data and especially for
multi tier DB benchmarks. Folios in

And actually for the current mainline MGLRU impelmentation,
PG_workinset is also never cleared and it will pin a folio at tier 3
causing over protection very easily, we will reset it to tier 1 here
and with a softer PID protection factor, it seems much better in real
workloads.
