Hi all,

This patch series adds support for ROG Ally handhelds in the HID driver for ASUS devices.

The changes include reinitialization of the device after exiting a sleep state,
gamepad configuration, vibration strength configuration, joysticks and triggers
range configuration, anti-deadzone configuration, response curve support,
force feedback support, gamepad mode support, turbo buttons support,
and button remapping support.

This driver is based on the original Luke's work, which was a great starting point
and I have reworked it to be upstreamable, while keeping the original functionality
intact and extending hid-asus to avoid regressions in functionality such as the
backlight control.

The ally support has been a surprisingly long task, spanning multiple years and
being used in Steam OS and well as other distributions for quite a while,
and I am happy to finally be submitting it.

At this time LEDs are not part of the patch series as I have work in progress to
unify LEDs handling across all ASUS devices, and I will submit that in a separate
patch series when the userspace interface will be ready to express capabilities
of these devices, but that will take some more time.

This driver is the culmination of a lot of work, from many different people,
and I want to thank Luke for his original work, as well as the many people that have
helped me test and provide feedback on the driver: Khamunetri, Jonathan, Derek,
Matthew and others that have helped during these years.

Best regards,
Denis Benato

With v5 I returned to the original manual management of memory and sysfs groups
as going devm did not play well with the general "plugin" architecture of the
ally portion of the driver and has caused more bugs than it solved: sashiko-bot
will have to make itself like hand-managed memory this time.

      interface removal by holding intf_mutex in the callers
