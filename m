Nope, the series fixes the bug and at the same time refactored to provide a
generalised solution. The driver_override as a concept exists for ages.

Nope, you are mistaken. As I explained the opaque 1.0.0 means nothing. The Git
SHA *is* the version of the code in question.

This is really orthogonal. But yes, keeping tools at the kernel source tree
makes sense for a better maintenance.
