Oh. Sorry not to catch your intend. not for only this series but for
the future usage, might it sound reasonable to add some mem alloca
fucntion for the test which could replace memalign() with above concept.

TBH, what user would generally care whether VMAs are merged or not?
Anyway, it would be better to add a helper with some PROT_NONE guards
to prevent unwanted VMA merges while testing.

Thanks :)

Agree. let me add one for this and replace memalign() used in
khugepagd and split_huge_page_test at first.

Okay. I'll drop the Reported-by: and change to Suggseted-by.

Thanks!
