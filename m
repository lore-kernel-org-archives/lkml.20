It's not just the MBIST workaround, but the officially recommended way
to powergate/ungate devices. Sure you could do whatever you want with
the reset outside of that sequence, but that doesn't mean it's a great
idea to do so. With runtime PM we can be reasonably sure that we're in
a known-good state at this point, which is the only reason we could get
away with doing this. That doesn't make it right, though.

Not necessarily. There might be devices that are truly only powered by
the core domain.

That only means it needs to be the top-level power domain, but it
doesn't imply that it is the only power domain involved to make any
particular device work.

Well, as evidenced by the issue you are observing, that expectation is
indeed very much baked in. DSI is part of the DIS partition, which might
be powered by the core partition, but the DIS partition also needs to
control a bunch of clocks and resets associated with devices that are
part of it. If you omit that DIS partition, then, yes, things are
expected to not work because the clocks and resets are not handled at
all.

Tegra20 and Tegra30 also seem to be wrong, to be honest. If they work,
then they probably only do by some happy accident. Evidently I wasn't
paying enough attention at the time and was convinced it was all correct
because of the Tested-bys.

I'm now wondering how much testing was actually done for these. Once the
display is turned off and back on (via framebuffer blank or DPMS), it
shouldn't come up properly again. Well, except maybe if the disable and
enable sequences are good enough to not need the reset in the middle.

Good, and that's the right thing in that case. Again, the power domains
were introduced to specifically address the (clock/)reset/powergate
sequence requirements. That's why the code uses the power domain code
paths in a mutually exclusive way with the resets. Either the power
domains take care of the entire power sequencing as recommended by the
TRM, or it doesn't (in which case we fall back to the more brittle
manual sequencing that we do).

So I stand by what I said earlier: if there's no power domain handling
the entirety of the DSI controller power sequencing, then the DT should
not have a power-domains property for the DSI controllers.
