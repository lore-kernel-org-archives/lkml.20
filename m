From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

Windows uses Virtualization Based Security for Credential Guard and
friends, and enables it by default in current releases. A guest with
VBS enabled runs its secure kernel in VTL1, a higher privilege level
which the hypervisor has to keep isolated from the normal kernel in
VTL0. KVM has no concept of that today, so Windows guests either lose
VBS or emulate it with nested virtualization, which is slower and
loses features.

There have been completely in-kernel implementations of VBS, which
did unnatural things all within a single kvm_vcpu (four APICs, etc.)

This is an attempt to build it more cleanly, more in userspace, based
on KVM planes (https://lwn.net/Articles/1087590/).

The behavioural reference was the in-kernel VSM implementation in the
Nitro Hypervisor, complete with its latest compatibility fixes since
it was last posted — largely turned into a bunch of kvm unit
tests. The result boots Windows Server 2016 through 2025 with
Credential Guard active, on both Intel and AMD hosts, with VTL1
protecting its memory from VTL0. With hibernate/resume tested, since
that part has always been extra fun.

For now I've structured the userspace part as a separable library
which can be pulled into QEMU or other VMMs. Partly because QEMU
doesn't want it when AI did the typing (but *might* tolerate it as an
external library), and partly because I think it might make sense to
have a more permissively licensed standard implementation for how
KVM-based VMMs implement VSM, and have some input from the Microsoft
side and some improved expectation that it'll *keep* working with
Windows and not keep breaking for every new release. But that's a
future conversation. For now I'm just preempting the question, "why
does it look like that?".

Pulled into my base tree on v7.1-rc7 (not reposted here):

 • KVM planes itself (Jörg's latest from June)
   https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20260608144252.351443-1-joro@8bytes.org/
   https://github.com/joergroedel/linux/tree/kvm-planes-v7.1
 • Paolo's memory protection attributes v3
   https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20260918135030.171564-1-pbonzini@redhat.com/
 • Melody Wang's SEV-SNP #HV doorbell / Restricted Injection series
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1777048608.git.huibo.wang@amd.com/
 • A few fixes to the above ride just above them in the git tree,
   each citing the report it addresses; not part of this posting

Generic fixes and features in KVM before we get to VSM itself:

 • Userspace opt-in (KVM_CAP_PLANES) and plane run-state ioctls;
   MP state, guest-debug, KVM_TRANSLATE, SETUP_MCE and a filtered
   KVM_ENABLE_CAP on plane vCPU fds; unwind of a failed
   KVM_CREATE_PLANE
 • Plane mechanics: per-plane request fan-out, kicking the twin
   that is actually running, XCR0 and TSC matching shared across
   twins, runtime CPUID per plane, APICv inhibited while planes
   are enabled (for now).
 • Per-plane memory attributes and overlays, and instruction state
   on the memory-fault exit, for the VMM to build intercept
   messages from
 • Fixes found along the way: KVM_TRANSLATE reporting a real
   write-access walk, SVM keeping TPR[3:0] across exits without a
   guest CR8 write

Finally we get to the actual Hyper-V VSM bits:

 • Hypercall forwarding to userspace (KVM_CAP_HYPERV_FORWARD_HCALL),
   with completion or injected #UD, for the VSM hypercalls KVM
   doesn't handle itself
 • HvCallVtlCall/HvCallVtlReturn switching between planes in the
   kernel; forced VTL entry gated on interrupt deliverability and
   re-armed when a plane suspends with IRR set
 • Per-plane Hyper-V state: GUEST_OS_ID/HYPERCALL MSRs, the
   reference TSC page, SynIC and event routing, TLB flushes
 • VTL register intercepts, including the descriptor-table load
   traps Credential Guard requires
 • The suspended-VP state (from Nikolas Wipper's series), refusal of
   SendIpi to a higher VTL, XMM fast hypercall output
 • Selftests for both halves; a hyperv_vsm suite for kvm-unit-tests
   covering VTL call/return, protections, intercepts and eventing
   follows separately

The four WIP-marked patches need finishing and splitting; they are
included because the series does not function without them. This is
very much an RFC.

Held back in the git tree for a follow-up posting:

 • KVM_TRANSLATE2 and the page-walker flags/status work (also
   Nikolas's), and the HvCallTranslateVirtualAddress handling built
   on it
 • TLB flush inhibit (TlbLocked)

Not done at all yet: VINA, and migration of mid-VTL-switch state
(the forced-entry and captured-register state has no GET/SET
exposure). The interaction with SEV-SNP VMPLs, the other consumer of
planes, is untested from this side.

Mushahid also has a version which boots Windows 11 on arm64, which
we'll reconcile when some of the dust settles.

I think this will take a while to reconcile and merge, even after
the base dependencies (planes, memattrs, etc.) are in. I'd like to
start settling the basic functionality so we can start preparing
to merge it in little pieces, if we can reach a general consensus.
