Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v2 00/13] bpf: track scalar equality across the low 32 bits

The verifier's linked-scalar machinery tracks register equality only for
the full 64 bits, optionally with a constant delta. There is no way to
record "these two registers share just their low 32 bits", so a 32-bit
operation on a source with unknown high bits has to drop the relationship,
and a later narrowing of the source never reaches the destination:

The verifier's linked-scalar machinery tracks register equality only for
the full 64 bits, optionally with a constant delta. There is no way to
record "these two registers share just their low 32 bits", so a 32-bit
operation on a source with unknown high bits has to drop the relationship,
and a later narrowing of the source never reaches the destination:

  r6 = ...              /* full 64-bit unknown */
  w7 = w6               /* 32-bit zero-extending mov */
  if w6 != 0 goto ...   /* not taken: r6's low 32 bits are 0 */
  if w7 == 0 goto ...   /* not deduced today */

The same gap exists for the 32-bit sign extension, which is what prompted
this, and -- as pointed out on the RFC -- for loads, which can zero- or
sign-extend the same way. This series covers all four, plus the spill that
feeds a narrowing fill.

Record a low-32 link instead of dropping the relation. On a later
narrowing, sync_linked_regs() rebuilds such a register from the base by
re-applying the extension the original operation used, rather than copying
it. The reverse direction is skipped: a low-32 register knows nothing about
a full register's high half.

There is an upstream test that documents the missing capability directly.
verifier_reg_equal's "w reg not equal if r reg upper32 bits not 0" asserts
that w3 = w2 does not let a later w2 < 9 bound r3, and that the program is
therefore rejected. That bound is sound, so the test becomes __success
here.

Layout
======
The kinds live in bitfields rather than in the top bits of ->id, as
suggested on 1/6:

	enum bpf_add_const	add_const:2;
	enum bpf_subreg		subreg:2;

bpf_reg_state stays 80 bytes; 20 bits of padding remain.

Patches
=======
 1     move the kinds out of ->id [NFC]
 2     restore the kind comparison in regs_exact() that 1 drops
 3-4   zero-extending mov
 5-6   keep the range across a sign extension that cannot change it
 7-8   sign-extending mov
 9-10  narrowing fill
 11    record what a narrowing spill actually stores
 12-13 narrowing spill

5 and 11 are precision fixes that stand on their own; they are ordered
ahead of the linking patches that build on them.

Testing
=======
clang and bpf-gcc 20260721, x86_64:

  clang    129/2594 PASSED, 6 SKIPPED, 0/0 FAILED  (-t verifier)
  bpf-gcc  no new failures against the base

A full test_progs run on both the base and the series gives the same 28
distinct failures, with identical per-test failure counts.

Every patch builds individually.

Changes since the RFC [1]
=========================
6 patches became 13. In aggregate:

- The kinds are bitfields rather than a byte of flags, so RFC 1/6 is gone
  and RFC 2/6 shrank to patch 1.
- Two precision fixes were split out and ordered ahead of the linking
  patches that build on them: coerce_reg_to_size_sx() no longer widens a
  range it cannot change (5), and a narrowing spill records what it stored
  rather than the wider source (11). Both stand alone.
- Loads are covered, as asked for on the cover letter: the narrowing fill
  (9-10) and the narrowing spill that feeds it (12-13).
- regs_exact() regained a comparison the RFC lost when the kind left ->id
  (2).

Four of those differ from what was reviewed and are worth describing in
some detail:

- The wide-source mov no longer excludes an ADD_CONST source. This was
  suggested on 3/6 and it is the right call, but it has a cost:
  forming the link clears the source's base+delta relationship, so
  tracking that used to survive is lost. The two cannot both be kept -- a
  link the sync path skips would be inert -- and the delta shape is common
  in the codegen this targets. Patch 3 spells this out, and
  zext_mov_breaks_add_const_src pins it.

- reconstruct_sext32() does NOT reuse coerce_reg_to_size_sx(), despite that
  being the explicit ask on 5/6. The RFC's call-then-overwrite is gone --
  coerce_reg_to_size_sx() is fixed in patch 5 and the mov site now has a
  single sign-extension path. But the sync path cannot use it: it reads
  smin/smax, which straddle after a 32-bit compare and collapse to the full
  field range, so the link propagates nothing. It needs the base's 32-bit
  range instead, exactly as zext_32_to_64() does for the zero-extending
  side. Three tests failed on this before it was understood.

- The sign-extending self-mov is narrower than in the RFC. There,
  r0 = (s32)r0 was never excluded, because reconstruct_sext32() ran at the
  mov site to keep the range. Patch 5 now does that job, so the link is
  formed only when r0 already carries an id -- otherwise there is nothing
  to link to and minting one would leave the register describing itself.

- Patch 11 tightens the state recorded for every narrowing spill, including
  programs with no links at all. It is separated out for that reason.

[1] 20260814231945.3884596-1-vineet.gupta@linux.dev

Two notes on the tests:

- The two sign-extension range tests live in verifier_movsx.c rather than
  verifier_linked_scalars.c, contrary to the request on 4/6. They exercise
  the range a sign-extending mov produces, not the ->id machinery, and that
  file already gates on the cpuv4 support they need.

- Three tests that were named *_link_mismatch_blocks_pruning are now named
  for what they actually check. Disabling the ->subreg comparison in
  regsafe() does not make them fail: the states they compare differ in ids,
  contents or ranges, so regsafe() keeps them apart for reasons of its own.
  They verify an outcome, not that specific guard.

Still open
==========
- The kind comparison in regsafe() has no test that isolates it, like the
  pre-existing add_const comparison. The shape it guards is old being a
  superset of cur -- old SUBREG_ZEXT over [0, U32_MAX] against cur
  SUBREG_SEXT over [0, 100] passes range_within(), and without the
  comparison a later sync_linked_regs() would rebuild cur by the wrong
  rule. Whenever the kinds differ in a way a program can construct directly
  the ranges differ too, so the range checks reject first. Suggestions
  welcome.

- The fill arm mints an id when spill_size == 4, but the clearing test does
  not mention spill_size. A narrow value spilled at 8 bytes and filled at 4
  therefore inherits a full 64-bit link without the minting gate running.
  This predates the series; patch 9 builds on that arm without changing it.
  Is it deliberate?

- regs_exact() loses the kind comparison for exactly one patch, between 1
  and 2. They can be folded if the [NFC] label matters more than the bisect
  step.
