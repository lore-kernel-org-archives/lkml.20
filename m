I misunderstood what you meant by per-device.  v7 reworks this in the
hid_bpf_ops style: one struct_ops instance per device, with the target
device identified through the struct_ops instance.  .reg binds it to
the device and .unreg detaches it and restores the builtin model.  The
name registry, lifecycle list and additional refcounting layer are
gone; attaching a second model to an already-bound device fails with
-EBUSY.

calc_cost() takes the bio itself now, so the model can read the
operation, size, sector and issuing cgroup from it; only the merge
indicator stays in the separate flags argument.

Done: the callbacks are bound to the iocg pd init and free paths,
giving the model the same per-(cgroup, device) lifetime as the builtin
cursor and avoiding the global mutex in the cgroup online/offline
paths.

The pricing paths now use the transfer cost coefficients (vtime per page
for reads and writes) provided by the struct_ops while the model is
attached.  This covers completion-time request sizing, latency tracking
and vrate adjustment, which no longer use the linear coefficients in
this case.  There is one remaining model call in the completion path in
my current tree which does not belong to this interface; it will be
removed in the posted version.

Understood.  The QoS-side takeover (rq_done() and kfunc-based vrate
and saturation control) stays out of this series.

Yes, coefficient writes are stored and take effect again on detach.
autop will only step profiles when no model is attached, matching the
user-set cost model behavior.  io.cost.model readback will report the
BPF model in the model field while ctrl continues to describe the
coefficient source (user/auto).

I'll send the reworked series.
