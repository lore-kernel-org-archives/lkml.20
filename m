It's all incredibly tricky and I felt my brain melting out of my head going
through the psuedocode/definition yesterday so it's understandable :)

Yeah agreed.

Ack thanks!

Thanks!

Yeah it's all very complicated, unfortunately I think, the psuedocode had me
stumped a lot when I was reading it...

Definitely agree on all-or-nothing. If we did go the 'all' route, then we'd
need to put in the ELIsInHost(EL2) conditional too
i.e. vcpu_el2_e2h_is_set() as well.

But I think simplifying that is also valid, as the resultant function above
is a lot easier to reason about and avoids people having to figure out that
certain bits are irrelevant (though comments could square that off too!)

Yeah that's clear thanks!

IOW - the register/El/state decides _whether_ an exception can be raised,
the running EL's EXLOCKEN is what is consulted _when_ it can be raised.
