Hi Rafael, Robin,

I have not started prototyping it yet but I have got a question as a
follow-up to our chat at LPC about crafting an ACPI device for the static
table entries and sort out the probe dependencies using autodep.

After spur of the moment reaction during the session, I now remember I
thought about crafting an ACPI device for the static table entries and
started digging then bumped into acpi_add_single_object() as you
suggested.

The point though is: what about the acpi_handle and the AML required to
sort out the dependencies using the _CRS ? We have got the info to fill
the _CRS coming from static table entries (MMIO, GSI) but I am not sure how I
can form a full-fledged ACPI namespace object in the kernel, without
that in place I am not sure how the autodep mechanism can possibly
work.

I need to have a deeper look into this next week but I wanted to ask first
whether there was something I missed - most likely.

Thanks !
Lorenzo
