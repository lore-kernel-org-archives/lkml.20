Exactly right.

Event handling in the core would indeed require complex mapping of
what can actually be enabled on a given device. Some of those we might
be able to represent with simple approaches similar to what we do
for avail_scan_masks for buffered channels but it is hard to generalize
and FWIW that concept still misses some corner cases of channel enabling
where drivers have to apply constraints in the actual buffer enable.
Those are rare enough that it isn't too much of a problem in practice.
Probably fine on 99% of drivers.

Events have simplre cases like:
- 1 enable bit turns a whole load of events on (we don't filter in
  the kernel - so userspace has to cope with surprise events).
- Always on event signals.
- Limited numbers of general purpose event engines (the ADI IMUs do
  this as they tend to have 2 instances). Each engine can do anything
  but there are only two of them.

We also have more complex ones like mode bits that flip a subset
of events from one enable state to another.  There are some really
odd rules in some devices because some upstream filter that is needed
for 5 seemingly unrelated events has to be in a particular state for
subsets of them.

Anyhow, all in all event control is a mess of 'original solutions'
from vendors and relies on the (naughty) get out of IIO ABI that
just occasionally any write to any userspace ABI element can
change what is read back from any other.

Not great, but I've never come up with a better solution for events.
If anyone wants to have a go at architecting a filtering solution
a bit like the IIO buffer demux maybe we can opt in to it from
some drivers.

I am wondering if it is worth registering a driver specific tidy
up events call though that would disable everything a bit like
we disable buffers as part of the userspace tear down.  That would
close out some races sashiko has reported.  That project would
I think be a lot simpler to implement.
