Well I guess we'll get the same answer that this is too late in the boot
process.

My proposed solution is to have a way to tell the kernel what size of
time_t userspace actually supports as there is no way to automatically
detect it. That's why I was thinking a kernel cmdline parameter would
fit. This would allow us to be 100% correct.

Else, I'm fine with your last proposal. I guess this would leave us with
two unhandled cases:
 - 64bit systems with 32 bit userspace that you said we don't want to
   support
 - 32bit systems with 64bit time_t userspace that would not work
   properly with the default configuration.
