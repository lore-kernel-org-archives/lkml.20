OK, thanks for explaining!

You seem to be arguing that the current behavior is counter-intuitive
because people would generally expect the parent's (or supplier's)
last_busy to be automatically advanced to the last "busy" time of its
last active child (or consumer).

That is a bit far-fetched IMV because the child's last "busy" time
need not be the same as the parent's last "busy" time, at least in
principle (of course, that is debatable, but that debate can be had
later).

Still, the underlying observation seems to be that if the child
suspends and then resumes relatively shortly, it may not make sense to
suspend and resume the parent in the meantime, which is fair enough.
Of course, advancing the parent's last_busy will only help here if its
autosuspend delay is long enough though.

So you can argue that if the parent's autosuspend delay is long
enough, then it should prevent the parent from suspending across
relatively short periods of child suspension.  Again, this is fair
enough, so why does it not happen at times?

It certainly does happen when the parent actually has to resume
because rpm_resume() calls pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() for it then and
(given a sufficiently long autosuspend delay) it will stay active if
the child resumes a short enough time after suspending.  However, when
the child resumes, the parent is still active, so rpm_resume()
triggered by the child does not advance its last_busy timestamp, so at
one point in the future it will suspend when the child suspends.

This arguably is inconsistent, so my approach to addressing the
problem at hand would be the attached patch (sorry for the attachment,
but GMail is generally not good at handling appended patches).  If I'm
not mistaken, it should be sufficient to address the particular issue
that triggered commit c537d3457542.

Note that I'm not worried about the potential raciness of this new
last_busy update with other possible concurrent updates of last_busy
because they all use approximations of the current time and if they
are close enough to each other, it should not matter who wins the
race.

Of course, it can be argued this way though there are
counter-arguments (probably not worth discussing in detail at this
point) and there is the question how much of a difference this would
make after addressing the rpm_resume() inconsistency mentioned above
(which IMV needs to be address regardless because it is not limited to
the parent-child or supplier-consumer situations).

Or not, depending on why user space flips the "control" attribute
which is not known to the kernel.

It would really have helped if that had been described properly in the
changelog of commit c537d3457542.  Oh well.

So I'm wondering how much of this will still be needed with the
attached patch applied.

But at the point when the first config space access takes place, it is
unclear that the next one will happen, which is part of the problem
here: The child resume needs to be expected to happen shortly for all
of this to make sense.
