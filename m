I still can't see how that would be necessary. Sure SVA has to cope with 
invalidating any old arbitarily-sized range that could have been a mix 
of pages, blocks, cont, whatever - that's fair enough. But for 
io-pgtable through the IOMMU API, a partial unmap of anyhthing which 
could have been mapped as a cont range would already be invalid and 
should fail. Thus for any unmap which could validly include any cont 
ranges, iommu_pgsize() would have already picked a granularity that is 
some multiple of the largest cont range size being unmapped, so even if 
the total gathered size exceeds a single command, we still wouldn't 
split it _within_ any single one of those ranges, only at a boundary 
between two unrelated ones.

Thanks,
Robin.
