I see an upside with this approach: we could keep one single rate
negotiation logic. But it still requires modifications to be done on a
per user basis to be enabled (but that is needed from your perspective).

While I fully understand all the concerns expressed above, there has
been one minor point that arose while working on your series: it's
very hard to determine the tolerance beyond which the clock rate shall
be refused. Expect bikeshedding on a per driver basis.

Well, yeah, I see we share conclusions :-)

I managed to pull most of the clock patches in your branch and apply
them to my 7.2 branch (with a couple of tweaks). I then made the changes
to request a tolerance as you hinted (available below) in the two
relevant drivers: it worked as expected!

While doing so, I realized the whole operation (set rate, set rate
range, get rate and verify) needs to be repeated almost identically in
every user of the "tolerance composition" logic, which probably
indicates that a core helper would be relevant instead. I had in mind
something like ~clk_set_rate_and_tolerance() which would do the
equivalent of my fsl_ldb_link_rate_set() and lcdif_pixel_rate_set()
helpers.

In case that is relevant, here is below the code snippet which I used to
get my panels working after removing the assigned rates from the DTS on
i.MX8MP.
