As I said in PUCK, this is going to be painful to support, both now and in the
future.  We _could_ get it working, but I'm not at all convinced that I want to
commit to supporting Secure AVIC in its current form.

Though on a slightly happier note, I was wrong about KVM_X86_QUIRK_SLOT_ZAP_ALL.
That quirk only applies to KVM_X86_DEFAULT_VM VMs, i.e. wouldn't need to be
manually disabled for SNP.

And if we go with my suggestion[1] to force KVM_MEMSLOT_GMEM_ONLY when binding to
a gmem instance with in-place conversion enabled, then the fix/optimization to
ignore mmu_notifiers for gmem-only memslots will avoids spurious zaps on that
front[2].

However, there are still problems.  E.g. when converting memory, userspace would
need to make sure to never do a redundant/superfluous KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2
on a range that contains a Secure AVIC page, because __kvm_gmem_set_attributes()
will tell the MMU to invalidate SHARED mappings for the entire range.  I.e. by
design, guest_memfd will not chunk the invalidations based on the per-page state
of PRIVATE vs. SHARED, because cross-referencing the current attributes would
incur non-trivial complexity.  For TDX, this isn't a problem because the S-EPT
is a separate paging structure, and so kvm_gfn_range_filter_to_root_types() can
simply skip MIRROR roots to avoid over-zapping PRIVATE memory.  SNP doesn't have
such a thing.

Converting a subset of a huge PRIVATE page would also be problematic, although
that one isn't so bad since we already need to call into the TDP MMU to pre-split
S-EPT pages, because those too can't tolerate spurious zappings.

Those are solvable problems, but I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to take on
the complexity to support what IMO is a poorly designed feature.  There's a very
good reason why control pages are referenced by their host PA in both the VMCS
and VMCB.

TDX's S-EPT obviously has similar restrictions, but with S-EPT the downsides are
a direct tradeoff of the benefits.  Tracking ownership in the page tables to avoid
the complexity and performance costs with an out-of-band table obviously requires
preserving those page tables.  For Secure AVIC, AFAICT it's simply a bad design.

Honestly, this feels a lot like Supervisor Shadow Stacks on Intel, where an EPT
Violation in the middle of a shadow stack access would be destructive to guest
state without a very heavy lift in the hypervisor.  And I'm pretty sure the
feedback to Intel was "provide a better implemetnation" (wait for FRED, maybe?).
