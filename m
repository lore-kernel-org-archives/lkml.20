Why would a USB device have anything to do with device tree?

Cute, but that's a total abuse of the USB standard.  Why wasn't this
implemented by the proper "each channel is a USB interface" model
instead?  Have the firmware engineers there not read the USB spec?

Again cute, but that's not how USB devices are supposed to work, why
would we want to do this at all?

USB devices do not have DT bindings.  It's a dynamic bus, with
self-describing devices, don't make the mistake of thinking this is
giong to work.

So you have a custom "bus" for a single USB device/interface?  Ick,
again, why?  Please do this the "proper" way in your firmware and do
this one-device-per-usb-interface like the rest of the world does
please.

Doing it that way will not cost any more hardware pins at all, it's all
handled in firmware, and as you all have complete control over the
firmware, you can fix this up now to do things properly.

Neither is ok for USB devices, that's not an argument either way.

Please go talk to some people with USB spec experience on how to make a
multi-function device correctly.  This way sure does not look like it at
all.
