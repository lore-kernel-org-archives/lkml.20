Hi Cristian,

So, the main issue here is pretty much summarized by:

 28 files changed, 12801 insertions(+), 99 deletions(-)
(obviously there are tests etc, but it's still > 10k lines)

There are relatively few reviewers who would even consider taking that on.
I foolishly thought it wouldn't be too bad (and I review a lot of code).
By about 3/4 of the way though, probably much earlier, I know the quality
of review went down considerably. Honestly it was probably a waste of
time continuing but I'm stubborn like that.

So, unless you have a path to bribing or sweet talking various folk to
deal with reviewing this with each having to set aside multiple days
to do it, likely repeating for a couple of versions yet, I think you've
got to figure out out how to make the first patch set more manageable.
Probably don't split it up as much as the mpam or CCA folk have had to,
but you have a lot of colleagues who are experiencing the same problem
at the moment. They may be able to advise.

So it would be nice if what was in that first patch set was 'functional'
but I don't think it needs to function on every systems or support more
than an absolutely minimal feature set.  Just fail to probe when you see
something that isn't supported by that minimal set if that means
the thing won't be functional.

Once that's in place, over a couple of additional patch sets you can
get to everything you have here.

So what if you choose one data path (shmti perhaps), no notifications,
events, maybe even simplify to one of the readback paths.
Maybe even drop event groups initially. 
Possibly even drop timestamps.  Definitely drop things like boot-on
support and debugfs (unless you are using that as a cheeky 'functional'
test ahead of the main userspace interface.

How much would that slim things down?  It doesn't even have to be
useful, just testable.  Realistically I think the hope of getting
enough review doubles if you can halve the size of what you are asking
people to look at.

Anyhow, gut feeling only but the code felt like it was in a much
better state than some of the versions I've looked at in the past,
so I think the game is now how to get it over the line!

Thanks,

Jonathan
