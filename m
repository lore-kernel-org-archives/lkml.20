Yes, I should clean that up.

The class associated with a resource does double duty and is also used as an indication of whether
the resource is in used at all, see also mpam_resctrl_online_cpu() and mpam_resctrl_offline_cpu().
When a resource only supports monitoring then the class providing the monitors is used for
res->class. As such, a check that there is a component for the given cpu, in the monitor only
resource case, is just a way to error out early when the monitoring class has no cpu. We shouldn't
hit this though as all monitoring classes are check that they have the same topology of the l3,
cover all cpus and there components correspond to l3 instances.

The resource supports monitoring but not controls case only occurs when there are no l3 controls and
the condidtions for pretending the memory bandwidth counters at the memory are at the l3 are met.
Those conditions for pretending occur when there is single l3, a single NUMA node and no
intermediate caches.

Yes, I think is the "ctrl_comp" check is taken away but would have failed we will end up not finding
any relevant monitoring components.

Although, as written it seems that it is ok for mon_comp to be NULL?

Isn't any_mon_comp the relevant thing?

Doesn't the !any_mon_comp check provide this?

In the spirit of getting the precursors for your PoC upstream I think it would make sense to work on
this for upstream. Whatever you think is best for progressing multiple control support is ok with me
though.
