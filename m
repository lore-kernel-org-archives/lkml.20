I guess software node properties look inviting in theory since they're a 
ready-made mechanism for effectively attaching arbitrary data to a 
fwnode, however looking at patches 6-7 and the amount of boilerplate 
involved in the reality, I'm inclined to think that a dedicated 
structure for static nodes is probably the best and most efficient 
compromise here. The redundancy argument rather falls apart once we end 
up creating copies of those contentiously-made-up property name strings 
for every node, especially given that any one of those alone is probably 
already more than the amount of actual data we need per node...

Perhaps the "purest" option might be to just store a function pointer in 
the fwnode wrapper for each static table type to provide its own 
internal irq_get() callback, so not stashing intermediate GSI data at 
all, but I suspect that might end up being more work overall.

Cheers,
Robin.
