I think this is indeed a pre-existing issue, as Sashiko pointed out:

the current mapping check on the folio2 and the folio !=
page_folio(split_at) check in __folio_split() are not able to catch this
problem, which could then cause folio2 to be split at the wrong
position. Does that sound right?

Following your suggestion, I reworked my existing patch to use
__filemap_get_folio(), and it ends up looking roughly like the
following(not tested yet). What do you think?

Besides, if the issue Sashiko pointed out does indeed exist, I can
extract the __filemap_get_folio() change into a separate patch to fix it
on its own.

Thanks,
Yi.
