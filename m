HI Krzysztof,

I am writing to kindly follow up on my previous inquiry regarding the 
binding filename for the flattened representation.

To recap, I would like to know if we should use a common binding 
filename, such as samsung,exynos-dwc3-flattened.yaml, instead of SoC 
specific names (e.g., samsung,exynos8855-dwc3.yaml). This would be 
consistent with how samsung,exynos-dwc3.yaml covers multiple SoCs in the 
legacy representation, especially if we expect to support multiple 
Exynos SoCs with only clock differences in the future.

I would appreciate your guidance or suggestions on the preferred naming 
convention for this implementation.

Thanks,
Selva
