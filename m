It is :)

How about "... permissions of the direct mapping of the page frame
represented by a struct page"?

... some architectures restrict ranges that can be modified. For

Here it's an example of arch-private APIs, so I'd rather keep it. I'll
extend the intro sentence to make it more clear.

Yes, the split may be partial and. I'll make it clearer.

I liked more their set_direct_map part :)
