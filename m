It depends on whether KVM allows userspace to set features for TDs that are not support
for non-TDX VMs (,except for a few exceptions).

In this version, TDX_CFG_F() already check against kvm_cpu_caps[], if these features
are not in kvm_cpu_caps[], it will not be exposed to userspace anyway.

Sean mentioned it that "generally speaking, KVM shouldn't allow features
that KVM doesn't support for non-TDX VMs" in
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/aj1fi_0SBxMK5WOB@google.com/

I think the risk is pretty low.
I am not sure if Sean could provide some insight about this in google's userspace
VMM.
