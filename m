This patch series adds support for the Andes ATCDMAC300 DMA controller,
a memory-to-memory and peripheral DMA controller that provides
scatter-gather, cyclic, and slave transfer capabilities.

The ATCDMAC300 IP is embedded in AndesCore-based platforms or SoCs
such as AE350 and Qilai.

v7 drew eight findings from sashiko-bot, and Frank Li asked for each to
be fixed or explained. Five are fixed here. The other three are
answered in the reply to v7 rather than changed:

  - Terminal count and error arriving together:
    The data sheet defines the terminal count status as being set only
    when a transfer finishes without an error or abort event, and only
    one transfer is in flight on a channel at a time, so the two cannot
    both describe the same transfer.

  - Descriptors a client prepares and never submits:
    The desc_free half does not apply, as the driver does not set
    descriptor_reuse and so that callback is unreachable; for the rest
    the API offers no unprepare a driver could hook.  No in-tree client
    of this driver prepares a transfer it does not submit.

  - Endianness conversions:
    The driver depends on ARCH_ANDES and Linux has no big-endian RISC-V,
    so the conversions would be no-ops everywhere this can be built, and
    struct atcdmac_regs is both the linked list node the controller reads
    and the staging copy fed to regmap_write(), so the fields would be
    converted on the way in and converted straight back on the way out.

v7: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260916134258.2178081-1-cl634@andestech.com

Changes in v8:
  - Fold in fourteen further correctness fixes; no interface or binding
    change. Five of them answer the v7 findings above; the remaining
    nine come from a review of the whole driver.
  - Descriptor lifetime:
      - Track cyclic mode on the descriptor rather than on the channel;
        a cyclic and a non-cyclic transfer on one channel could leave the
        flag set for the wrong descriptor and dereference a NULL callback
      - Drop the num_sg field, which was written but never read
  - Suspend and resume:
      - Restore stop_mask when suspend times out, instead of leaving
        every channel stopped for good
      - Start transfers that were queued while suspended
  - Driver model:
      - Do not offer the controller for unbinding; a client holding a
        channel across an unbind would run against devres memory that
        remove() has already released
  - Register encoding:
      - Reject a DMA request line the request-select field cannot hold,
        rather than truncating it silently
      - Keep the burst field out of its reserved range, which the
        controller reports as an error exception
      - Refuse a transfer width the width field cannot encode
  - Slave configuration:
      - Clear the stored configuration when a channel is allocated, so a
        client cannot inherit the previous one's device address
      - Accept a configuration that describes only the direction it uses
      - Reject a length that is not a whole number of device-width units,
        which either transfers fewer bytes than asked for or programs a
        zero transfer size
  - Probe:
      - Use struct_size() for the channel array, which is already
        declared with __counted_by()
      - Check the configuration register read, and refuse a channel count
        of zero rather than registering a controller with no channels
  - Cleanups:
      - Return a bool from the channel-enabled helper rather than a value
        that is negative on a failed register read; pass a register value
        rather than a bool to regmap_update_bits(); use
        dma_cookie_status() directly

Changes in v7:
  - Rebase onto the current dmaengine/next
  - Fold in twelve correctness fixes found by review and confirmed on an
    FPGA; no interface or binding change
  - Interrupt path:
      - Acknowledge only the status bits that were actually read
      - Key the acknowledge on channel ownership instead of on in-flight
        state the handler itself clears, which could leave a completion
        unacknowledged until the core disabled the line
      - Use raw spinlocks for the state shared with the hard IRQ handler
  - Termination and descriptor lifetime:
      - Do not run the callback twice, or recycle a descriptor, when a
        transfer is terminated while its completion is in flight
      - Initialise desc_node when a descriptor is allocated
      - Wait for the channel to stop without holding the channel lock;
        the poll could spin 100 ms with interrupts disabled
  - Suspend and resume:
      - Move the PM callbacks to the late phase so clients terminate their
        transfers first, and name the channels that fail to idle
      - Drain in-flight completions across suspend and resume
      - Do not restart an idle cyclic channel on resume
  - Probe:
      - Register the DMA device only after the interrupt and cache
        coherency setup, closing a window in which a client could obtain a
        channel through dma_request_channel() on an unready controller
      - Do not read-modify-write write-only registers
      - Name the device in the probe-time reset error

Changes in v6:
  - Rebase onto dmaengine/next; no functional changes from v5
  - Fold the MAINTAINERS entry into the driver patch instead of carrying
    it as a separate patch (series is now 2 patches)

Changes in v5:
  - Update copyright year to 2026
  - Remove redundant headers (init.h, iopoll.h, mod_devicetable.h)
  - Move atcdmac_init_iocp() before of_dma_controller_register() in probe
  - Change builtin_platform_driver() to module_platform_driver()
  - Implement .remove callback to support safe module unloading
  - Update Kconfig entry from bool to tristate
  - Add MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_DESCRIPTION, MODULE_LICENSE macros

Changes in v4:
  - Use items list format with descriptions for reg property in DT binding
    as suggested by Conor Dooley
  - Re-add Acked-by from Conor Dooley for DT binding patch

Changes in v3:
  - Rename DT binding file from andestech,qilai-dma.yaml to
    andestech,ae350-dma.yaml
  - Deprecate IP-core-based compatible usage and align with
    SoC/platform-based strings
  - Dropped Acked-by from Conor Dooley due to the above binding change
  - Remove "andestech,atcdmac300" from of_device_id table
  - Replace deprecated tasklet with threaded IRQ using
    devm_request_threaded_irq() and IRQF_ONESHOT
  - Update locking from spin_lock_bh() to spin_lock_irqsave()
  - Use builtin_platform_driver() instead of module_platform_driver()
  - Remove "select DMATEST" from Kconfig
  - Add separate MAINTAINERS patch (patch 3/3)

Please kindly review.
