Well, by definition nothing that changes in the kernel should break at
least tools/perf, see:

tools/include/uapi/README

"
Why we want a copy of kernel headers in tools?
==============================================

There used to be no copies, with tools/ code using kernel headers
directly. From time to time tools/perf/ broke due to legitimate kernel
hacking. At some point Linus complained about such direct usage. Then we
adopted the current model.
"

So tools shouldn't be using anything outside tools and people updating
tools/ living shared headers should test the other subsystems that use
it.

Recently I added:

⬢ [acme@toolbx perf-tools-next]$ make -C tools/perf help | grep headers
  check-headers         - check which header copies are out of sync with the kernel
  sync-headers          - sync those header copies with the kernel, creating commits
⬢ [acme@toolbx perf-tools-next]$

That calls:

acme@phoenix2:~/git/perf-tools-next$ tools/perf/scripts/sync-headers.sh --help
Usage: sync-headers.sh [OPTIONS]

Sync tools/ header copies with the kernel sources and create commits.
<SNIP>
The script:
  1. Runs 'make -C tools/perf check-headers' to find stale copies.
  2. For each stale header, identifies the kernel commits that changed it,
     including the merges that brought content of their own.
  3. Copies the kernel header into the tools/ tree, skipping it when only
     the tools/ copy changed (it is ahead) or when it carries intentional
     edits, and stopping for manual investigation when both sides have
     content the other lacks.
  4. For beauty headers, runs the relevant beauty script(s) before and
     after, showing new/changed string table entries.
  5. Builds perf and the other consumers of the header to verify nothing
     breaks.
  6. Creates a git commit per header (or group) with the standard commit
     message format.

     -----

See point #5.

Having more people testing that perf continues to build if the existing
rules described above is only good and I thank you for the work you are
doing, I just wanted to clarify how tools/perf/ has been working with
this over the years and the recent extra scripting around the updates
that we do while maintaining tools/perf.
