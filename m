Which is rather unfortunate.

They should appear under the MSFT1000:00 platform device corresponding
to the ACPI device with the same name.

Anyway, it looks like older systemd may be thinking that they are ACPI
devices and may be looking for drivers in /sys/bus/acpi/drivers/.

To kind of check that this is the case, can you replace "use_drivers"
with "true" in the first check in bus_register_internal() only (with
the $subject patch applied, of course)?  That would leave the
"drivers" directory in place, but it would skip the creation of the
probe files.

Well, the fact of life is that it can't cope with the changes made by
the $subject patch, but maybe we can get away with a simpler one, so
please check the above.

I'll drop the $subject patch from linux-next at least for now.

BTW, do you know why vmbus_acpi_add() does this:

ACPI_COMPANION_SET(&device->dev, device);

which essentially attempts to make an ACPI device become an ACPI
companion of itself and is useless and broken?

If this is done to work around something, there may be a design issue
in that driver.

Thanks!
