Thanks for working on this, I really love the idea and more efficient
allocation complexity. For long-term maintainability a few things need to be
sorted out, though.

First, I will ask AMDs IOMMU driver team to do some performance and regression
tests with this series.

This is a lot for the interface contract between the IOVA code and the Maple
tree. We need a way to test and enforce that the maple tree implementation
adheres to the requirements of the IOMMU code going forward. You mention that
there is a test included, not sure if it covers all expectations this code has
(especially when the expectations are different from the ones in core MM code).

The last thing we want is regressions in one of the IOMMU-layers core
componentents because of changes to core MM code.
