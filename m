The patch doesn't remove any todo lines. Was that just a miss, or is 
there more to add wrt. PM?

What does it mean it didn't support PM? Does the driver not work after 
suspend-resume cycle? Or does the driver prevent a proper suspend?

It still sounds like a separate patch to me: the current driver is 
missing phy_power_on/off from the probe/remove functions.

I think it would be best to be able somehow to ask this from the HW to 
find the true state, instead of guessing it second hand from the PD 
notifier (which also doesn't tell us the initial HW state at probe).

KEEP_ALIVE_p sounds fine. Or what does the mdhp IP do if you send a 
message to the firmware when it's not up? Say, if you always do 
cdns_mhdp_set_firmware_active, what happens if the FW has not been 
loaded? I would guess that there's a timeout, and that could be used to 
find out the FW is not up.

Also, if the IMEM is not accessible and you load the FW, what happens?
