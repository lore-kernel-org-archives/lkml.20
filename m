Hi all

In the v16, sashiko-bot suggested to add a pmu->lock in ->read()
again, let me address this, and explain why I would prefer to leave it
as a documented limitation in this series rather than respin.

What I would like to push back on is the suggested fix, because every
point fix in this area has already been reviewed and rejected in an
earlier round of this series:

  - Taking pmu->lock in ->read() (which is literally the diff
suggested here) was in v7-resend. It was rejected: a BPF program
reading an IOMMU PMU event from NMI context via bpf_perf_event_read()
invokes pmu->read(), and if that NMI lands on a CPU already holding
pmu->lock in the IRQ handler or in ->add(), the read callback spins
forever.
  - raw_spin_trylock_irqsave() in ->read() was the v13 answer to that.
It was rejected in v14: on cross-CPU contention the trylock fails,
->read() returns without updating, and userspace silently gets a stale
count.
  - The current lockless form is what v15 and v16 are objecting to.

So the three obvious shapes for ->read() have each been rejected, in
each case for a valid reason. That is a strong hint that ->read() is
the wrong place to fix this: the actual root cause is that the
overflow handler may run off the bound CPU at all.

Worth noting that no PMU driver under drivers/perf/ (including all the
hisilicon ones) or arch/x86/events/intel/uncore.c takes a spinlock in
its ->read() callback -- not even on x86, which does have NMI-context
perf events. They don't need to, because they pin the overflow
interrupt to on_cpu with irq_set_affinity(), so the handler and the
perf callbacks all run on the same CPU, and ->read() is already
invoked there with interrupts disabled (smp_call_function_single()
from perf_event_read(), or the event_cpu =3D=3D smp_processor_id() check
in perf_event_read_local()). Same-CPU plus interrupts-disabled is the
entire synchronisation mechanism, and it is why the
prev_count/hardware pair cannot be observed half-updated.

RISC-V IOMMU PMU driver does the same irq_set_affinity() call, but on
IMSIC the move can be deferred, so the guarantee is weaker. Hence the
race. On the scope of the impact, to explain why I think this can
wait:
  - The consequence is confined to a reported count. prev_count and
event->count are local64_t and the cmpxchg cannot tear, so there is no
memory-safety issue, no oops, and no effect on IOMMU operation itself.
  - The window requires an affinity change to be in flight.
riscv_iommu_pmu_bind_cpu() is only called from the CPU hotplug online
and offline callbacks, so a deferred move is only pending during CPU
hotplug. In steady state the interrupt is already on on_cpu, ->read()
runs on that same CPU with interrupts disabled, and the window does
not exist. This is a transient during hotplug, not the common case.

That is a structural change to the interrupt path with several
interacting constraints, each of which has already caused a regression
in this series once. I would rather not fold it into this series at
this point, both because it deserves review on its own and because
getting it wrong again in a hurry is worse than a documented
counter-accuracy limitation during hotplug. So my proposal is: leave
the code as-is for this series, add a comment on
riscv_iommu_pmu_read() recording the limitation and why the three
obvious fixes are not used, and address it in a follow-up patchset.

Please let me know if you want me to do more for this series.
Thanks!
