I could not create enough load on my local QEMU VM to cause a lockup, so I am relying only on the Azure VM I have. I would not rule out x86 for this issue, as we have seen spurious lockups in the fleet, which are more common on certain SKUs, but my current experiments are limited to arm64. The proposed solution should solve it for both.

Acked.

I do not see an ITS, LPIs/vLPIs, GICv4 VPEs, or another direct virtual interrupt injection interface exposed to the guest. Also, posted/direct interrupts would reduce host-to-guest interrupt injection overhead, but the lockup here occurs after delivery, while nvme_irq() repeatedly drains completion queues in guest hardirq context. So I would not expect posted interrupts alone to provide the missing scheduling boundary.

Sure, happy to collaborate. Please include me in any new discussions you 
have in your patch. And let's hear what Christoph and other maintainers 
have to say, and then we can converge on that approach going forward.
