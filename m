It is so we can test with and without augmentation. With augmentation
the BPF program generates all the data so it can be filtered, etc. in
BPF. Even if the augmentation doesn't happen the BPF program writes
the raw data into the ring buffer for output. That's why the
separation you requested earlier isn't possible without introducing
broken intermediate states.

When augmentation and BPF are disabled, events are written to the ring
buffer using the normal tracepoint method and must be filtered, etc.
in the user space code. We need both modes because loading a BPF
program may not be possible and perf trace must continue working. This
flag allows testing data generated by both BPF and tracepoints.

A viable alternative is to generate both BPF and tracepoint data, but
that seemed very inefficient due to the amount of data that would go
in the ring buffer.
