I believe the RMM should report a value that represents the situation
better. In this case, there is a hole, and some conventional memory
areas. For the conventional memory, the RMM has to manage the GPTs.
(This applies to the tf-RMM implementation of TRACKING Granule state
too. It only looks at the first granule and reports the type of memory.)

RMI_GPT_PAR_RESERVED is not accurate as the memory region is not
reserved, unless it is reserved for firmware (in which case the
memory description is wrong).

I would say RMI_GPT_PAR_PLAT  is accurate if the L1GPT exists, as the
  region covered by the L0GPT has some memory that are delegable.

Otherwise it must be reported as RMI_GPT_HOST_NOT_CREATED.

The information that a given memory region is not "memory" (i.e. hole)
is basically TRACKING_STATE returned as RMI_MEM_CATEGORY_NONE
