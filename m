Ok. So we are effectively making that mux part of of the ad4134 controlled =
hardware.
I guess I don't mind that but shout about it a lot in the driver as anyone =
coming
in will wonder where the magic mux appeared from :)

It's errors that concern me about this.  Maybe it's the best we can do.

We went through that discussion IIRC for the original chaining devices and =
it
ends up too odd as there is no way for userspace to know that we have this
strange interacting set of devices.

I don't totally follow that detail, but indeed the control SPI plane would =
be independent
and so we'd need to do something to get that from the binding in a way that=
 distinguishes
it from other spi controllers.  The device would be sitting on two SPI buss=
es, one
of which had the multi channel properties.

To me this one is more natural but I can see both might get built and the c=
omplexity
of representing that as an SPI mux would be you'd be using part of a wider =
spi controller.
Hence I guess maybe the hidden (ish) mux is the way to go.
