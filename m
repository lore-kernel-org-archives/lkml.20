Hi Baolin,

Thanks for your feedback.
After thinking it over, I agree with you. I was only looking at the 
issue from the shmem side previously, which was indeed one-sided. The 
swapin paths for anonymous memory and shmem are essentially the same 
problem.

I didn’t explain the eBPF part clearly. What I meant is that the order 
policy and demotion decisions are handled inside these functions and not 
exposed externally, which imposes certain limitations on eBPF.

If feasible, I plan to consider both anonymous memory and shmem going 
forward, unify the logic, and provide a common interface.

I also note that the cover letter was too long. I will keep this in mind 
for future submissions.

Best regards,
Xuewen
