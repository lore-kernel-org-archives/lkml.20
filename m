No, it does not. Thanks for pointing this out. It is indeed unnecessary

Agreed. The patch only selects the reclaim source and otherwise preserves
the existing memory.reclaim behavior. I will make that clearer.

Yes, the percentage is the final deviation from the 50:50 target:

 =C2=A0 max(abs(dram_ratio - 0.5), abs(cxl_ratio - 0.5))

I should have stated that directly. I will make the test metric clearer
in v3.

That makes sense. I will try to extend the tests to cover system-wide
pressure and multiple active cgroups in v3.

Agreed, and sorry for making this too long. I will make v3 much shorter
and drop the separate cover letter if it remains a single patch.
