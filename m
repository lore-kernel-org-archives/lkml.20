I dunno, if 32 of 36 have a mask that sounds more like there is a
standard for all practical purposes but we've got a few drivers that
could be improved to better implement things.  This is quite common with
mixer-test - we generally enforce things relatively laxly compared to
the spec.  It's probably more helpful all round to add the missing mixer
controls.

Yes, I think this is a reasonable thing to add - like I was saying above
it's realtively common given our lack of enforcement and general driver
quality for us to see existing bugs.  Hopefully someone with the
hardware will notice and take a look, or if they don't perhaps it's not
actually causing them problems anyway.

Thanks for working on this!
