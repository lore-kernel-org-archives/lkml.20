selftests: can: add J1939 test helper header and library

This adds j1939_tests.h, which holds the shared C helpers for the J1939
selftests, and j1939_lib.sh, which holds the shared vcan setup, teardown
and test runner. No tests use them yet; the following patches in the
series add the tests.

[Severity: Medium]
Does net/can also need a TEST_INCLUDES line here?

j1939_lib.sh sources ../lib.sh, and net/lib.sh in turn sources
lib/sh/defer.sh. net/can/Makefile does not declare either file for
installation.

net/lib.sh is only installed through TEST_FILES in net/Makefile. The top
level selftests Makefile only pulls in the net lib dependency when TARGETS
contains net, drivers/net or drivers/net/hw:

tools/testing/selftests/Makefile:
    ifneq ($(filter net drivers/net drivers/net/hw,$(TARGETS)),)

With make TARGETS=net/can install, or when net/can is packaged on its own,
would every J1939 wrapper added later in the series (test_j1939_base.sh,
_opts, _addr, _wire, _multi) fail at the source line? They would then run
with ksft_skip, check_err, log_test, tests_run and EXIT_STATUS undefined.

net/mptcp/Makefile handles the same dependency with:

    TEST_INCLUDES := ../lib.sh $(wildcard ../lib/sh/*.sh)

test_raw_filter.sh already has a similar gap. This patch, though, adds a
new shared library that the following tests depend on, and the gap is
still there at the end of the series.

[Severity: Low]
On the real CAN path (CANIF not vcan*), setup() reprograms an existing
interface to $BITRATE. It does not save the previous bittiming. cleanup()
only undoes brought_up and created.

Does this leave the interface at 250 kbit/s after the test? The same
question applies when the following ip link set ... up fails and setup()
exits with brought_up=0.

Bittiming survives down/up, so the next user of the interface would bring
it up at the new rate. That seems to contradict the comment above about
not disturbing a pre-existing interface. test_raw_filter.sh behaves the
same way.

[Severity: Low]
cleanup() never calls exit. In bash, when the INT or TERM trap returns,
the script carries on with the next command.

If the signal arrives between setup and tests_run, could the test binary
still run against the vcan that cleanup() just deleted? J1939_SETUP_IFINDEX
would fail and log_test would report a FAIL.

If the signal arrives while the binary is running, log_test and
exit $EXIT_STATUS still run after the trap returns, and the EXIT trap then
calls cleanup() a second time.

bash also runs the EXIT trap on these signals. Would trap cleanup EXIT be
enough on its own, as in test_raw_filter.sh?

[Severity: Medium]
Can send_recv_verify() catch a delivery that is longer than len?

rx_buf is exactly len bytes, and recv_timeout() calls recv(s, buf, len, 0).
For an oversized datagram, j1939_sk_recvmsg() does:

net/can/j1939/socket.c:j1939_sk_recvmsg() {
    ...
	if (size < skb->len)
		msg->msg_flags |= MSG_TRUNC;
	else
		size = skb->len;
    ...
	return size;
}

So recv() returns len and the MSG_TRUNC indication is lost. An over-long
delivery, for example from a TP/ETP reassembly regression that adds
padding bytes, would pass both the == (int)len check and the memcmp() over
the prefix.

Later in the series, test_j1939_base.c and test_j1939_addr.c use this
helper to check payload integrity at the transport size boundaries.

Passing MSG_TRUNC as an input flag won't work, because j1939_sk_recvmsg()
returns -EINVAL for any flag other than MSG_DONTWAIT, MSG_ERRQUEUE and
MSG_CMSG_COMPAT. Would a len + 1 receive buffer, or recvmsg() with a check
of msg_flags, work instead?
