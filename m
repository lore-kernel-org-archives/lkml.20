Thanks for confirming!  Ah, so get_file_active() is good here, cheers. 
I'll repost as a 2-part series to first include this in vmwgfx and 
second add the anNULL.

FWIW aside, I re-read this, and there does appear to be a ref held 
(dma_buf_export() has just happened, and dma_buf_fd() generated) so 
dmabuf->file is stable at that point.

Yep, on it.

Many thanks,
