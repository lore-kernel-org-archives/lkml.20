We talked back then about kmscon.  It doesn't look to me to be a
suitable replacement for the Linux console yet, at least for me anyway,
for quite a few reasons.

I've just submitted a series of patches to a few mailing lists and
several people, including yourself.

The main reason I don't like kmscon (yet) is that it has no key bindings
<Alt>-<Fn> to switch to a specific VT (or something analogous).  This
would make it unusable for my current work flow, where I have 20 tty's
running, and switch between them frequently using <Alt>-<Fn> or
<Shift>-<Alt>-<Fn>.

Even though kmscon has been included in some distributions (including
Fedora), I have failed to find any user reviews of it in a web search.
In particular, I'm looking for somebody writing something like "I've
been using kmscon for <n> weeks, and I find it delightful.".
