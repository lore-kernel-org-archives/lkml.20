This series is a continuation of Nicolas Frattaroli's series, that does
major cleanups in the Mediatek UFS driver code and dt-bindings and adds
the support for the MT8196 SoC and its variants (MT8894 SoC).
The new revisions of the series (v10 and later) take into account the
remaining peer reviews and issues reports for v9.

First, it fixes several build and check issues: kernel test report build
report [1], patch per patch compilations.

Second, regarding the opened issues in v9 on the dt-bindings patches
2 ("dt-bindings: ufs: mediatek,ufs: Complete the binding") and 3
("dt-bindings: ufs: mediatek,ufs: Add mt8196 variant") [2],
this revision has two major changes to address them:
1) It renames all the clock names starting with ufs_ prefix and the one
that was named "ufs". No driver changes is needed for those because
they are not explicitely used by their names. The ufs_sel and ufs_fde
clocks in the driver were not renamed because they are not present 
in the dt-bindings (not anymore for the ufs_sel).
The devicetree patches for MT8195 SoC dtsi and the Mediatek Genio
1200-EVK and Radxa NIO-12L boards will be sent in a separate series to
address the dtbs_check warnings caused by the changes.
2) It drops the addition of all crypto and ufs_sel clocks, as it seems the
most likely and best solution to [2] after investigating on them and
what they are used for ([3]).

The Reviewed-by and Acked-by trailers, got by the patches 2 and 3 in
previous series revisions (v9 and earlier), were dropped so these
changes can be reviewed again. 

This new revision is based on linux-next kernel tree (tag:
next-20260930) and has been tested on Mediatek Genio 5100 Pro board
that integrates a MT8894 SoC (MT8196 variant).

Original Nicolas Frattaroli's cover letter:

In this series, the existing MediaTek UFS binding is expanded and
completed to correctly describe not just the existing compatibles, but
also to introduce a new compatible in the from of the MT8196 SoC.

The resets, which until now were completely absent from both the UFS
host controller binding and the UFS PHY binding, are introduced to both.
This also means the driver's undocumented and, in mainline, unused reset
logic is reworked. In particular, the PHY reset is no longer a reset of
the host controller node, but of the PHY node.

This means the host controller can reset the PHY through the common PHY
framework.

The resets remain optional.

Additionally, a massive number of driver cleanups are introduced. These
were prompted by me inspecting the driver more closely as I was
adjusting it to correspond to the binding.

The driver still implements vendor properties that are undocumented in
the binding. I did not touch most of those, as I neither want to
convince the bindings maintainers that they are needed without knowing
precisely what they're for, nor do I want to argue with the driver
authors when removing them.

Due to the "Marie Kondo with a chainsaw" nature of the driver cleanup
patches, I humbly request that reviewers do not comment on displeasing
code they see in the context portion of a patch before they've read the
whole patch series, as that displeasing code may in fact be reworked in
a subsequent patch of this series. Please keep comments focused on the
changed lines of the diff; I know there's more that can be done, but it
doesn't necessarily need to be part of this series.

- driver: get and enable/disable the aforementioned avdd supplies.

  build due to an unrelated OPP core change that was merged with no
  build testing. I can't use next-20251022 either, as that lacks the
  recent mediatek UFS changes. It is what it is.
