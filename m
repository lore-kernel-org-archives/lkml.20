That's incorrect, you should have two clocks in DT if the block has two
even if they have a shared gate.

The CCF is still the right way to do it, especially since CCK0/1 can be
exported to other devices. I don't believe you need to actually have a
reference in DT to do this though, plenty of "real" clock controllers
have only one input clock and hang a whole tree with multiple layers off
that.
Down below I mentioned this under "ouroboros devices", I think this kind
of ability to chose which clock a channel uses is a fairly normal thing
to do in IIO land, I just dunno what the preferred mechanism is - I just
know that it is not referencing yourself (probably it's some sort of
property that you put in a channel node that says 'blah-clock =3D "cck0"',
but better that the IIO folks answer.

One thing to note there is that you retrofitted the backends onto that
device, and the original design here is much older (it's a text
binding).

Yeah, pretty sure this is wrong (backwards). The backend is the thing
that gets data from an ADC not the ADC.
