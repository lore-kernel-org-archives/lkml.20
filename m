Hi Mathieu,

Gentle ping on this series: it makes rproc_free_vring() reset freed
vring entries to FW_RSC_ADDR_ANY, guards the error-path stop() call
in rproc_start() against implementations without stop(), rolls a
failed attach back with detach() when available, and releases the
resources and power references left behind by a failed recovery.

Happy to provide anything else you need.

Thanks,
Yonghao
