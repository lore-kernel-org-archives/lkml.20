Here MADV_HUGEPAGE cannot directly apply on this case: perf allocates
the AUX pages during mmap, while TRBE accesses them through a separate
kernel vmap() mapping.

MADV_HUGEPAGE is applied after mmap, but a preference (or flag) would
need to be specified before the AUX mmap.

Yeah, Neoverse V3 was improved to have two entries. Even so, I was told
it still suffers from TLB misses, so still needs a large mapping
granule.

The kernel already takes the PERF_PMU_CAP_AUX_PREFER_LARGE flag from a
PMU; a preferred maximum order would let the driver give it a bounded
value.

I do not intend to hard-code or guess a preference for a particular CPU
variant. We can map TRBE or SPE buffer at PMD granularity. On a 4
KiB-page system, PMD_ORDER is order 9, or 2 MiB. Requesting a larger
contiguous chunk cannot increase the mapping granule, so I would cap the
preference there. It remains a preference: perf can fall back to smaller
orders when allocation fails.

Exposing the preference to userspace also seems problematic. Users
generally lack the hardware details needed to choose an appropriate
value. Even if tools provide a default, the same policy would need to
be duplicated across perf, simpleperf, and proprietary tools. I don't
think userspace tools are the right place for this policy.

Thanks,
Leo
