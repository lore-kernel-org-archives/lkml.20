Hey Linus,

/* Summary */

This contains last fixes for the current development cycle:

- Fix a range of use-after-frees during rcu pathwalk caused by non-rcu
  frees. Whatever ->permission(), ->d_revalidate(), ->get_link(),
  ->d_hash() and ->d_compare() read in rcu mode has to be freed after a
  grace period. umount(2) hides most of it because namespace_unlock()
  waits for one, but a chdir() out of a lazily unmounted directory or
  the close() of the last file on it drops the last reference without.

  * ext4_get_link() reads the sbi and the extent status counters for a
    symlink stored in a data block. Both are freed after a grace period
    now.

  * The unicode map of casefolded ext4, f2fs and tmpfs was freed under
    generic_ci_d_hash() and generic_ci_d_compare().

  * ntfs3 with nocase freed its sbi and mount options under its dentry
    hash and compare. A remount freed the old options right away too.

  * eventfs freed an eventfs_inode after an SRCU grace period only
    while tracefs_d_revalidate() reads it under rcu_read_lock().

  * afs and 9p are only saved by the grace period their private bdi
    gets in bdi_unregister(). They stop depending on it.

  * create_ipc_ns() leaked the mqueue mount and its superblock on a
    late failure. A long-term mount needs kern_unmount().

- Don't let idle threads pin the initramfs. The idle threads of the
  secondary cpus are forked from PID 1 with a private copy of its
  fs_struct, aren't on the task list so pivot_root() never moves them
  and never exit. So the initramfs stayed pinned forever on every
  machine with more than one cpu, 70 to 150 MB in the reports. They
  share init_fs now like init_task does.

- A mount that copy_tree() leaves out can't take over a lock.
  copy_tree() drops mounts of mount namespace files from the copies it
  makes for unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) and propagation without looking at
  MNT_LOCKED. So root in a user namespace could bind a child's
  /proc/<pid>/ns/mnt beneath a locked cover, let it take the lock over,
  unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) and read the file. copy_tree() refuses with
  EPERM now and the move beneath a locked mount is refused up front.

- Revert "namei: don't reveal overmounted entries in refwalk" from the
  rc7 fixes. The bug class is bigger than that patch.

- namei: lookup_fast_for_open() checked ->d_inode while
  traverse_mounts() checks the type in d_flags, which is set second, so
  a refwalk racing the instantiation could fail an O_CREAT open with
  ENOENT. Use d_is_negative() in both places.

- Drop the smp_mb()s in mntput_no_expire_slowpath() and do_umount()
  that mnt_get_count()'s own barrier made redundant.

- fsnotify: a mark added while fsnotify_destroy_marks() walks the
  connector could be missed and the connector detached, so an fdinfo
  read called igrab(NULL). New marks are refused during teardown.

- pipe: a failed second fasync enable on an O_RDWR FIFO removed the
  existing reader entry and cleared FASYNC while the writer entry
  stayed, a use-after-free in send_sigio() later.

- watch_queue: post_one_notification() could see nr_notes before the
  note pool behind it and dereference a NULL array. An unprivileged
  user can trigger that with a key watch. Publish nr_notes last.

- pid_namespace: zap_pid_ns_processes() waits without bound for a
  tracer outside the namespace to reap its zombies and neither wait
  was freezable, so every suspend attempt failed.

- exit: is_child_subreaper and has_child_subreaper shared a word with
  other bitfields written without a common lock, so racing prctl()s
  lost a bit. They are separate bools now.

- autofs: a notification write that failed on a pipe the daemon had
  already replaced put the superblock into catatonic mode again and
  closed the replacement. Only do that for the current pipe.

- ovl: reject a lowerdir ending with an unescaped backslash with EINVAL
  instead of a confusing ENOENT later.

- ocfs2/dlm: take dlm_reco_state_lock when the debugfs state file walks
  the recovery participant list.

- samples/pidfd: fix the userprogs typo that kept pidfd-metadata from
  being built.
