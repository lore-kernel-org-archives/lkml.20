Brilliant design.
By using the global ksm_scan.seqnr as a unified time base, this patch eliminates
the out-of-sync problem of the original per-page skip counters.

It guarantees that any two pages will be processed in the same scan at least once
every 8 scans — the least common multiple of all scan periods — which completely
resolves the permanent de-duplication failure.

Admittedly, this comes at the cost of shrinking the longest scan interval from 9
to 8 scans, raising the scan frequency for aged pages by roughly 12.5%. But I
believe this is a very reasonable trade-off for correctness. So

Besides, can we add a extra description about new smart_scan algorithm that we
missed in Documentation/mm/ksm.rst?
