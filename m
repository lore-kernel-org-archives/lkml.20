In that case, perhaps the simplest approach is to leave this issue out
of this series and fix the Intel PT mutual exclusion issue separately?

Also, once that issue is fixed, filtering out pmu->global_status_rsvd
bits feels mostly defensive anyway, and I'm not sure it solves any
additional problem by itself.
