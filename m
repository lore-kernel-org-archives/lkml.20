Sure, as long as I'm not responsible for those :)

I think HID is just the transport layer (like USB, I2C, SPI, etc...) so
it shouldn't count as one of the additional subsystems to MFD.

I apply the following DSDT to the VM that is running the test device:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bentiss/gitlab-kernel-ci/-/blob/master/VM/0004-Add-CP2112-SSDT-override.patch?ref_type=heads#L51

Basically, this converts the CP2112 from being a simple USB device to a
known I2C + GPIO device by the ACPI table, and where I can then attach
another I2C child device (Device (TPD0) in the DSDT).
It's the same than adding a device tree to a platform where the I2C bus
is connected to a USB bus but is soldered on the chip.

My only constraint here is that the children of the MFD node properly
have the fwnode support. See commit c0be05f68a21 ("HID: cp2112: Add
fwnode support") for when this was added upstream.

I would assume MFD correctly sets fwnodes for the children devices it
handles, and hopefully it's working fine with ACPI as well.

Cheers,
Benjamin
