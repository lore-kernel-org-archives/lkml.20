That's my understanding too.

For host state clobbering behavior, we cares about the values of the host (VMX
root mode) after SEAMRET.

When there is a control/field for "load host state from host-state area", I
think there are two cases: 
- If there is the corresponding control/field for "load guest state from
  guest-state area", the TDX module could leverage it.
- If there is no such corresponding control/field for "load guest state from
  guest-state area", the TDX module could do it in software way to mimic it.

So from the view of the VMM, it can have the aligned behavior on host state
clobbering behavior.
