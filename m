> selftests/bpf: Cover the low-32 link for zero-extending movs

TL;DR:
- Selftest comment calls the mixed-kind no-sync case unsound, but the program
  is safe; it is only lost precision
- Commit message says "Twelve" programs, but there are thirteen

The changelog says "Twelve programs", but the list below it has thirteen
bullets, and the patch adds thirteen programs:

zext_mov_narrow_src, zext_sync_makes_member_const,
zext_contradiction_keeps_range_sane, zext_narrow_dst_keeps_base,
zext_u32_src_is_full_link, zext_self_mov_no_link, zext_chain_drops_link,
zext_no_sync_between_mixed_kinds, zext_no_sync_from_subreg_base,
zext_sync_between_two_subregs, zext_sync_keeps_narrower_member,
zext_unlinked_path_stays_reachable and zext_mov_breaks_linked_src.

The count looks like it was not updated when
zext_contradiction_keeps_range_sane was added.  It is the last bullet, but the
third program in the file.  Should "Twelve" be "Thirteen"?

                ^^^^

This isn't a bug, but is the comment accurate for this direction?  It says
narrowing r8 "says nothing about r7", and the asm comment says the narrowing
"must not propagate to r7".

r8 is a BPF_REG_LINK_FULL member, so r8 == r6 + 3 over all 64 bits.  That
relation inverts exactly, so knowing r8 pins the base, and r7 == (u32)(r8 - 3)
follows.

In this program the fall-through of "if r8 != 3 goto 1f" forces r6 == 0, so
r7 == 0, "if w7 == 0 goto 1f" is always taken, and "r0 /= 0" cannot be reached
at runtime.  The program is safe.  The verifier rejects it only because
sync_linked_regs() skips every pair with differing kinds:

    if (reg->link_kind && known_reg->link_kind &&
        reg->link_kind != known_reg->link_kind)
            continue;

That check exists for the other direction, a ZEXT known_reg against a FULL
member (scalars_alu32_alu64_cross_type), where the 32-bit wrap really does
break the relation.  If the differencing arm ran for known=r8 (FULL, delta 3)
and reg=r7 (ZEXT, delta 0), it would compute r8 + (0 - 3) and then
zext_32_to_64(), which gives exactly (u32)(r8 - 3).  That is sound.

So this test pins a deliberate loss of precision, not a soundness requirement,
but the comment presents it as unsound.  The text is unchanged at the tip of
the series.  Someone who later makes the verifier propagate FULL -> ZEXT will
see this test fail, and the comment will suggest the improvement is wrong.

zext_chain_drops_link and zext_mov_breaks_linked_src also reject runtime-safe
programs, but their comments say the link is dropped by rule.  Could this one
be worded the same way, for example "sync_linked_regs() declines mixed kinds
even where, as here, the relation would hold"?
