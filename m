The request and response payload formats are specific to each CoCo
backend. Since iommufd treats the payloads as opaque and does not
validate their contents, what would documenting those formats here
achieve?

The limited validation is intended to prevent this from becoming a
general-purpose multiplexer ioctl. It restricts the ioctl to a defined
set of guest-initiated operations that the host forwards to the
firmware. The path is essentially:

guest -> vmexit -> VMM -> iommufd ioctl -> TSM backend -> firmware

That would require documenting a significant amount of backend-specific
detail in iommufd. Could we instead require each TSM backend's
guest_request callback to document its request and response formats?

With VFIO PCI BARs backed by guest_memfd, the VMM can validate that the
IPA and PA values provided by the guest belong to the VFIO device. We
previously also used this operation to ask the CoCo TSM backend to map
the device memory (the BAR regions). I have removed this operation from
the latest series because that responsibility is now split between the
VMM and guest_memfd. TDX and SNP still need to be updated accordingly.

CCA uses RHI. The RHI reaches the VMM, which issues the ioctl to
complete the request.

These objects are cached by the hypervisor. For CCA, they include the
certificate, measurement, interface report, and VCA. They are read in
response to guest requests. The requests reach the VMM through an
RHI, and the VMM issues the ioctl to read the requested object. REGEN
refreshes the objects/evidence at the guest's request.

I had hoped we could use it, but I could not find an easy way to
integrate the two. We need a simple way to read these evidence objects
into userspace. I am not yet sure whether evidence-get can be used for
that, since it does more than simply read the objects; it also updates
evidence.generation, among other things.

We get final callback via

vdev->viommu->ops->vdevice_tsm_req

Are you suggesting one ioctl per each guest request ops?
