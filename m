Understood, we will cover both configurations going forward.

Ok. With the resume moved to the BSG entry point this is
resolved naturally: smp_execute_task_sg() uses get_noresume() (void
return, nothing to check), and the resume_and_get() at the callsite
checks its result.

Yes, that works and is cleaner:

@@ smp_execute_task_sg()
-	pm_runtime_get_sync(ha->dev);
+	/*
+	 * Non-blocking: a sync resume here would deadlock against
+	 * sas_drain_work() during HA resume.
+	 */
+	pm_runtime_get_noresume(ha->dev);
  	...
-	pm_runtime_put_sync(ha->dev);
+	pm_runtime_put(ha->dev);

@@ sas_smp_handler()
+	/*
+	 * The host may have autosuspended. This is the only
+	 * smp_execute_task_sg() caller which can find it suspended,
+	 * so resume it here.
+	 */
+	ret = pm_runtime_resume_and_get(dev->port->ha->dev);
+	if (ret)
+		goto out;
+
  	ret = smp_execute_task_sg(dev, job->request_payload.sg_list,
  			job->reply_payload.sg_list);
+
+	pm_runtime_put(dev->port->ha->dev);

The get_noresume() is kept for the discovery path.  Discovery work
normally runs inside an event worker's PM reference, taken at
sas_notify_port_event() notify time and held until the handler has
flushed the disco queue.  The exception is sas_rediscover_ex_phy(),
which requeues DISCE_REVALIDATE_DOMAIN from within the revalidation
worker itself: flush_workqueue() does not wait for work items queued
during execution, so that chained revalidation runs with no outer PM
reference and its SMP could race autosuspend.

We confirmed this race by fault injection on expander-attached SATA:
with the usage hold removed, the host autosuspended while the chained
revalidation was issuing its SMP and the command timed out against
the suspending host.  With the get_noresume() in place, the same test
shows the suspend attempt being caught by the existing usage check in
_suspend_v3_hw() ("PM suspend: host status cannot be suspended") and
aborted, so the revalidation completes with the host active.

For the original deadlock, the SMP which the resume path itself
issues (sas_ata_hard_reset() -> sas_phy_reset() ->
sas_smp_phy_control()) now completes normally during HA resume, and
BSG SMP queries against an autosuspended host resume it correctly.

Right, the check is gone entirely with this restructure.

Thanks for the guidance.  I'll send v4.

Thanks,
