Taking just the compressed case...
If there are capacity signals etc I'm not sure I'd want to have to paravirtualize
those. Plus I really don't fancy making a single compressed device provide memory
into multiple hosts. That's a whole new level of paravirtualization of noisy
neighbours.  Ma! Someone else wrote really uncompressible memory and now there
is none left for me.

Hmm. That is potentially ugly. But I guess a problem for any accelerator.
If they are firmware first not too bad as it's just normal memory error
reporting so we create a cper in the host with the GPA and send it on
it's merry way.

We'd lie (trap / emulate) the device decoder and probably the topology so that
what you see matches up and device provided DPAs will translate to GPAs.
I forget if that bit is in this patch set or not.

Hmm. We may get a way to do that at somepoint but so far it's pretty
simple so I'd argue only a few things need to look different in the
guest to what they do in the host.

Agreed.
