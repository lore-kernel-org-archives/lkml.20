I don't think so, it's the other direction. That pattern is the pair
on reset_state.reset, and it isn't in question. The pair on
power_state, as I see it, runs the other way: the target's last
accesses to reset_state are its reads of the payload and its clear of
the flag in pkvm_reset_vcpu(), and the next CPU_ON's accesses are
stores. Release on OFF, acquire on the cmpxchg: unlock then lock, with
power_state as the lock word. The winner takes it with the cmpxchg,
hands it to the target through reset, and the target gives it up at
CPU_OFF. Nothing is published. What I was after is the winner's stores
being ordered after the target's reads and its clear.

Yes. The target's first __kvm_vcpu_run hypercall after the host's
kvm_psci_vcpu_on() has woken it. handle___kvm_vcpu_run() reads
power_state as ON_PENDING and calls pkvm_reset_vcpu() before entering
the guest.

The target's own accesses at its reset, its reads of the payload and
its clear of the flag. You're right that the hardware orders them:
__kvm_vcpu_run() runs dsb(nsh) before it restores the guest's state,
and since R24234 the NSH is only a TLBI/IC scope, so that DSB orders
the target's accesses before OFF for every PE. My reasoning for the
release and the acquire was that the protocol shouldn't rest on a
barrier that is there for the translation regime, that nothing
documents as ordering EL2 state for other CPUs, and that the LKMM,
having no dsb(), can't see: under the model the target's accesses and
the next winner's are unordered without them. Would you rather rely on
the world switch and say so at that dsb(nsh)?

I'd actually done that earlier.

The flag, under the LKMM (herd7 7.58 with mainline's tools/memory-model):

        C CPU_OFF-flag

        (*
         * P0, the target: its reset clears reset_state.reset, its
         * CPU_OFF stores power_state = OFF. P1, the next CPU_ON:
         * cmpxchg(OFF -> ON_PENDING), then a release of reset.
         * OFF=0 ON=1 ON_PENDING=2.
         *)

        {
                power_state = 1;
                reset = 1;
        }

        P0(int *power_state, int *reset)
        {
                *reset = 0;
                WRITE_ONCE(*power_state, 0);
        }

        P1(int *power_state, int *reset)
        {
                int r1;

                r1 = cmpxchg_relaxed(power_state, 0, 2);
                if (r1 == 0)
                        smp_store_release(reset, 1);
        }

        exists (1:r1=0 /\ reset=0)

As written: Sometimes, and a data race. With smp_store_release() for
the OFF store: Never. CPU_OFF doesn't touch reset_state, but its OFF
store is what a CPU_ON takes with the cmpxchg, so it seemed to me the
store the target's accesses should be ordered before.

Agreed, it reads as if the acquire ordered earlier accesses. For v4:

        /*
         * vCPUs race to power on the same target. The acquire orders the
         * writes below after the cmpxchg's read of OFF, and with the release
         * of OFF in pvm_psci_vcpu_off() that puts them after the target's
         * reads and clear of reset_state in pkvm_reset_vcpu().
         */

The other direction, the payload:

        C CPU_ON-payload

        (*
         * P0, the target: its reset reads reset_state.pc, its CPU_OFF
         * stores OFF with a release. P1, the next CPU_ON:
         * cmpxchg(OFF -> ON_PENDING), then a plain store to pc.
         * OFF=0 ON=1 ON_PENDING=2.
         *)

        {
                power_state = 1;
                pc = 0;
        }

        P0(int *power_state, int *pc)
        {
                int r0;

                r0 = *pc;
                smp_store_release(power_state, 0);
        }

        P1(int *power_state, int *pc)
        {
                int r1;

                r1 = cmpxchg_relaxed(power_state, 0, 2);
                if (r1 == 0)
                        *pc = 1;
        }

        exists (1:r1=0 /\ 0:r0=1)

As written: Sometimes, and a data race. With cmpxchg_acquire(): Never.
Those two are what's behind the release (v3) and the acquire (v4). The
rollback's ON_PENDING -> OFF cmpxchg in handle_pvm_entry_hvc64() has
the same pattern on the source side, so v4 makes it a release too.

My head is spinning now :)
