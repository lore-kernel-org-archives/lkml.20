"nfsd: fail a LAYOUTGET in progress when the layout lease is broken"
fails a LAYOUTGET whose layout stateid has no layouts yet when the lease
is broken, so that no layout is handed out after the break without a
recall. Since "nfsd: answer NFS4ERR_DELAY instead of waiting for a
layout recall", a WRITE through the metadata server that meets a layout
of its own client gets NFS4ERR_DELAY, and the Linux client resends it
every 0.1 seconds; a resend breaks the lease of any LAYOUTGET that the
same client has in progress. A client that writes through the metadata
server while it does I/O through a layout of the same file, as the Linux
client does for O_DIRECT writes that are not aligned to a page, then
gets NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT for LAYOUTGET after LAYOUTGET, and waits up
to 15 seconds between them.

When the break comes from a request of the client that holds the layout
stateid, nfsd4_break_file_layout() notes that the break met a LAYOUTGET
in progress and when the break times out (fl_break_time), and
nfsd4_insert_layout() recalls the layout as soon as it adds it. The
LAYOUTGET succeeds and the client is asked for the layout back at once.
nfsd4_layout_breaker_is_holder() finds the client of the breaker as
nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() does for delegations. A break by another
client or by a local process fails the LAYOUTGET as before, and the
conflicting operation goes ahead without waiting for a recall, unless a
break by the holder came first. The new case is traced as
nfsd_layout_break_pending.

A LAYOUTGET that would add its layout after the break has timed out
fails as before, whether or not the timeout has been noticed yet:
time_out_leases() notices it only when another lease operation on the
file comes, and a layout added in between would be recalled when it is
already due and have its client fenced if that operation comes before
the layout is back. When the timeout is noticed first,
nfsd4_layout_lm_breaker_timedout() marks the layout stateid recalled, so
that the LAYOUTGET fails. A layout added shortly before the break times
out is recalled with what is left of fs.lease-break-time, and its client
is fenced if it does not return the layout by then, where the LAYOUTGET
failed before this patch. With the default of 45 seconds that takes a
LAYOUTGET that has been in progress for most of that time.

The recall is queued before the LAYOUTGET reply is sent and can reach
the client first; a client that answers NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT then
would have its layout thrown away while it uses it. The resent recall of
"nfsd: resend a layout recall once before trusting NOMATCHING_LAYOUT"
and the referring call that CB_LAYOUTRECALL carries since "nfsd: send a
referring call with CB_LAYOUTRECALL" cover that, for a client that takes
the reply in within about three seconds or holds the recall back, which
is why this comes after them.

One client writing 1 MiB blocks with O_DIRECT through its block layout
and 512 bytes at the middle of a page through the metadata server to the
same file, for 30 seconds: before this patch 54, 54 and 51 of the 1 MiB
writes were done in three runs, as the LAYOUTGETs failed and the client
backed off; with it 244, 249 and 241, with no 1 MiB block lost. The 512
byte writes went from 5054, 4992 and 5072 to 1309, 1117 and 1415: the
client now holds a layout most of the time, and such a WRITE meets it
and gets NFS4ERR_DELAY. The same change without the two patches above
lost 85 of 600, 87 of 584 and 79 of 600 blocks.

With fs.lease-break-time at one second and a test-only delay before
nfsd4_insert_layout(), a 512 byte write through the metadata server 0.3
seconds into the LAYOUTGET broke the lease and was resent every 0.1
seconds; the first resend after the break timed out came 37 to 44 ms
after it. A layout added 25 to 29 ms before the break timed out was
recalled at once and returned in each of five runs, without fencing.
LAYOUTGETs that would add their layout about 17 or 30 ms after the break
had timed out, before that resend, failed with NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT in
each of five runs at each offset. With the test of the deadline taken
out, they handed the layout out. At 17 ms the client returned it before
the resend in each of five runs, and nothing was fenced; at 30 ms the
resend timed the break out while the client still held the layout, and
had it fenced, in four of five, and came first in the fifth.

With a test-only delay of three seconds and a local write on the server
that breaks the lease during that delay and goes ahead one second later,
the LAYOUTGET fails with NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT with this patch, as
without it, in each of three runs: a local process is not the holder, so
this patch leaves that case alone. With another client breaking the
lease, as in the test of "nfsd: resend a layout recall once before
trusting NOMATCHING_LAYOUT" without the delay, the 1 MiB writes went on
with the whole series as without it: 600 blocks in each of three runs of
30 seconds, as in each of six without the series, and no recall overtook
a reply.

No Fixes: tag, as "nfsd: fail a LAYOUTGET in progress when the layout
lease is broken" is not upstream yet. Where that patch is backported,
this one is needed too, but only together with the two patches before
it, so only where "NFSD: Send referring calls with CB_RECALL" and its
series are, and not before v7.1.
