No, that is not correct. The function handles both OP_MEM_DELEGATED and
OP_MEM_UNDELEGATED. In the former case, we explicitly "delegate" the
pages before donating. The "UNDELEGATED" case doesn't need to do that
extra step.

Yep, agree. We can rejec the CONDITIONAL ones.

As above, that check is additionally preparing the memory for RMM
consumption.

Ack, we can reject the CONDITIONAL ones.
