Hi Paul,

Gonna admit I was wrong on this one. It is entirely possible to make
a generic kfunc interface for this, without it turning into an ioctl
style multiplexer either. Honestly I think it's the better design anyway.
Just took a month of staring at the code before the realization
hit me.

Since it's been about a month since the original submission, my plan is
to send a revised version based on generic kfuncs in
security/bpf_lsm_kfuncs.c, which expose no LSM-specific interface:

  bpf_lsm_policy_from_fd(fd, flags)                                   KF_ACQUIRE | KF_RET_NULL | KF_SLEEPABLE
  bpf_lsm_policy_acquire(struct lsm_policy_object *)                  KF_ACQUIRE | KF_RCU | KF_RET_NULL
  bpf_lsm_policy_release(struct lsm_policy_object *)                  KF_RELEASE
  bpf_lsm_policy_apply_bprm(struct lsm_policy_object *, bprm, flags)  KF_SLEEPABLE

  struct lsm_policy_object {  /* initialized in LSM object structs */
          u64 lsmid;
          u32 type;
  };

I know I said I'd hold off on revisions until your review, so if
you're already reviewing the current set (or still plan to), just
say so and I'll sit on it. Otherwise I'd rather send the new version
than have you waste time on a stale patchset, or on making a point
you've already convinced me of.

This generic design is better, and I've already experimented with
implementing the same hooks/kfuncs for AppArmor / SELinux exec-time
transitions (possible future patchsets?). This would allow writing
LSM-agnostic BPF programs (like liblsm).

Thank you so much for your feedback Paul.

Mickäel,

I think this should address your concerns about the multiplexer
design, this avoids it handily by making the rulesets/"policy object"
self-identifying so there's no need for an opcode/lsmid parameter.
There's a small lsm_policy_struct that gets embedded in the ruleset
with the lsmid already initialized, and then the original ruleset
is retrieved via container_of.

Otherwise, the semantics of the API, the flags, and implementation
are identical to this set, with the exception that ruleset
references can be taken under RCU.

Thank you for both your time and feedback,
Justin
