From: Pengfei Li <lipengfei28@xiaomi.com>

Hi Steven, Masami, all,

This is v5 of the ftrace stackmap series, sent as a new thread.

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260616064119.438063-1-lipengfei28@xiaomi.com/

The series adds stack trace deduplication to ftrace. When the
'stackmap' option is enabled alongside 'stacktrace', the ring buffer
stores a 4-byte stack_id instead of a full kernel stack trace, and the
full stacks are exported once via tracefs (stack_map / stack_map_bin).

Rebased onto v7.2-rc4 (4539944e5151).

v5 is the cleanups Steven asked for on v4, five issues I found myself,
and one behaviour change: reset is simplified the way Steven suggested
(details below). No functional change to the dedup algorithm itself.

Mathieu: patch 1 is the lock-free map. The memory ordering there
(entry->val release/acquire publishing the element payload, key only
under READ_ONCE, and resetting + synchronize_rcu() for teardown) is
the part I would most like a second pair of eyes on.

Motivation
==========

The target use case is long-duration, from-boot kernel tracing where
the same stacks recur enormously often and the bottleneck is ring
buffer space, not CPU.

Concretely: tracing the slab allocator from boot for hours to study
memory aging and to catch the allocation backtraces behind a usage
peak. With a stacktrace trigger on the slab tracepoints, every event
today carries a full kernel stack (~80-160 bytes). On a fixed-size
ring buffer that bounds how far back in time the trace reaches: the
buffer wraps in seconds to minutes and the early-boot history -- the
part we care about -- is overwritten before it can be consumed.

In this workload the set of distinct stacks is small and highly
repetitive, so storing a 4-byte stack_id per event and the full stack
only once dramatically increases the time span a given buffer covers.
The intended operating model is exactly the low-overhead one ftrace is
good at: let the trace run for a long time producing a comparatively
small, dense log, then resolve stack_ids offline (cat stack_map, or
parse stack_map_bin with the included tool) during analysis.

This is complementary to, not a replacement for, the existing full
stack recording: deep stacks and the early pre-init window still fall
back to full stacks (see below).

Effect on retention
====================

Same fixed per-CPU buffer, slab allocation workload with a shallow
kernel stack (kmem_cache_alloc), stackmap OFF vs ON:

                  retained events   bytes/event   time span
  stackmap OFF        645,068          ~104 B        15.0 s
  stackmap ON       1,397,741           ~48 B        27.7 s
                     2.17x             2.17x          1.85x

The buffer holds ~2.17x more events and reaches ~1.85x further back in
time for the same memory. The win grows with stack depth and with how
repetitive the stacks are; for deep, highly-repeated stacks the
per-event size approaches the 4-byte stack_id plus event header.

Changes since v4
================

From Steven's review of v4:
  - ftrace_stackmap_create() uses vcalloc() for both the hash table
    and the element pool instead of vzalloc(size * n).
  - ftrace_stackmap_create() error handling collapsed into a single
    goto-fail ladder, freeing in reverse allocation order.
  - Dropped the anonymous block in ftrace_stackmap_reset(); the cpu
    iterator is declared at function scope.
  - struct ftrace_stackmap_bin_entry grew a u64 ips[] flexible array
    member, and stackmap_bin_open() now uses struct_size(e, ips, nr)
    and writes through e->ips. The on-disk byte layout is unchanged,
    so the binary format is not affected.
  - Undid a few 80-column line wraps in the tracefs init path that
    were hurting readability.

reset semantics -- the one behaviour change in v5:
  - Steven pointed out on the v4 thread [1] that reset was stricter
    than it needs to be. v5 drops both parts of that strictness:
    reset no longer returns -EBUSY when tracing is on, and it no
    longer clears the ring buffer. It now clears the map and nothing
    else, which also let the tracer_tracing_is_on() check, the
    trace_types_lock section and the snapshot-buffer handling go away
    (patch 1 is 56 lines shorter as a result).

    I had replied that I would do this as a follow-up rather than hold
    this respin. On reflection there is no reason to ship the stricter
    version first, so it is folded in here instead.

    The consequence is that a trace can still contain <stack_id N>
    records after a reset. Such an id either has no entry in
    stack_map, or -- once tracing continues and the slot is reused --
    resolves to an unrelated stack. That is misleading userspace
    output, not corruption: the map is still guarded by the resetting
    flag plus synchronize_rcu(), and reset frees nothing, it only
    memsets storage the map still owns. This is spelled out in the
    ftrace_stackmap_reset() kernel-doc and in ftrace-stackmap.rst.

    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260821235129.078dd489@fedora/

Issues found locally since v4:
  - The IS_ERR() branch of the stackmap init path modified
    global_trace.trace_flags without trace_types_lock, racing
    set_tracer_flag(). It now goes through the same
    stackmap_mark_init_failed() helper as the other failure path.
  - TRACE_STACK_ID was not handled in print_graph_function_flags(),
    so with current_tracer=function_graph a stack_id event fell
    through to print_graph_comment() instead of being punted to its
    own printer like TRACE_STACK. Now handled alongside TRACE_STACK.
  - stack_map_stat computed the success rate as successes * 100 before
    dividing, which can overflow u64 now that the counters saturate at
    LONG_MAX. Uses mul_u64_u64_div_u64().
  - stack_map_bin allocated a fresh snapshot on every open, so
    repeatedly opening without closing could pin a lot of vmalloc
    space. It is now single-open.
  - stackmap_seq_start() and stackmap_seq_next() held the seq_file
    position in a u32, narrowing the loff_t the iterator is handed.
    The position is driven by our own next() and bounded by map_size,
    so this was not reachable in practice, but the correctness of the
    truncation depended on an invariant that was not visible locally.
    Both now keep it in a loff_t.

Still open
==========

Eager vs lazy allocation. The element pool is allocated at fs_initcall
when CONFIG_FTRACE_STACKMAP=y, regardless of whether userspace ever
enables the option (~8 MB at the default bits=14, up to ~135 MB at
bits=18). This keeps the hot path allocation-free with no
allocation-failure path under tracing pressure. v5 keeps eager
allocation; if you would rather not pay the resident cost when the
option is never enabled, switching to lazy allocation on the first
'echo 1 > options/stackmap' is a contained change and I will do it in
v6 rather than hold this version on it.

stack_map_bin is kept as-is. Steven's suggestion to give the bin entry
a flexible array member is taken as acceptance that the binary
interface can land now; say the word if you would rather ship the text
interface first.

Test results
============

QEMU (aarch64 virt, v7.2-rc4 + this series), no BUG/WARNING/Oops in
any run:
  - functional suite: 19/19 PASS. Covers stack_map_bin magic/version
    (0x46534d42 / 1, confirming the flexible-array change did not move
    the on-disk layout), the single-open guard returning EBUSY on a
    second open and recovering after close, reset now being accepted
    while tracing is on, reset clearing the map (11 -> 0 entries) while
    leaving the ring buffer untouched (149 -> 149 stack_id records),
    the success_rate computation, and global-vs-secondary instance
    gating including the trace_options write rejection.
  - function_graph + stackmap: 4/4 PASS with 173 stack_id events in the
    graph output, rendering as
      ksoftirqd/0-14  [000] d..2.  6.731781: <stack_id 16416>
    i.e. punted to the event's own printer rather than being formatted
    as a graph comment, which is what the print_graph_function_flags()
    fix is for.
  - boot-time activation (trace_options=stackmap,stacktrace on the
    kernel cmdline): 3/3 PASS, 58 stacks and 421 hits recorded before
    init runs, 0 drops.

Build: kernel/trace/{trace_stackmap,trace,trace_functions_graph}.o
compile clean (0 errors, 0 warnings) with the arm64 cross toolchain.

Device retention numbers above were collected on a Xiaomi SM8850
(ARM64) running an Android workload, comparing the same buffer with
the option off and on.

Known limitations
=================

- Per-instance stackmap support is not included; the option is gated
  to the global instance (in the tracefs layout and at the
  set_tracer_flag() write path). Per-instance maps are a follow-up.
- Deduplication is best-effort, not strict: under heavy concurrent
  contention two CPUs racing with the same stack hash may each claim a
  different slot, producing a few duplicate entries; ref_count is then
  split across them. This keeps the hot path lock-free.
- reset clears the map only and leaves the ring buffer alone, so
  stack_ids in an already-collected trace can stop resolving after a
  reset, as described above.
- The stackmap covers kernel stacks only.
- stack_map_bin is a best-effort snapshot, serialized against reset
  but not a fully atomic export.
- trace-cmd / libtraceevent integration is left for follow-up.
