no need to apologize, we can make mistakes, and that's our job as
maintainers to catch them :)

Well, I guess it was the first time you started the laptop, until
hid-multitouch gets loaded.

Actually, it's even worse than that.

Because some vendors are not using standard HID usages, we do have a
`HID_UP_HPVENDOR2` definition of (Usage Page 0xFF01). And hid-input.c
considers that this is only used by HP laptops/keyboards, and then we
have some fancy mapping of non standard usages.

The real fix would be to actually ensure this mapping is only triggered
for:
- keyboards
- HP platforms

But, there is always a but, `HID_UP_HPVENDOR` was there since the origin
of time (git conversion IIRC), and `HID_UP_HPVENDOR2` appeared in 2012.

We do have some info on the affected devices (VID/PID) but nothing else
like the report descriptor. So it's the typical case of "damn, we can't
fix this without possibly regressing a lot of existing hardware".

Technically, we could simply convert these 0x01 and 0x00 into 0x05 and
this would make the mapping ignored by hid-input.c

However, when changing those bytes in the hid-recorder output and
replaying the device this creates a 10 seconds freeze on my desktop
because some component is not happy about the empty input node it creates.

I'm trying to investigate what is going on, without much success. I'll
continue working on it on Monday.

So:
- mt_input_mapping() in hid-multitouch -> probably not. Having such
  quirk in the hid-multitouch code would be better handled with a proper
  quirk, not a random check in mt_input_mapping().
- HID-BPF: so far, if it weren't for that 10s freeze, I would have said
  yes, go for it. But right now there is something fishy in the code
  that creates empty input devices that are not properly cleaned up by
  hid-input and that messes up userspace.
 
Ideally we should fix the generic mapping, but that has a strong chance
of regressing existing HW, which is a PITA.

And to add to the bucket, when replaying your device, I see that fwupd
is trying to communicate with the device, so we should be sure to not
break this as well :(

Hopefully I'll have a better understanding next week.

Cheers,
Benjamin
