Yeah, it is a bit unwieldy. I didn't see any amazing ways to break it up,
but I can definitely try harder. Let's see how it looks after addressing
all of your feedback.

Thanks so much for your detailed review! I really appreciate it!

Yeah, I debated this a bit originally, and I agree it's a bit confusing.
How about this: I'll keep the option, but force it to be just a filename,
not a full path. At least to me that makes it less confusing. Hopefully
that's OK?

Removed and made sure the test suite covers.

Improved the TODO to incorporate this.

Removed from this patch. It comes back when compression / FIT image
support is added but the code never relies on the extension being correct.

I hope it's OK, but I ended up deciding to move NodeTree into
pylibfdt/libfdt.i. I can move it back here if you want, but it felt
like others could want to use this too. If you want it in a separate
file or back in fdtfactor, let me know.

I split out get_node() and create_path(), where create_path() creates the
missing parts of the path and then also returns the final node. Hopefully
that works for you.

That doesn't seem to match how the existing pylibfdt works. My agent
says "Existing pylibfdt requires str for node names, paths, and property
names, and bytes/bytearray for property values."

I confirmed this myself by running this (my example uses the properties()
method added by my next version of the patch series for testing, but
that doesn't actually affect the result):

  fdtro =3D libfdt.FdtRo(open("sc7180-trogdor-lazor-r9.dtb", "rb").read())
  [prop.name for prop in fdtro.properties(0)]

I got back:
  ['interrupt-parent', '#address-cells', ... ]

Specifically, I didn't get back [b'interrupt-parent', ...]. That being
said, while the existing bindings make the property names strings, the
values seem to be bytes:

  [prop for prop in fdtro.properties(0)][3]
  Property(b'Google Lazor (rev9)\x00')

So I think we're OK. My assumption is that the python bindings were
written this way because:

1. It would be a pain to use b'' strings everywhere.
2. Property names ought to be safe to convert back and forth to python
   strings.

Please yell if I'm misunderstanding.

Again, I don't think this matches the existing python bindings.
  first_off =3D [suboff for suboff in fdtro.subnodes(0)][0]
  fdtro.get_path(first_off)

That gives me back: '/aliases', not b'/aliases'.

NOTE: the above uses the subnodes() method added by my next version of
the patch series for testing, but that doesn't actually affect the result.

It makes more sense when you get to the later patch that adds FIT image
support (where DTBs are extracted from memory rather than a file).
Actually, let me move raw_bytes to that patch to keep this patch smaller
and then it will all hopefully make more sense.

This is basically just the pythonic way of providing an alternate
constructor, right? In v1, the main __init__ was used for the
"--verify" option, which is now gone. So yeah, we can make
constructing from a path be the only constructor and move to
__init__.

Done. NodeTree.unflatten() now unflattens the entire FDT (including
/__symbols__ and /__local_fixups__), and ParsedDtb pops __symbols__ and
__local_fixups__ from self.root.children and processes them directly from
the unflattened NodeTree nodes.

This became unflatten() in NodeTree, which is small/simple. Other work
in ParsedDtb happens in separate passes.

Done. _apply_local_fixups() now zeros the phandle cells directly in
target_node.props[prop_name] and stores the fixups in
target_node.fixups[prop_name].

Right. _build_base_tree() only calls select_best_candidate() on
common_prop_names (properties that exist in all input DTBs for that node).

Added an explanation in the docstring: each FDT property in the structure
block carries a 12-byte header (4-byte FDT_PROP tag + 4-byte length +
4-byte nameoff) in addition to its value bytes.

Done. _find_common_nodes_and_phandles() now directly builds and returns
the common base_root NodeTree with each node's phandle attribute set to
its assigned base DTB phandle (or None if it doesn't need one),
eliminating the separate dicts/sets altogether.

Sigh, this is where me not understanding 100% of the details of overlays
bites me. Some background. I remember there being some talk a little while
ago of (perhaps) shipping device trees compiled with '-L'. That would
allow the OS to know for sure which properties represented phandles and
that could help the OS figure out device dependencies. I wanted to make
sure that running fdtfactor wouldn't break this and the OS would still
have all the information it needed even after breaking things up into
overlays and re-applying.

In order to test this, I wanted to make sure we tested re-combining the
base devicetrees and overlays and we could confirm that everything was
there. In order to make all that work, my agent added a bunch of extra
'/fragment@0/__overlay__/__local_fixups__'. ...but it turns out that was
a workaround for the fact that fdt_overlay_apply() didn't preserve
__local_fixups__ in the base. :(

I'll give a shot at adding a patch to fix that and hopefully things will
be a lot cleaner.

With the fdt_overlay_apply() fix in place, all of this special-casing
for preserve_local_fixups is gone.

I added a TODO item for this. I'm a bit curious, though. In general
these overlays aren't _really_ expected to be human readable. It's
just about using overlays to make things small. As I understand it,
we won't really get any space savings by being smarter here. My
agent thinks that in a few very targeted cases we could get a
tiny space savings, but otherwise putting everything in '/fragment@0'
is actually a better solution, even if it would be ugly for someone
directly reading the overlay.

FWIW, I'm a bit out of my league in overlay understanding here. I'm going
to be lame and paste in my AI's answer here. Sorry. :( If this makes no
sense, I'll go educate myself:

Agreed. In v2 I've removed that fallback so fdtfactor never emits an overla=
y
property with a hardcoded base-tree phandle. Instead, if a non-root node ha=
s
a phandle in some input DTB but lacks a common symbol in /__symbols__ acros=
s
all input DTBs (which actually happens in the downstream Pixel 10 trees whe=
re
two boards define /module_power_seq@2 with different label names),
_find_common_nodes_and_phandles() keeps that node out of base.dtb so each
board's .dtbo creates it with a normal overlay-local phandle and
/__local_fixups__. If the root node / itself ever had a phandle without a
common symbol and was referenced by an overlay property, fdtfactor rejects
it outright with an error.

Actually, a board-only node (not in_base_dtb) might have no properties of
its own (e.g. an empty container node or one that only has subnodes), in
which case diff_props is empty but we still need to create the node in the
overlay.

Done. Normalized paths now use '' for the root node and '/...' for
subnodes, eliminating the path =3D=3D '/' special cases.

verify_recreated_dtb() is gone now (replaced by fdtoverlay +
dtbs_equal_unordered in tests/run_tests.sh), so fdtfactor no longer calls
fdt_overlay_apply() from Python.
