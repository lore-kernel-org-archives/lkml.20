Trying to parse this: Before we had a PERF_RECORD_MMAP with a dso name
that we, at the end, when enabled, would look for a build-id to add to
the perf.data headers, now we get both in the PERF_RECORD_MMAP3, right?

From the cache, right, and that is a problem, we need to do that LRU you
mention, to not have a ever growing cache.

There is a recent patch from someone at Uber about another aspect of
this, the symtabs loaded in memory for resolving symbols are not in any
way constrained, we go on loading, not purging, hope that patch gets
resubmitted addressing the sashiko reviews that were acknowledged.

IIRC what I saw was the debuginfod client not finding things in the
cache when that DEBUGINFO_URLS variable wasn't set, so setting it
doesn't mean to ask for downloads necessarily, but to use what is
already cached locally.

We need to stop using ~/.debug/ and move to have the cache where elfutils
libraries have it.

Transitioning should just use ~/.debug if available but saving copies of
local DSOs like perf does in the elfutils cache directory.

Agreed, will do.
