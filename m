Commit b1034a690129 ("cgroup/cpuset: Ensure domain isolated CPUs stay in 
root or isolated partition") comes after 103b08709e8a. From my point of 
view, the first commit is the one that introduces the bug. The second 
commit comes along assuming the existing code is right. That is why I 
didn't tag the second one even though the second one is easier to 
trigger than the first one.

OK, will update the commit log.

Yes, I can drop this part.

If the parent is a valid isolated partition before the child partition 
is created, it had passed the isolated_cpus_can_update() check. So 
returning the CPUs back to its parent is fine.

Yes, that made sense though the current placement should cause any problem.

Yes, it should.

I need to take a further look at that.
