Looking more into this (and the memory hotplug story), I find it strange
that simply having RME and a valid RMM imposes all these restrictions
even if we never run or intend to run a realm. How common will
RME-capable systems with RMM firmware be that are not used for CoCo? Or
do we expect only CoCo systems to have capable/configured firmware (RME
may be present in silicon anyway)?

Ideally we'd defer the RMM configuration and activation (and the
tracking/GPT checks) until we first attempt to start a realm, keeping
only the RMI_VERSION/FEATURES probing at boot. Not sure how feasible
this is (memory is more fragmented by then for any contiguous donation).
If we manage it, kexec and memory hotplug just work on hosts that never
start a realm.

The next best thing for kexec is to tear down the realms, undelegate
the granules and deactivate the RMM before invoking kexec (with kdump
that's harder as we likely no longer have a controlled shutdown).

Similarly with memory hotplug, allow it if we haven't started any realms
and refuse realm creation afterwards if untracked memory was onlined.
Also, if the memory is onlined to ZONE_MOVABLE, neither guest_memfd nor
the kernel allocations we delegate come from there, so we could allow
it even with realms running.

Yes, I think so. I now realised that metadata delegation to the RMM
doesn't come from guest_memfd, so that's another case not helped by the
old series to unmap guest_memfd from the linear map. I'll reply to the
GPF thread.
