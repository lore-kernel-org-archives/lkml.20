Very much aligned. The comments below help a lot in identifying what

The per-CPU structure is not a performance optimization we can defer -- it
is required by the calling context.  A perf-event overflow handler runs in
NMI context, which cannot take a mutex or any sleeping lock.
damon_report_access() takes a mutex, so it cannot be called from there.
Per-CPU SPSC rings are the correct primitive for a lockless producer (NMI
overflow handler) to consumer (kdamond drain) handoff, not an optional
improvement over a simpler shared ring. I am planning to retain per-CPU
rings for v3 because of this reason.

Understood.  I included the page-fault source in v2 because the December
2025 RFC [1] that introduced damon_report_access() had it as the primary
consumer, and I wanted to carry forward that ability.  Since it is out of
scope for milestone 2, I will drop it from v3.

Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be dropped from the v3 submission since they are
all tied to the page fault path.

Got it. Will scope v3 to PA only. so included results for v3 would be based=

You are right.  Region age accumulates whenever nr_accesses stays at zero
across aggregation boundaries, and that holds whether the zero comes from a
PTE scan or from an empty perf-event drain.

I was initially concerned that a sparse sampling PMU might not cover every
cold region in every aggregation window, leaving silence that could be
mistaken for cold,
whereas page faults provide higher spatial coverage for confirming
first-access.  Having both together was intended as a defence against that =
gap.

Based on your observation I retested this on hardware.  On AMD Turin
the cold demotion scheme found and demoted the idle working set
correctly using only the hardware-sampled IBS signal -- nr_accesses aged to=
 zero
for regions that genuinely had no traffic, and the scheme acted on age as
expected.  The combined design may still be worth exploring later when
page fault
is considered to be reintroduced in phase 3.

With the page fault primitive out of scope there is no case for two ring

Thank you.  Looking forward to seeing DAMON grow to support these use cases=
.

Summary of what v3 will contain (5 patches, former patches 5-9 of v2):
  - paddr-only, single ring class, no page fault primitive
  - per-CPU rings retained (required by NMI calling context, not an
    optimization)
  - perf-event overflow handler (paddr path, vaddr parts deferred to phase =
3)
  - sysfs/lifecycle surface
  - probe-weighted score
  - kunit tests updated for the simplified scope

Separate send targeting mm-new:
  - tracepoint (former patch 4)
