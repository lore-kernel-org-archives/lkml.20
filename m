Hi again,

I think I now mostly understand the remaining problems, both relate to 
multipass resource assignment logic. First of all this seems required as 
well:

diff --git a/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c b/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c
index b662cbeda51e..b5fdcb10d45a 100644
--- a/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c
+++ b/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c
@@ -2206,8 +2206,10 @@ static void pci_prepare_next_assign_round(struct list_head *fail_head,
 	list_for_each_entry(fail_res, fail_head, list) {
 		struct pci_bus *bus = fail_res->dev->bus;
 		struct resource *b_win;
+		unsigned long flags;
 
-		b_win = pbus_select_window_for_type(bus, fail_res->flags);
+		flags = pci_bus_placement_flags(bus, fail_res->flags);
+		b_win = pbus_select_window_for_type(bus, flags);
 		if (!b_win)
 			continue;
 		pci_bus_release_bridge_resources(bus, b_win, rel_type);

In addition, pci_bus_release_bridge_resources() -> 
pci_bridge_release_resources() -> release_child_resources() may release 
additional resources, some of which may be assigned to a different bridge 
window by FW than where kernel will try to put them in the next pass. If 
there are no failed resources for that other bridge window in the fail 
list, the other bridge window is not released and thus doesn't get sized 
properly.

Likely, the best course of action would be to wrap release_child_resources()
with PCI level equivalent (it would improve printing as well as then the 
resources are properly annotated with the device information).

That would also likely make it possible to avoid tearing down resources 
that are in use by some endpoint driver (which was recently reported to 
occur, during hotplug IIRC).

I hope this helps.
