Hey Linus,

As is the new normal, this is larger set of fixes for this cycle. I have
a bunch of fixes in the pipeline but no need to delay the current set
any longer than necessary.

/* Summary */

- writeback:

  * Update dirtied_when instead of dirtied_time_when when a wb switch
    puts an inode at the newest end of the target b_dirty list. The list
    was left out of order so move_expired_inodes() could stop before
    older inodes, and the lazytime expiration timestamp was reset.

  * Clear the old wb's dirty-I/O state and bandwidth contribution when a
    batch of inode switches leaves its dirty lists empty. An empty wb
    stayed scheduled for periodic writeback and inflated
    bdi->tot_write_bandwidth.

  * Take wb_switch_rwsem across the inode scan of
    cleanup_offline_cgwb(). The v7.3-rc5 fix that rotates scanned inodes
    let a scan racing a sync()'s queue_io() move lazytime inodes past
    the sync's cutoff, so sync() returned without persisting their
    timestamps.

  * Don't kick writeback for an IOCB_DONTCACHE write on an inode that
    has no wb yet. With cgroup writeback an O_DIRECT RWF_DONTCACHE write
    to a block device dereferenced NULL.

- statmount/listmount/listns:

  * Refuse statmount() string requests with a buffer that isn't larger
    than struct statmount.

  * Don't wrap around with a U64_MAX cursor in listmount() and listns().

  * Don't end listns() at an inactive namespace.

  * Only add init_ipc_ns and init_net to the namespace trees if
    CONFIG_IPC_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS are enabled.

- iomap:

  * Only mark blocks uptodate in __iomap_write_begin() after reading
    them and let __iomap_write_end() mark the zeroed blocks uptodate
    once the copy from userspace succeeded.

  * Check a chunk against max_integrity_io_size() on its own before the
    bio size check.

  * Only enforce block alignment for direct I/O into holes and
    unwritten extents if IOMAP_DIO_FSBLOCK_ALIGNED is set.

- backing-file:

  * Check S_APPEND and S_IMMUTABLE on the backing inode. FUSE
    passthrough opens the backing file with vfs_open() which skips
    may_open(), so anyone who may open the FUSE file for writing could
    overwrite an append-only backing file anywhere or write to an
    immutable one. Open, mmap and writes now check the backing inode
    the way may_open() and do_mmap() do.

  * Always call kiocb_end_write() for a queued write

  * Let backing files inherit FMODE_NONOTIFY from the user file. The
    event fds fanotify creates for permission events on a stacked
    filesystem raised FS_OPEN_PERM on the real path from inside the
    listener's read() and deadlocked listeners with marks on both
    layers.

- pidfs:

  * Look the task up before checking for exit information in
    PIDFD_GET_INFO and start over if the task no longer owns the pid
    once all fields have been read. A caller racing release_task() got
    neither PIDFD_INFO_PID nor PIDFD_INFO_EXIT or ESRCH although the
    exit information was available, and a caller racing a sub-thread's
    exec reported that thread's tid as the pid.

  * Clear the mask bits of fields that lie beyond the struct size the
    caller passed. The uapi header promises that the mask names no such
    field but a caller passing PIDFD_INFO_SIZE_VER0 got the coredump and
    supported mask bits set for fields that were never written.

- aio:

  * Give the aio ring a ->read_folio that fails with EIO so a fault on a
    ring whose file was truncated gets SIGBUS instead of jumping to
    NULL.

  * Check nr_events against the ring size before doubling it in
    ioctx_alloc().

- splice:

  * Only write back an implicit file position in do_splice() when the
    splice helper succeeded. splice doesn't take f_pos_lock so a failed
    splice restored a stale snapshot over a position that a concurrent
    getdents() had moved. On ext2 the next readdir then trusted an
    offset inside a directory entry.

  * Retry tee() when the input pipe was emptied or the output pipe
    filled between the prep steps and link_pipe() instead of returning 0
    while the input pipe still has writers, as splice_pipe_to_pipe()
    does.

- ucount:

  * Take the reference that pins a ucounts level on the 0 -> 1
    transition before checking the rlimit.

  * Read the parent ucounts before dropping the rlimit count in
    do_dec_rlimit_put_ucounts().

- inode:

  * Rotate inodes whose page cache couldn't be dropped to the tail of
    the LRU.

  * Skip inodes that another LRU walker is isolating.

- setns:

  * Set nsset->flags before anything in prepare_nsset() can fail so the
    error path drops the cred prepared for CLONE_NEWUSER. A failing
    setns() with CLONE_NEWUSER and CLONE_NEWNS leaked it together with
    its user namespace.

  * Refuse setns(CLONE_NEWNS) for a task that shares its fs_struct again
    when more namespaces are requested.

- minix:

  * Restore uptodate on the pinned bitmap buffers before redirtying them
    after a failed writeback instead of tripping the warning in
    mark_buffer_dirty(), as ext2 and ext4 do for their superblock
    buffers.

  * Reject rmdir() of a directory with a corrupted link count with
    EFSCORRUPTED instead of hitting the drop_nlink() warning.

- userns: Keep the exec securebits and their locks when creating or
  joining a user namespace. set_cred_user_ns() reset all securebits to
  SECUREBITS_DEFAULT so anyone who may create a user namespace could
  shed SECBIT_EXEC_RESTRICT_FILE and SECBIT_EXEC_DENY_INTERACTIVE with a
  single unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER).

- fs: Honor FOP_UNSIGNED_OFFSET in sys_llseek() and in the pread64(),
  pwrite64(), preadv() and pwritev() wrappers.

- proc/kcore: Advance the vmalloc retry in read_kcore_iter() by the
  last vread_iter() copy instead of the running total.

- eventpoll: Return the error when the wakeup source for EPOLLWAKEUP
  can't be created in EPOLL_CTL_MOD instead of reporting success
  without suspend protection.

- coredump: Mark do_coredump() noinline_for_stack.

- nsfs: Check the trailing bytes of a namespace file handle in bytes
  instead of words.

- netfs: Restore the per-level and per-point decoding of the debug
  mask.

- exportfs: Release the directory file get_name() opened with
  __fput_sync(). From nfsd's kernel threads the deferred fputs arrived
  faster than delayed_fput retired them and each pinned the directory's
  readdir state, growing unreclaimable slab by about 90 MB per second
  under a parallel tree walk.

- fs: Call ramfs_kill_sb() for a ramfs rootfs. Since rootfs can be
  unmounted as of v7.0 its struct ramfs_fs_info was leaked.

- signal: Check the blocked mask for every entry
  dequeue_synchronous_signal() looks at. The scan could select a blocked
  synchronous signal and deliver it while blocked.

- super: Convert the superblock device table from an rhltable to a
  plain hashtable under a spinlock. This fixes a bug from v7.3 where
  fs_bdev_freeze() froze a btrfs filesystem through a stale member that
  open_ctree() had already released while the freeze was waiting for SB_BORN.

- fork: Leave rcu_users at zero until copy_process() can't fail anymore.
  bpf_task_acquire() handed out trusted references to the new task from
  the task_alloc LSM hook and sched_ext's ops.init_task() and a failing
  fork freed the task behind them.

- xattr: Always run cap_convert_nscap() for a security.capability write.
  A zero-length setxattr() skipped it and let an unprivileged caller
  without CAP_SETFCAP or write permission on the file plant an empty
  security.capability xattr that made every execve() of the binary fail
  with EINVAL.

- namei: Skip the S_ISDIR assertion in

- proc: Refuse to mount on entries below /proc/<pid>/net like fd/,
  fdinfo/ and map_files/. proc_net_d_revalidate() always fails so the
  first lookup by anyone with search permission ran d_invalidate() on
  the dentry and detached every mount on it, locked mounts included.

- libfs: Hold one mount reference for all pins instead of one per pin.
  The pin count is what keeps the mount alive, so the per-pin reference
  only cost a mntget() and a mntput() through
  mntput_no_expire_slowpath() for every debugfs, tracefs, securityfs or
  configfs file that comes and goes.

- iov_iter: Return 0 from iov_iter_alignment() for an empty iterator of
  any type.

- watch_queue: Give info_id its own storage instead of overlaying it
  with rcu_head.

- filelock: Take an active superblock reference while waiting for a
  delegation break. After a lazy umount closing the delegation holder
  could shut down the superblock under the waiter whose final iput()
  then ran shmem_evict_inode() on freed state.

- fs: Skip the copy_file_range() write limit checks when there is no
  data to copy.

- bpf: Allow bpf_d_path() from fentry on filp_close_sync(). Since
  close_range() became synchronous this cycle close(), close_range()
  and the closes on exec and exit no longer go through filp_close().
  fexit stays rejected since the file may be gone by then.

- fs_pin: Dequeue the wait entry unconditionally in pin_kill(). A
  spuriously woken waiter kept its on-stack entry queued, took that as
  proof that the pin was alive and used the freed acct structure when
  umount() of the accounting file raced acct(2).

- dcache: Don't fail __d_obtain_alias() for an inode without links and
  aliases. The ESTALE check added this cycle broke open_by_handle_at()
  and nfsd file handle decoding on NFS and FUSE where i_nlink is just
  what the server last reported and the handle may well still be valid.

- selftests/ovl: Fix the mountinfo expectations of the detached layer
  test which has failed since it was added.
