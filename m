Thank you for clarifying, Ravi.  But, what I wanted to say is, we could update
damon_report_access() to not use mutex but atomic operations.  Does that make
sense?  FYI, damon_report_access() will also be renamed, say,
damon_report_attr().

Makes sense, thank you!

Sounds good, thank you for the testing Ravi!

Sounds good!

Looking forward to the patch!

Makes sense.  And regardless of my global ring idea, feel free to keep the
per-CPU rings.  As long as it is an RFC, please feel free to implement it in an
easy-to-implement way.

Please also note that I'm still working on shaping the milestone 2
deliverables.  I'm not yet in a stage that I can share how it will really look
like.  So the final version of your work might need a significant amount of
change to rebase on it.  I will also try to make it not unnecessarily delayed
more than our planned timeline.  But please bear in mind with me.

Looking forward to it.
