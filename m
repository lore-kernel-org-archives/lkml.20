Your Hyrum's law point made me look at the parser, and I'm glad it
did, because the behavior is more subtle than "all of them work".
psi_write() does

        buf[buf_size - 1] = '\0';

i.e. it overwrites the last byte of whatever was written. With a plain
strlen()-sized write that eats the last digit: "some 150000 2000000"
silently arms a 200000us window when privileged, and fails with EINVAL
for unprivileged users (200000 is not a multiple of the 2s minimum). I
reproduced both on 7.0.0-28 here. I suspect your runs succeeded
because a truncated window still makes a valid trigger for root, so
nothing looked off.

I went with your \n variant instead: the newline gets clobbered, the
payload stays intact, and it is the conventional procfile form. So the
reliance on the undocumented NUL is gone, even though not quite via
strlen()+0.

Two follow-ups this suggests, if there is interest (I'm not pushing
either within this series):

- psi.rst says nothing about the terminator while sysfs documents its
  (append, not clobber) behavior explicitly; a sentence in psi.rst
  would at least make the convention discoverable.
- kernfs and sysfs both append the NUL after the written data, so the
  user bytes survive. psi_write() could do the same with
  buf_size = min(nbytes, sizeof(buf) - 1) and buf[buf_size] = '\0'.
  Terminator-terminated writes keep their exact meaning, and a bare
  strlen() write would parse in full instead of losing its last digit.
  That would be the more principled fix, but it is a behavior change
  for unterminated writes, so it needs a call from the PSI maintainers.

Agreed, the helper is silent now. The duplicate was my own doing: I
added the print in v5 on Suren's v4 request (it replaced a raw
fprintf) without noticing the SKIP message right below it already
carries the reason, so removing it satisfies both comments.

You're right, they are not environment problems. They are ASSERTs in
FIXTURE_SETUP() now, so a run without privileges fails loudly instead
of vanishing into skips.

Dropped.

I tried both of your variants before picking one. The half-window
threshold with (3*ncpus+1)/2 hogs fired reliably, and the two-threshold
variant also held up on the negative side: with the threshold equal to
the whole window, ncpus+1 hogs never fired it (measured cpu.pressure
"some" stays around 2-17% under that oversubscription, so the margin
is comfortable rather than borderline). I kept the existing tiny-
threshold test and added cgroup_trigger_no_fire for the whole-window
side, which matches your second variant and keeps the hog setup shared.

All 7 tests pass on a 2-CPU and a 16-CPU machine.

Thank you both, this series learned a lot from you: Suren walked me
through the harness conversion and the reporting details, and you kept
the semantics honest, which is what surfaced the parser behavior. The
test is in a much better shape than what I started with, and the
parser finding above came out of your push on both directions of the
trigger.

Thanks
