Right, the whole point of kmem_buckets was to replace general kmalloc
uses, where no callers cared about alignment.

Completely. I was blinded by the API of kmem_cache_create(). :)

Okay. (We have no users of this yet, FWIW.)

Right.

I think it's fine from studying what happens with the skb data. Though
right now, SLAB_ACCOUNT and SLAB_MAY_ACCOUNT are functionally identical,
yes?

*ignored* is, I think, wrong here. It would create differing behavior
between SLAB_BUCKETS=y/n. If we passed __GFP_ACCOUNT through to general
kmalloc when the buckets lacked SLAB_ACCOUNT and SLAB_MAY_ACCOUNT, you'd
lose the isolation, but not the accounting. (And could WARN_ONCE about
it.) But if it was ignored, you'd lose accounting under
SLAB_BUCKETS=y.

Agreed. That's what I was going for on this version. But like above,
"SLAB_ACCOUNT requires __GFP_ACCOUNT" means what? Under SLAB_BUCKETS=y
the allocation returns NULL? Or it passes through with WARN_ONCE? I'd
rather not break something completely; better to fallback on a mismatch
so the requested type happens (be it DMA, ACCOUNTing, etc).
