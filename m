Perhaps, but that does not mean we are allowed to break it now.

More specifically, would the output of 'lspci' change as a result?

Again, maybe not, but if something that works fine today stops
working because the PCI subsystem started lying to the driver about
how the PCIe device describes itself, we'll be on the hook to fix it.

That would mean that a driver may decide to use ioremap_wc() rather than
ioremap() to map a non-prefetchable BAR that we decided to misrepresent
as a prefetchable one. Even if the (pseudo-)PCI-PCI bridge will not do
any readahead, the CPU or interconnect may behave very differently as a
result, and touch BAR regions that the driver never accessed explicitly.

No, I am referring to the hundreds of ioremap() and ioremap_wc() calls
under drivers. Maybe none of them are affected but who knows.

Maybe add another IORESOURCE_PREFETCH_xxx flag that indicates that the
resource may be placed in a prefetchable bridge window? We'd only have
to set it in a single place (when probing the BAR), and we can add
support for it piecemeal in the validation and allocation logic.
