Clearly we *can*, it's a question of what'd be acceptable - it'd result
in the compiler emitting a bunch of extra alternatives and conditionals
in the context switch path.

Sanitising the writes is a bit tricky since multiple ID registers are
involved, TCRX and S1PIE are in ID_AA64MMFR3_EL1 while GCS is in
ID_AA64PFR1_EL1 so you'd create an ordering constraint for userspace,
and you'd also have to handle the case where TCR2 or S1PIE are turned
off with GCS already enabled.  It feels like a bunch of complication,
especially if you start applying the same approach with other features.

If we're going to validate the ID registers it feels safer to check at
the point where we finalise the ID registers and refuse to start the
vCPU if there's an unsupportable configuration, that would mean the
check would only need to be done in one place and userspace wouldn't
trip over any ordering requirements with how it updates registers.  Only
userspaces that set architecturally invalid configurations should see an
error.  We could also handle things by fixing up the configuration at
the same point, disabling features that are missing their dependencies,
that's a bit more friendly in the short term but could lead to trouble
later on as it means we hide issues in userspace.

I think the best thing overall would be to leave the runtime paths as
they are and refuse to run with an architecturally invalid setup, that
would avoid bloating the fast path.
