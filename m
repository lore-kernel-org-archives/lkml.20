Commit 41a7968022ca ("sched/deadline: Fix total_bw leak when switching
away from SCHED_DEADLINE while !queued") releases the bandwidth of a
task that leaves SCHED_DEADLINE asleep with no inactive timer pending.
Three cases release what the root domain no longer holds, or never held:

 - the task keeps its parameters. inactive_task_timer() resets them
   once it has released the bandwidth (__dl_clear_params()); left in
   place, task_contending() and task_non_contending() take the task,
   now of another policy, for one with bandwidth when priority
   inheritance boosts it into the deadline class, and a deboost while
   it sleeps releases that bandwidth from total_bw a second time. The
   root domain then admits deadline tasks beyond its capacity;
 - a task deboosted from priority inheritance with no parameters of its
   own, and a special one (SCHED_FLAG_SUGOV), have no bandwidth in
   total_bw. Releasing 0 changes nothing, and the root domain that
   dl_task_root_domain_cpu() finds from the task's mask means nothing
   either: a sleeping task of another policy may have no active CPU in
   its mask, a CPU it is pinned to having gone offline, until its next
   wakeup widens it;
 - migrate_task_rq_dl() clears dl_non_contending when it cannot cancel
   the inactive timer because its handler runs. That handler, once it
   takes the task's locks, finds it out of SCHED_DEADLINE and releases
   total_bw itself.

Release for a task with parameters of its own, not special, and clear
its bandwidth afterwards, once sub_rq_bw(), which reads it, is done:
every path that would release it again then takes a dl_bw of 0, and a
handler that runs late finds nothing to release. A test of
hrtimer_active() would not tell that handler apart: it stays true after
the handler returns, until the hrtimer code clears its running state,
and the bandwidth of a task switched out meanwhile would never be
released.

The parameters themselves stay, where inactive_task_timer() resets them
along with the bandwidth, because the task may still be the donor of a
priority inheritance boost: rt_mutex_adjust_pi() walks the chain and
deboosts the owner after the runqueue lock of the policy change is
dropped, and until it does, a replenishment of that owner, which
update_curr_dl_se() does at once for a boosted entity, would run
replenish_dl_entity() on a donor whose dl_runtime and dl_period are 0.
It would warn and then never leave

	while (dl_se->runtime <= 0) {
		dl_se->deadline += pi_of(dl_se)->dl_period;
		dl_se->runtime += pi_of(dl_se)->dl_runtime;
	}

with the runqueue lock held and interrupts off. __setparam_dl() sets
the parameters anew if the task comes back, and inactive_task_timer()
resets them at its 0-lag time if it does not.

The deadline_bw_test selftest, added later in this series, reproduces
the first case as pi_former_owner_asleep: in a one-CPU partition with
room, the waiter of its second round is refused as a deadline task,
total_bw having wrapped. The other two were found by reading.

The donor window was found by the Sashiko AI review of the first posting
of this series, and shown with a kernel carrying mdelay(20) before
rt_mutex_adjust_pi() to widen it: a deadline task blocks on a
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT mutex with its runtime unspent, and is switched to
SCHED_OTHER while the owner it boosts spins. Clearing the parameters
there, that kernel warns in replenish_dl_entity() and stops, on round 4
and round 3 of two 8-CPU VMs; clearing the bandwidth alone, both go
through their eight rounds.
