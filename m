Yes, I got that. The question is if the precaution is really needed.
Are "reg" properties common in ACPI nodes?

Yes, I figured as much, which is why I directed the question at Andy.

I'd rather tweak the check to exclude ACPI (instead of including OF and
SW) with a code comment about why ACPI is excluded. That is, if it can
be determined that ACPI actually needs to be excluded. If it is hard to
get an answer to that question, I'm inclined to just attempt to not
exclude ACPI, and then be prepared to exclude ACPI in a follow-up if
there is any fallout.

Cheers,
Peter
