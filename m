I think the readers would know what LRU means, and therefore
'least-recently-used' is not needed.

As I mentioned above, I don't think the above change is needed.

I cannot find what's wrong with the original sentence.  Could you expalin?
Also, I think the updated sentence is rather easier to misread.

I think use of brackets is also fine.  Let me know if I'm missing something.
