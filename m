Indeed, the description was generated by LLM, but I thought that was clear enough
to present what this patch do and why. Aparrently, you don't like that style, I'll
rewrite that by handd.

The goal is only to avoid rmap_item allocation for pages that can never merge
under only_merge_zero_pages. The implementation is simple.

I'll send a v3 with those changes.

Sorry, this is to clarify the difference between get_next_rmap_item() and here.
Maybe too verbose to you ? I can simplify those words.

You are right. Will fix it.

Emmm... I agree scan_get_next_rmap_item() is already too large and needs cleanup.

But it is the main KSM scan path, and a refactor there is high-risk. The cleanup
deserves a separate series with careful review and testing.
