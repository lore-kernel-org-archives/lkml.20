You can not bind/unbind drivers to the same device at the same time, the
driver core should protect yourself from this, BUT most importantly,
bind/unbind is a "best effort, you keep the pieces of the broken kernel
when something goes wrong".

Again no one should be doing this, and if they are, they are root and
can do much worse things :)

Or just prove that this is a real bug please.

Then why did your LLM say that this was found in this way if that's not
what you really did?

People read what you wrote, you should also do so :)
