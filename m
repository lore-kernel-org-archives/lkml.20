This is my point exactly. Each consumer is going to need to do its own
thing and it is why I would prefer if the decision was not a core or
a provider thing.

A decision must be made somewhere. I don't really see where else it
could be made than with the consumer. It is the only one which has
any idea what it is trying acheive.

If the range is about HW capability (from the clock side I mean),
a range can be set from the provider. Some already do that and I
think it is fine for that purpose. In the experiment I've provided,
I did not enable the propagation logic in that case, on purpose.
It could constrain the clock tree for clock that are actually
unused. It still participate in the decision logic if a consumer
enable it however.

Indeed, I suppose an helper could be introduced for that if we don't
already have one. It does not even depend on the experiment presented
here. As long as there is a user for it, it would be fine IMO.

Maybe something that takes a rate and a ratio, like the duty cycle API ?
