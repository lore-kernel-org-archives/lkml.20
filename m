Personally I think in this discussion we should separate linux
filesystems vs non-linux filesystems, as linux filesystems are "ours"
and are the ones we can change as we want, while non-linux filesystems
are not made by "us" and cannot be easily changed (like NFS I would say)
or cannot changed at all (e.g. NTFS (well, unless we make ntfs
incompatible with windows lol)).

But I understand why it would be better to keep a unified API across all
filesystems, even "non-official" ones, so I can think of 2 options
(well, with ntfs/exfat in mind, as I don't know much about NFS/smb):

1) keep btime aliased to ptime, which means that (to userspace) btime
   would be mutable for ntfs/exfat/vfat/etc

2) move ntfs/exfat/vfat/etc's cr_time from btime to ptime, effectively
   "removing" btime from those FSs and "keeping" only ptime; in this case
   stat would show "-" for Birth:, but would show the correct timestamp for
   Origin:/Create:/Provenance:/...

I prefer 1) because it probably breaks less scripts, but 2) would be
more correct semantically.

And both break at least 1 existing script anyway (as per https://xkcd.com/1=
172/).

For my (backups, preservation) use case, making btime mutable would also
be fine, but I can see the value of having a "ctime" for creation, hence
this RFC.

Hi I'm one of those users, I still can't believe no-one has implemented
something like this yet since POSIX came out way back when (*cry*).

My thinking for this RFC would be to then submit relevant patches also
to at least the main tools I use like tar, cp, rsync and vim, which will
hopefully make it gain momentum and be supported also in other less
well-known tools (I would also love for it to be supported by HTTP like
mtime is, but that will likely be a lot more difficult to get accepted
and implemented).

I would also like to note again that xattrs aren't available to symlinks
(or other special files), which would break at least my backup/preservation
use case.
