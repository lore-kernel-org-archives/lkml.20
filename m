The cover letter for this series did not reach the list: the three
patches are in the archive, [PATCH 0/3] is not, and no bounce came back. =
Resent
here so the series context is in the thread rather than nowhere.

The AMD BC-250 is a Zen 2 APU board (Cyan Skillfish) sold as surplus mini=
ng
hardware and now used as a small desktop by a fair number of people. It c=
arries
an AMD Secure Processor at PCI 1022:143e that sp_pci_table[] does not mat=
ch, so
the device has always been left unbound with its memory windows disabled.

Adding the ID turned out to need two fixes first, both of the same shape:=
 the
driver decides what to bring up from the hardware capability register alo=
ne,
and then uses the psp_vdata pointers for those features without checking =
that
this device has them. On this board the two disagree, because the firmwar=
e
advertises a TEE whose ring never comes up.

Patch 1 is a NULL pointer dereference in the sysfs is_visible callback. I=
t
oopses during probe. It needs no new hardware to be reachable in principl=
e:
any device whose firmware sets the TEE capability bit while its psp_vdata
carries no tee data hits it, which today means pspv1 and pspv2 parts. I h=
ave
only observed it on the BC-250, so I have not added a stable tag - please=
 add
one if you think it deserves it.

Patch 2 stops a failed optional sub-device from taking down the rest of t=
he
PSP. Without it, a psp_vdata that deliberately omits TEE gets nothing at =
all,
platform access included.

Patch 3 adds the board. The register layout was read off the device rathe=
r
than assumed, and the numbers are in the commit message.

Tested on a BC-250 running 7.2.6. Before:

  01:00.2 Encryption controller: AMD Device 143e
          Memory at fe700000 [disabled] [size=3D1M]
          Memory at fe884000 [disabled] [size=3D8K]
          (no driver)

After:

  ccp 0000:01:00.2: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
  ccp 0000:01:00.2: platform access enabled
  ccp 0000:01:00.2: psp enabled
  # cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.2/bootloader_version
  00.1c.01.02

with the platform mailbox answering commands. Dynamic boost control is pr=
obed
and cleanly rejected by this firmware, and HSTI reports nothing because t=
he
security reporting capability bit is clear. There is no CCP crypto engine
behind this function: the version register at 0x100 reads back all ones.

The series is against v7.2.6 and touches only drivers/crypto/ccp/.

Mattia Tadini (3):
  crypto: ccp - fix NULL dereference in psp_firmware_is_visible()
  crypto: ccp - do not start PSP sub-devices without their vdata
  crypto: ccp - add support for the AMD BC-250 secure processor
