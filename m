OK, I guess I disagree with myself of 3 months ago?

The technical point being made here, which I think is the more constructive one
to engage with, is that this is a function that can be called with different
parameters for whatever reason.

Somebody might decide to call it for another reason, putting something in the
description of the function that assumes what callers will do when that code can
change is asking for bit rot.

So as I suggested above:

	I think the description of why it might be a partial walk belongs to the
	bit of code that actually tries to do a partial walk.

I.e. I guess past me's description is apt, but belongs with the partial case.

I don't really think that's hugely constructive.

I'm sorry I'm (mildly) disagreeing with my past self, I've sent tens of
thousands of words of review since then so I think it can be forgiven.

In any case, I really do think:

	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss);
	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss);
	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss);
	smap_gather_stats_range(priv, vma, &mss, last_vma_end);

Works better than:

	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss, vma->vm_start);
	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss, vma->vm_start);
	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss, vma->vm_start);
	smap_gather_stats(priv, vma, &mss, last_vma_end);

?

I usually come back on review very quickly so I don't think this series
will be held up with any such change.

But let me know if you think it's not a good idea technically.
