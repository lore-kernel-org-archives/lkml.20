Yes this was explicitly one of the 4 user namespace design goals,
and I don't really want code running on my system that I can't
later control.

You imply that cells don't do this, but the capabilities section below suggests

It's also decided by namespace targeted capabilities (and LSM

Well, you are adding one more runtime (https://xkcd.com/927/ :)  This
particular problem would be better solved using a subuid NSS module.

Of course userspace could do this now - create a userns, create an mntns,
set up the mounts, and then create another userns with identity uid mapping,
so then the container cannot get ns_capable(mnt_ns->userns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to
unmount.

I can envision this being a good strategy for sandbox style runners.

This seems misleading.  It hands any that you want, you just have to specify
them differently, right?

Every task?  But you do say setuid() drops them as usual.  Are you saying
that the first process is uid 0, and capability inheritance just works
as usual?  If not, then some examples would be helpful - and in that
case it sounds like this would be an unexpected method of operation
which would confuse userspace (which can be dangerous).

It seems to me most of the bugs relating to capabilities in user
namespace were not about the privilege leaking, which you seem to
suggest here, but rather about kernel code under an ns_capable()
check being reachable when, without unprivileged user namespaces,
unprivileged users could not have reached them.  Since you open quite
a few capabilities for instance with net_may(), that code is still
reachable.  So you are probably reducing the reachable code, which
is good, but the above is over-stating it.

Also I would continue to be careful about uid mapped filesystems.  If
the host creates a cell with host uid 0 mapped to uid N in the
cell, can a cell process chmod u+s the file, and collude with an
unprivileged host process to run it as host-root?

So what is your goal here?  You list several properties of the current
namespaces implementation, and imply that they are a problem.  But what
is the final goal: is it to implement a security sandbox that is
stronger than what you can currently build from userspace?  That's the
impression I get.  Or is it to avoid bugs in userspace, by simplifying
what userspace needs to do?  Knowing the goal will help review the
patchset.set.

Also, how does this jive with criu?  Is it introducing any cell identifiers
that can't be recreated?  I believe that historically that has been the
biggest blocker to a "container" like object in the kernel.
