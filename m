I've completed the functional, stress, and A/B/C/D/E performance testing
on my side.

The results are consistent with the expected v1 performance shape, and
I don't see a significant performance regression for the full v2 series
in this workload.

I'm also reviewing the v2 code, particularly the allocation queue,
locking, and swapoff/lifetime changes. I'll follow up on the thread with
any findings.

Kunwu
