Agreed. The nodes: prefix was meant to keep source= a typed selector,
but I made the motivation and possible future extensions too long and
distracting. I will make v3 much clearer and shorter, and keep the focus
on source=nodes.

Thanks, this is a fair point. Sorry, I also made that earlier
explanation too long, so let me summarize the intended use cases here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/67fcd8db-269d-43f1-aea2-8c41165747d0@bytedance.com/

In short, performance, fairness and cost are all part of the goal. One
target is mixed DRAM/CXL systems where user space keeps each memcg near
its own DRAM/CXL resident ratio target, based on the workload's
latency/throughput and cost requirements. Another target is the case you
described below, where user space wants memcg-scoped reclaim to apply
pressure to the desired tier first, rather than reclaiming from warmer
memory on the top tier. This is especially useful when a memcg is close
to its memory limit and user space wants charge-reducing reclaim to
start from colder/lower-tier memory first.

Thanks for the example. It makes the problem much easier to discuss. I
will refer to it when reworking the v3 motivation, and will avoid
framing the issue as a generic flexibility problem.

Thanks again for the review and suggestions.
