>     request that arrived later started a new download of the same file,
>     which the user may have skipped for being too big.  debuginfod__misses
>     now records such a cancellation as a cancellation, the 's' message
>     says the build ID will not be fetched again in this session and the
>     debug message tells a cancellation and a server miss apart.  The
>     lookup entry is also now allocated and published by a

> What changed from v1 (060dccedab1617dc):
> 
>   PATCH 2/8, "perf debuginfo: Fetch debuginfo keyed by build ID using
>   debuginfod" [sashiko-bot review of PATCH 2/8]:
> 
>   - Included <limits.h> for PATH_MAX, that was coming in through a
>     glibc transitive include and fails to build with musl libc.
> 
>   - debuginfod__setup_urls_env() now goes through pthread_once, so that
>     the setenv() of DEBUGINFOD_URLS happens exactly once: setenv() is
>     not thread safe and this is on the fetch path, which
>     dso__debuginfo() deliberately takes outside dso__lock.
> 
>   - The fetch now runs with debuginfod__fetch_lock held, so that the
>     process global state it uses — the terminal settings, the SIGINT/
>     SIGTERM dispositions and the progress and cancellation state — is
>     only ever touched by one fetch at a time.  A second concurrent
>     fetch would otherwise have taken the first one's raw mode as the
>     state to restore, leaving the terminal broken when it was done, and
>     would reset the cancellation state from under the fetch already in
>     progress.  Serializing also keeps two fetches from racing for the
>     same keypresses and the same progress line, and a second fetch has
>     nothing to gain from running in parallel with a first one reading
>     the same kind of file off the same servers.
> 
>   - An interrupt that lands after the fetch already succeeded is no
>     longer swallowed: at that point the terminal and the signal
>     dispositions are the original ones again, so the signal is re-raised,
>     the same way the failure path does, instead of perf carrying on as
>     if the user had not asked it to stop.
> 
>   PATCH 6/8, "perf scripts: Add perf-stuck, to tell where a running perf
>   is stuck" [sashiko-bot review of PATCH 6/8]:
> 
>   - /proc/<pid>/stat is now parsed with the parenthesized command name
>     removed first, so that a process with spaces in its name no longer
>     shifts every field after it: watching a process named 'my sleep'
>     used to report "sleep)" as its state and a garbage RSS.
> 
>   - The CPU time is printed with awk's printf "%d" instead of relying on
>     its default output format, that switches to scientific notation,
>     which the bash arithmetic below cannot parse, once the sum of utime
>     and stime goes past six digits, i.e. some 16 minutes of CPU at
>     100 Hz.
> 
>   - The process can go away between the '-d /proc/<pid>' check and the
>     read of /proc/<pid>/stat, so the read is now checked: a failed or
>     empty one reports "process gone" instead of 'set -u' aborting the
>     script on an unbound field, which is what would have hidden the
>     very exit the script is meant to report.
> 
>   - The command line printed when the script starts has its control
>     characters stripped, so that a process started with escape sequences
>     in its arguments, e.g. one replaying a log line, does not get them
>     replayed on the terminal of whoever runs this.
> 
>   - The two pre-existing issues sashiko-bot raised that are outside the
>     scope of this series, the child entries and their hists arrays
>     leaked by the data type browser teardown and the missing <stdio.h>
>     and <stdlib.h> includes in ui/browsers/annotate-data.c, are
>     recorded as items 178 and 179 of the perf TODO list for follow-up
>     work.
> 
>   - Patches 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 are unchanged from v1: sashiko-bot
>     found no issues in them.

> Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo (12):

>   perf debuginfo: Fetch debuginfo keyed by build ID using debuginfod
>   perf config: Move perf_config__set_variable() to util/config.c

In general, I feel like AI generated patches are too verbose - not only
for the cover letter, it's about commit log and the code comments.  It
adds more burdens on the reviewer side.  Is it possible to guide your
agent to produce less messages with important informations only?

Thanks,
