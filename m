Not much, other than that hotplug is at least already serialised against 
perf_event_open on the perf core side via perf_online_mask. This is also 
where I was heading with my generic hotplug proposal[1] - once perf core 
can be in charge of that, it should then be viable to also migrate PMUs 
for reasons other than hotplug, and it would all look the same to the 
drivers.

(Yes, as-is my patch still preserves the status quo of drivers picking 
their own target CPU to keep things simple, but that was one of the 
points I was hoping to generate some discussion on...)

Thanks,
Robin.
