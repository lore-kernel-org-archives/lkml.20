I think the missing point is that DMA_FROM_DEVICE is not neutral for
bytes which the device does not write.

For an out-of-place request, the caller may have already populated the
reserved destination AAD area. The AEAD API says that this area will not
be written by the cipher operation:

  Even in the out-of-place case, space must be reserved in the
  destination for the associated data, even though it won't be written
  to.

With SWIOTLB, however, mapping it as DMA_FROM_DEVICE may leave the
corresponding bounce-buffer bytes uninitialized, and unmapping then
copies those untouched bytes back over the caller's AAD.

The API also explicitly permits the source and destination AAD entries
to describe the exact same byte range (and users do this in practice,
for example nitrox_rfc4106_set_aead_rctx_sglist):

  It is permissible for the "destination" associated data to alias
  the "source" associated data.

Therefore, this is a valid out-of-place request:

  src: [ AAD X ] [ plaintext P ]
  dst: [ AAD X ] [ ciphertext C ] [ tag T ]

P and C use separate storage. Only the two AAD entries point to the same
addresses X.

Safexcel currently maps the source list as DMA_TO_DEVICE and the whole
destination list as DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Consequently, X is mapped as device
output even though the accelerator deliberately does not write it. On a
non-coherent system or with SWIOTLB, unmapping the destination can then
overwrite X with stale data.

Thanks for following up.
