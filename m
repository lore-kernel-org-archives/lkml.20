Hi Mika, Bjorn, Lukas, Rafael,

Apologies for the very long silence on this.  I was out on an extended
vacation and then got pulled into other work when I got back.  I want to
spin v5 now, and before that I want to respond to some of the opens.  v4
was posted about an hour before Bjorn's v3 review landed, so none of that
discussion was reflected in it.

Quick recap for anyone paging this back in:

  On Intel Catlow Lake PCH Root Ports, the Root Status register (PME
  Status) is not reliably updated when the PME arrives.  The interrupt
  itself is delivered; IOSF-SB backdoor reads confirm the status bits stay
  clear, and nothing in BIOS or the kernel is clearing them.  So
  pcie_pme_irq() sees no PME Status, returns IRQ_NONE, and a hot-add that
  happens while the port is runtime suspended in D3hot is lost, because
  pciehp_suspend() has cleared HPIE and is relying on PME to bring the
  port back.

  v1 hacked pciehp_isr().  v2 called pm_runtime_disable() in the quirk,
  which costs ~10% PC6 residency here and, more importantly, doesn't help
  once the system suspends.  v3/v4 instead set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_PME_UNRELIABLE
  via a quirk and skip the HPIE clear in pciehp_disable_interrupt(), so the
  port still goes to D3hot but hotplug events arrive as ordinary hotplug
  interrupts.  Bjorn's objection to that is that eb34da60edee cleared HPIE
  for a reason, and we had nothing solid to say why Catlow won't hit the
  spurious wakeup that motivated it.  Mika's last question was whether the
  port enters D3cold at all.

It would return false - but we never get that far.  The affected Port is
0000:00:1a.0 (\_SB.PC00.RP25), and it has _PS0/_PS3 and _PRW, but no
_PR0/_PR3, no _S0W and no HotPlugSupportInD3.  With that, the first block
wins:

	if (adev) {
		if (acpi_dev_power_state_for_wake(adev) <= ACPI_STATE_D2)
			return false;	<-- no _S0W, so 0xFF; not taken
		if (acpi_device_power_manageable(adev))
			return true;	<-- taken; _PS0 alone is enough
	}

and the HotPlugSupportInD3 check that would have said no is unreachable.
So the shortcut added by c6e331312ebf ("PCI/ACPI: Whitelist hotplug ports
for D3 if power managed by ACPI", 2020) returns true before the
requirements added by dff6139015dc ("PCI/ACPI: Allow D3 only if Root Port
can signal and wake from D3", 2022) are ever consulted. 

Bjorn, I think the same data answers your concern.  In Mika's flow the
presence-detect toggle comes from PCI/ACPI turning off the Port's power
resource and asserting PERST#.  With no _PR3, D3cold is never valid, the
Port only ever reaches D3hot, PERST# is never asserted, and presence detect
never toggles.  That is a structural difference from the case eb34da60edee
was written for.

You also suggested keeping the workaround in pme.c, for instance calling
pcie_pme_walk_bus() regardless of PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME on quirked ports.  I
don't think that works, for the reason Lukas raised.  The Port's interrupt
is shared (hotplug, bandwidth notification, AER and DPC).  Without PME Status
as the filter, all of those would walk the bus and resume every device below
the Port to read its PMCSR, on every interrupt rather than only around
suspend.

That leaves the question of which direction to take for v5.  I see three,
and I would prefer the first.

1. Keep the v3/v4 mechanism (quirk plus skipping the HPIE clear) and
   justify it with the no-Power-Resource, no-D3cold reasoning above, in the
   commit log and in a comment next to the pciehp change.  

2. Go back to the v2 shape and keep the affected Port out of low-power
   states from the quirk, so PME is never depended on.  Bjorn, I think this
   is where your simplicity argument actually lands, more so than the pme.c
   variant above, since it touches no shared code at all.  What stopped me
   in v2 was not only the power cost.  pciehp_suspend() clears HPIE
   regardless of runtime PM state, so keeping the Port resumed still loses
   hot-add across s2idle, whereas option 1 covers both cases.

3. Make the HotPlugSupportInD3, _PRW and _S0W requirements apply to
   power-manageable ports too instead of being short-circuited.  That fixes
   this Port with no quirk at all, which is what dff6139015dc looks like it
   was meant to do, but it also takes D3 away from any port with _PS0/_PS3
   and no HotPlugSupportInD3, so I think it belongs in a separate
   discussion rather than gating this series.  I do think it is worth doing
   on its own.  Lukas, Rafael, let me know if you agree it is worth a
   separate patch.

Could you let me know which one you would like me to take?  If there are no
objections I will send v5 with option 1.
