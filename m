selftests: can: add J1939 wire-format tests against CAN_RAW

This adds test_j1939_wire, which pairs a J1939 socket with a CAN_RAW
socket so the CAN frames on the wire are checked in both directions. It
covers PDU1 (destination specific) and PDU2 (broadcast) single frames,
both for J1939 TX seen on CAN_RAW and for raw-injected frames received
on a J1939 socket.

> The base test only exercises J1939-socket-to-J1939-socket

[Severity: Low]
Is this description accurate?

Earlier patches in this series already look at on-wire CAN ids through
a CAN_RAW peer. raw_prio() in test_j1939_opts.c (from "selftests: can:
add J1939 socket option and metadata tests") decodes the priority:

    return (int)J1939_ID_PRIO(frame.can_id & CAN_EFF_MASK);

source_sa_on_wire() in test_j1939_addr.c (from "selftests: can: add
J1939 addressing and concurrency tests") checks the source address:

    EXPECT_EQ((int)J1939_ID_SA(frame.can_id), SA_TX)

J1939-to-J1939 traffic also does not take a shortcut inside the stack.
j1939_send_one() builds the full CAN id and loops the frame back through
can_send():

net/can/j1939/main.c:j1939_send_one() {
    ...
	cf->can_id = canid;
	cf->len = dlc;

	return can_send(skb, 1);
}

j1939_can_recv() then decodes the looped-back frame, so the base test
already exercises encode and decode. It only misses errors that are
symmetric between the two.

Could the commit message describe what this patch actually adds? That
is the PF/PS/full-PGN and payload checks for PDU1/PDU2, plus delivery
of injected raw frames to J1939 data sockets.

[Severity: Low]
Does this check how the kernel parses the source address or the
priority? The file header says an injected frame "is parsed and
delivered to the J1939 socket". However, recv_timeout() is a plain
recv(), so the sockaddr_can holding the parsed SA/PGN is thrown away.
Only the payload gets compared.

The RX socket is bound but never connected. j1939_sk_match_dst() only
applies the source address filter to connected sockets:

net/can/j1939/socket.c:j1939_sk_match_dst() {
    ...
	/* Source address filter */
	if (jsk->state & J1939_SOCK_CONNECTED) {
    ...
}

Suppose j1939_can_recv() decoded skcb->addr.sa wrongly (to any value
other than 0xff), or decoded skcb->priority wrongly. The payload would
still be delivered, and rx_pdu1_from_raw and rx_pdu2_from_raw would
pass. Wrong PGN or DA parsing would stop delivery, so those are only
covered indirectly.

Would it work to use recvfrom() here and check that
addr.can_addr.j1939.addr == SA_PEER and addr.can_addr.j1939.pgn == pgn?
The SCM_J1939_PRIO cmsg could also be checked.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this return an unrelated frame when CANIF is a real CAN interface?

FIXTURE_SETUP opens self->raw with J1939_SETUP_RAW(self, 0), which keeps
the default accept-all filter, before the J1939 socket exists. The first
frame it returns is assumed to be the one the J1939 socket just sent.
Nothing checks SA, PGN or destination before tx_pdu1_to_raw() and
tx_pdu2_to_raw() assert on its fields.

j1939_lib.sh supports non-vcan interfaces explicitly:

tools/testing/selftests/net/can/j1939_lib.sh:setup() {
	if [[ $CANIF == vcan* ]]; then
		ip link add name "$CANIF" type vcan || exit $ksft_skip
		created=1
	else
		ip link set dev "$CANIF" type can bitrate "$BITRATE" || exit $ksft_skip
	fi
    ...
}

If another node sends a frame on that bus, the PRIO/SA/PS/PF/payload
checks run against that frame, and the TX tests fail on a correct
kernel. A freshly created vcan has no other traffic, so the default run
is not affected.

j1939_tests.h already has a helper for this case. The comment in
recv_match() says:

	/*
	 * Non-matching frames (other traffic on the bus) must not refresh the
	 * timeout, or a busy bus would keep the loop alive forever. ...

Could this use recv_for_peer(self->raw, J1939_PF(pgn), da, frame, ...)
for PDU1, and a recv_match() predicate on the full PGN plus SA_LOCAL
for PDU2?

The same unfiltered pattern is already in source_sa_on_wire() and
raw_prio() from earlier patches in this series. This patch adds new
instances of it.

Also, the file header says "The vcan interface is set up by the caller
(see test_j1939_wire.sh)". The wrapper accepts non-vcan interfaces too,
so the header does not match.

[Severity: Low]
Does this cover the whole CAN id that the file header promises ("the
expected CAN id (priority, PGN, source and destination)")?

Both tx_pdu1_to_raw() and tx_pdu2_to_raw() mask with CAN_EFF_MASK
before any assertion, so CAN_EFF_FLAG (and RTR/ERR) are never checked.
j1939_send_one() builds the id with the flag set:

	canid = CAN_EFF_FLAG |
		(skcb->priority << 26) |
		(skcb->addr.pgn << 8) |
		skcb->addr.sa;

A regression that dropped CAN_EFF_FLAG would still pass.

For PDU1, the PGN check here only covers PF (bits 16-23). The DP and
EDP bits (24-25) are never checked. tx_pdu2_to_raw() compares the full
PGN with (id >> 8) & J1939_PGN_MAX, so the two TX tests check different
things.

j1939_tests.h already has j1939_canid(), documented as "Encode a J1939
single frame the way the kernel does on transmit", and send_raw8() uses
it on the RX side. Would a direct comparison like this cover every
field in both tests?

    EXPECT_EQ(frame.can_id, j1939_canid(PRIO, pgn, da, SA_LOCAL));
