Perhaps it is?  Here is the code:

	cmpxchg_release(&inode->i_link, NULL, pstr.name)

And inode is a struct inode, of which ->i_link is char*.  For its part,
pstr is a struct fscrypt_str, of which ->name is unsigned char *.

But this is either a 4-byte or 8-byte cmpxchg_release(), depending on
CONFIG_64BIT, which is orthogonal to this patch series, which provides
2-byte emulation.

Therefore, I see no reason to hold up these cmpxchg_emu_u16() patches.

But please let me know if I am missing something.
