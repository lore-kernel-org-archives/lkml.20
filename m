Ok, but this is not we have done so far. I don't think fixing the
predivier would break any use case, but if it does we may have to
re-visit this.

I see, you should have had a warning like that then ?

''' Zero divisor and CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO not set  '''

But from what I understand, your divider may have zero written in its
register but it will not output the parent rate unmodified, correct ?
In such case CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO is not correct.

Can you clarify the meaning of invalid ? If the just no oscillation I
guess we could add a 'CLK_DIVIDER_INVALID_ZERO' that returns 0 from
recalc_rate().

If your multiplier you'll probably have to handle this is
determine_rate() with something like

if (req->best_parend_rate =3D=3D 0 ||
    (req->rate / req->best_parent_rate) > YOUR_MAX_MULT) {
    clk_hw_round_rate(parent, req->rate / YOUR_MAX_MULT)
}

Then you update req->best_parent_rate with the value you get and CCF
will update the divider when the rate is applied.

If you then add your single entry table and CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT, it
should work as you expect AFAIU.

I don't like driver setting regs without a clear instruction from the
consumer or the framework, it is a splipery slope where people just tend
shove their use cases..

Please add the RFT tag. Please test GXL as well, you should have no
problem getting your hands on one, those are still easily available.

For Meson8, maybe Martin will be able to help us out ?
