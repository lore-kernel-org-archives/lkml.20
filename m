Right, because of that s390 treats all CPUs as equal and starts to
assign lower capacities to CPUs with low entitlement once a certain
steal time threshold is crossed (aka physical CPU contention).

IMO it should be dynamically adjustable depending on the contention
level. But yes, on worst case low capacity cores should be avoided by
marking them as non-preferred.

IIUC, find_new_ilb() finds an idle CPU that can do load balancing
for other idle CPUs. As long as the tasks don't land on non-preferred
CPUs, where ilb occurs should not matter. (At least for s390)

I think what Andrea has in mind is something similar to what he did with
select_idle_capacity(). Depending on the state of the non-preferred mask
and other factors cores and SMT siblings can be evaluated as ideal
candidate somehow. Wouldn't it be possible to extend the
infrastructure you introduced to achieve this?

I think this makes a lot of sense. An approach to first fill preferred
CPUs before spilling to the non-preferred cores until contention
forces the evacuation of non-prefered CPUs.

Shrikanth, would it make sense if I try to find a way to extend your
current implementation in this way?

Thanks!
