Hi Leo, Marc,

On the NV side, KVM itself already limits the L1-visible
ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1.HAFDBS to AF-only in limit_nv_id_reg(), so bit 51 has
no architectural meaning to L1, and an L1 using it as software metadata
would have its read-only pages misread as writable by the union read in
walk_nested_s2_pgd() — the memory corruption Marc described. Since NV
has no HAFDBS emulation today, I'd suggest we simply revert this hunk
for now and keep reading writability from S2AP[1] alone:

```
out->writable = desc & KVM_PTE_LEAF_ATTR_LO_S2_S2AP_W;
```

It seems we can address the NV side later, once nested HAFDBS is
actually supported.

That's what I did when picking the series up for HDBSS v5: patch 1 drops
the nested.c hunk.

Thanks,
Tian
