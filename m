These helpers are mostly used at run time, where the interface name is
useful, and during probe their messages still start with the driver and
USB device names. So I'd rather leave them as they are in this fix, and
clean them up later on, if needed.

Confirmed. v6 adds a new patch, "can: peak_usb: don't return an
uninitialized PCAN-USB CAN channel ID", which initializes args[]. The
PCAN-USB Pro and FD versions of this callback aren't affected.

Right, on a failed probe only. This is cosmetic, so I'll fix it along
with the teardown issues below rather than in this series.

Both are right, and both predate this series: CONNECTED was already
cleared before ndo_stop, and dev_exit() is only called at module
unload. They only matter when the adapter stays plugged in (unbind, or
probe failure), and fixing them means sending commands to the device
once its RX is stopped, which needs some care. I'll address them in a
separate series.

Confirmed: the restart URBs aren't anchored, and the PCAN-USB
restart_timer is never deleted. The window already exists on unplug
without this series, so I'll fix it in that same separate series, which
is about the teardown, rather than grow this one further.

Yes, fixed by a new patch in v6, see my reply to patch 8.

Thanks!
