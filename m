Sorry for the delay.  It's been a busy few weeks.

Agreed on both counts.

Since the PM bit in the Frame Control header is unauthenticated and
processed prior to decryption, an unauthenticated QoS Null frame can
still flip the AP's PS state anyway, so the AP-side change is best
treated as a spec-compliance cleanup.

You were also right to suspect the client-side TIM path in
ieee80211_rx_mgmt_beacon(), when (dynamic_ps_timeout == 0) (for instance,
when power-save is disabled on the client interface) and IEEE80211_CONF_PS
is not set, mac80211 currently ignores its AID bit in the TIM and never
sends a wake nullfunc frame to flush the AP's buffered frames.

If you're happy for me to do so, I'll send the following 2-patch v3 series:

 1. Symmetric PM-bit handling in ieee80211_rx_h_sta_process() (only
    consulting the PM bit on data and bufferable management frames, while
    waking sleeping stations on Auth / (Re)AssocReq as-per 9fef65443388).

 2. Sending a wake nullfunc in ieee80211_rx_mgmt_beacon() when the TIM
    indicates buffered unicast traffic while IEEE80211_CONF_PS is not set.

Does this help or hinder?  Your call.  If you decline, I'll go ahead and
close out our internal (Android) report as `Won't Fix` and move on to
something else.

Thanks.
