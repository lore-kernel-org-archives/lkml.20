Please don't put this here. The live update / handover stuff is going to
need very similar logic (see the RFC from Pranjal) and I don't fancy
having to rename or resplit this file when that comes along.

Maybe just stick all of arm-smmu-v3-kexec.c and arm-smmu-v3-kdump.c into
arm-smmu-v3-handover.c or something?

Can we at least check that they don't point at the kdump region?

This is an artificial restriction and not one that I'm wild about for kdump:
we should be able to support this for non-coherent SMMUs as well. Is there
anything more to it than using MEMREMAP_WC in that case?
