arm64 currently treats each bit independently for simplicity.  The main
use case I see for actually doing that is for preventing enabling writes
or pushes, though in practice I'd expect something doing locks to just
fully lock everything after having enabled the shadow stack.  We can compose
the features easily enough so it seemed most straightforward to just let
userspace decide what it wants, it keeps the implementation simpler.

Basically the glibc people weren't convinced they'd ever want to reuse a
shadow stack at which point having the kernel free and reallocate each time
is just as easy.  It saves having to handle corner cases with threads that
didn't exit cleanly.
