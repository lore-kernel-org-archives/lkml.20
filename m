Agreed. I'll change the guest driver so the lock asks the VMM for a
recollection with a nonce the driver picks. Each lock then costs one
recollection.

I don't have a use case for it. That was answering whether SPDM can
leave the nonce out.

Getting the lock event's evidence. With the suggested lock change above, the
guest driver collects it during the lock. But the lock is a sysfs write and
returns nothing. Userspace still has to read the evidence to appraise it before
run. The device was already locked when it was collected, so the read needs no
new collection.

Userspace doesn't need the expected nonce passed back. The guest driver picks
the nonce for the lock's collection and checks it before publishing. If userspace
sends a challenge instead, that nonce is its own. The collection's nonce is in the
evidence in the GET_MEASUREMENTS request that asked for the signature.

Yes. That's how wip_attestation_all_1 has it, and the device side is the SPDM family in the POC.
