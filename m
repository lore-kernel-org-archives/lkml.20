I'm fine with the approach you have here. I just want some more reasoning
in the description as cachelines can be quite large and so we need
to have a clear justification for people thinking of backporting the
change.

Too much cropping.  I had to go find what I replied to in order to
following the discussion! Put back above, indented as if you'd left
it there

Ah.  I'd missed that complexity and was assuming this was a normal
threaded interrupt handler.  One simplification here would be to stop using
async spi and instead just use synchronous spi in an interrupt thread which
is how most drivers handle similar flows.

yeah. I got this wrong in another reply I sent today. Indeed, the lock
is not conditional even though it acts like a conditional lock in the
outer call.  We need to be able to queue up multiple users of that
state on the lock so it can't be conditional wrt to mlock.

Added checking the existing places we grab the buffer claim to my todo
list for likely bugs :(
