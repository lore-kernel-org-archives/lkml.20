Have you confirmed the broadcast frames ate all of them?

The HIQ packets only send out right after beacon within ATIM
window controlled by REG_ATIMWND (0x055A). Can you try to
enlarge the size to see if it will be different?

If you stop 40 broadcast frames per second, will AP become available?

Is it possible to declare IEEE80211_HW_HOST_BROADCAST_PS_BUFFERING and
call ieee80211_get_buffered_bc() to get the BC packets to send?

I think it depends on which kind of packets get lost we can accept.=20

The vendor driver considers ARP, EAPOL and DHCP as important ones, because
user experience becomes bad if they get lost, but actually they have
their own re-transmit.

Consider multicast streaming, I guess it has error correction (like FEC),
so maybe it has more tolerant to handle packet loss. (I'm not familiar with
streaming, and no much experience with playing multicast streaming).

>=20
>   2. Or both, filter first and bound on top?

With the filter, I think it will not reason bound, because there will not
be much that kind of packets. Maybe, check bound first, and then filter ?

I think this is not possible, because USB needs time to transmit packets=20
from host to WiFi card, and then it needs to wait for next DTIM. Though
driver can prepare packets earlier, but it will be inaccurate=20
(still buffered in hardware HIQ).


As above, we have ATIM window, BC buffer in mac80211, HIQ filter,
and HIQ bound. But I don't have clear picture how to combine them to
deal with this case. Since you have spent time to dig the problem,
you may have more sense and better idea. :)
