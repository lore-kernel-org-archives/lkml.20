However, is this a platform you actually care about? Sparc is not 
something anyone runs dtschema validation on, so not all that important 
to worry about. Only someone with access to a system can actually run 
the validation anyways.

The priority is fixing the remaining warnings on arm64 (about 200 left), 
arm32, mips, powerpc, arc in that order of priority. I don't know that 
anyone cares about mips, powerpc, or arc warnings either.
