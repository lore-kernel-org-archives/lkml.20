nfsd4_cb_layout_done() polls a client that has answered CB_LAYOUTRECALL
and still holds layouts, and is meant to give up after two lease
periods: the recall then fails and the client is fenced. The limit is
computed from task->tk_start. The poll restarts the RPC task from
->rpc_call_done(), and rpc_exit_task() resets the statistics of a task
that was restarted there, tk_start included. So tk_start is the time
of the last poll, and the limit is never reached: a client that keeps
answering is polled every 10 ms for as long as it holds the layout.

Count the two lease periods from the first answer of the client, so that
the time in which a callback could not be delivered is not taken from
it, and take the time with ktime_get_boottime(), which goes on while the
server is suspended, as the lease times of nfsd do. A layout stateid is
recalled once in its life (ls_recalled is not cleared), so the time
needs no reset.

When the limit is reached, the existing failure path is taken. It does
not look at the result of ->fence_client(), so a SCSI layout client
whose fencing fails is treated as fenced there, and the layouts it drops
also end the retries of a fence worker that a lease break has started.
Before this patch a client from v6.8 on reached that path 10 ms after
the recall.

A Linux client before v6.8 answers every poll with NFS4_OK until its
LAYOUTRETURN is prepared (read from the code, not run). If such a
client does not return the layout, it was polled without end and is now
fenced after two lease periods, which is what commit 6b9b21073d3b
("nfsd: give up on CB_LAYOUTRECALLs after two lease periods") and
commit 851238a22f3b ("nfsd: fix error handling for clients that fail to
return the layout") set out to do.

Found by reading the code. The limit could only be tested together
with "nfsd: keep polling a layout recall answered with
NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID", because a current Linux client does not keep
answering a recall with NFS4_OK or NFS4ERR_DELAY: a client writing
through a block layout whose path to the device is cut for 70 seconds
while it can still talk to the server, a lease time of 15 seconds, and
a write to the file on the server. The recall fails 30 seconds after
the first answer of the client and /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed is run.
With the default lease time the limit is 180 seconds; a recall that
comes from a lease break is not waited for that long: after
fs.lease-break-time the breaker has the client fenced.

Fixes: 6b9b21073d3b ("nfsd: give up on CB_LAYOUTRECALLs after two lease periods")
