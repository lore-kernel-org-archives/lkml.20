Justin, I find your thoughts and perspective on this interesting.

First a general question:

If we understand correctly, your work is to enhance the capabilities
of LandLock.  You are fortunate to be in the kernel already and you
have at least a system call interface as a control plane and of course
the possibility of implementing a pseudo-filesystem interface if
something beyond the system call interface was needed.

Given that, what is the motivation for bringing eBPF and all the
assorted drama related to that into the picture?

In addition to all the political drama, eBPF signing is still a bit up
in the air as is the ability to completely lock eBPF based policy into
the kernel so an adversary cannot displace it.

The other issue with this work, seems best described as a problem of
'Mixing of the Blood', as it was once referred to in the Iron Triangle
country of south central North Dakota.

This effort seeks to merge two diametrically opposed viewpoints on how
Linux security should be implemented.  The camp that believes that all
security policy should only be implemented, and most importantly,
controlled through requiring inclusion in the kernel and the camp
seeking the ability to implement kernel based security policies
without years of contentious political struggle.

You raise the question above of as to why we should be forcing every
eBPF program developer to dump out a pile of Lego's and start stacking
them.  The reason is simple, it is the only way to move forward,
particularily in a timely manner, given how fast the security
landscape and challenges are advancing.

While work like this could undoubtedly benefit the Tetragon, Falco,
Tracee and others of this world it seems likely to run into issues
over whether policy should be in the hands of what amounts to
userspace.

Thanks for any insight you may have, especially with respect to the
advantages of endowing in tree LSM's with eBPF capabilities.

Have a good remainder of the week.
