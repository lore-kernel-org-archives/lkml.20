Thank you so much for your interest in DAMON, Lian.  But, the problem is that
my memory is so bad. :'(

I am maintaing mm patches review status dashboard for people who want to find
patches that waiting for their review.  It also provides the review status for
each sub-mm components [2] including DAMON [3].  Maybe finding patches that
waiting for your review from the dashboard is also a way for you?

If having the mail directly in your important mailbox is what you need, I
believe adding mails filtering rule for DAMON patches wouldn't be that
difficult.  If you use hkml, it could also help you monitoring [4] those.

Yet another systematic and long term solution that I could suggest is keep
reviewing and posting DAMON patches one by one, build more tracked records and
trusts, eventually adding your name as DAMON reviewer or maintainer on the
MAINTAINERS file.  All patches sent with get_maintainers.pl will automatically
Cc you.  It would take time and require patience, though, of course.

I really appreciate your interest and contributions to DAMON.  I hope it to be
continued long term!
