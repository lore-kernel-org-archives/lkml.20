Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Keep an already-configured bridge's bus number across a rescan
Date: Thu, 24 Sep 2026 13:41:15 +0800

When pcibios_assign_all_busses() is set, pci_scan_bridge_extend() assigns
a bridge's secondary bus number with

	next_busnr = max + 1;

This works correctly during the initial enumeration: the bridges are
visited in order, none of them has a child bus yet, and assigning max + 1
as each one is scanned yields sensible, increasing numbers.

A rescan is different. Bridges that were already present still hold their
child bus (dev->subordinate), and for_each_pci_bridge() iterates
bus->devices, which is built with list_add_tail(). A bridge that was
removed and is later rediscovered during the rescan is therefore appended
to the tail of the list rather than kept in bus-number order.

This is where the positional "max + 1" breaks down. A bridge that still
owns its old child bus can be assigned a number that another bridge is
already using. pci_find_bus() then returns the sibling's bus, the
"if (!child)" allocation is skipped, and the bridge takes over the
sibling's child bus while the sibling is given a newly created one. The
two subtrees end up swapped, and the endpoint behind the reused number is
scanned a second time.

If a bridge already has a child bus, it is being rescanned rather than
enumerated for the first time, so there is no need to renumber it; keep
the number it already holds. Bridges without a subordinate still get
max + 1 as before, the initial scan is unaffected because no bridge has a
child bus yet, and platforms that do not reassign all buses take the
preserve path earlier and never reach this code.

Reproduced on a QEMU RISC-V "virt" guest whose host bridge uses
pci-host-generic, so pcibios_assign_all_busses() is effectively true.
The machine has three PCIe root ports, each with an endpoint behind it:

  -[0000:00]-+-00.0
             +-01.0-[01]----00.0   (network controller)
             +-02.0-[02]----00.0   (NVMe controller)
             \-03.0-[03]----00.0   (NVMe controller)

Remove the middle root port and rescan:

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/remove
  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

Without this patch the two lower subtrees are swapped, 00:02.0 and
00:03.0 now point at each other's bus, and the endpoint that gets
enumerated a second time fails to probe:

  -[0000:00]-+-00.0
             +-01.0-[01]----00.0
             +-02.0-[03]--
             \-03.0-[02]--+-00.0
                          \-00.0

  nvme nvme0: Duplicate cntlid 0 with nvme1, subsys ..., rejecting
  nvme 0000:02:00.0: probe failed with error -22

With the patch the already-present bridges (01 and 03) keep their bus
numbers, only the re-added bridge gets a fresh one, the topology stays
sane and the endpoint probes normally:

  -[0000:00]-+-00.0
             +-01.0-[01]----00.0
             +-02.0-[04]----00.0
             \-03.0-[03]----00.0

Note the re-added bridge is numbered 04 rather than reusing the freed
02: renumbering only ever hands out max + 1, so once the preserved
bridges have advanced max there is no attempt to reclaim the hole. That
is cosmetic; the numbering is valid and no longer conflicts.
