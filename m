Yes, that's correct. user_events registration is initiated by the
application through the user_events interface, rather than being
attached externally to an arbitrary application like an uprobe.

So in this case the state being duplicated during fork() is state that
the application itself established. That's why I think propagating the
allocation failure back through fork() is preferable to silently
allowing the child to lose that state.
