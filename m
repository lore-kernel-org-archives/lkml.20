An old version doesn't add constraints to new version but new version allows
or not possible modification done by old version.

Focusing on property only, all libfdt version need to handle cases where a
unknown skippable tag is present.

A skippable is a tag with bit31 set to 1 and, by definition, has needed
information to skip related data.

An unknown tag is a tag not defined in the current libfdt version. It can be
in a skippable format but the current libfdt version doesn't known about the
exact meaning of the tag nor about the related data.

Also, we know that a skippable tag locate after FDT_PROP is related to the
property. So, even if the current libfdt version cannot determine the exact
meaning of the tag, it can determine that the tag is related to the property.

For the current libfdt version, we have a property and a skippable unknown
tag related to this property. The current version of libfdt wants to modify
the property. What to do with the unknown tag?

Rules are defined to handle this case:
 - First can I perform some modification in this dtb (last_comp_version_w compared
   against my last supported dtb version). If I cannot perform a modification
   I don't do the modification and report an error.
   This prevent old libfdt version (me) to do a modification because I am too old
   and I haven't enough knownledge to perform the modification.

 - Ok, I can do the modification. I apply the following rule known by all libfdt
   version:
     If a property is modify, related unknown tags are removed and the dtb version
     is downgrade.
   I modify the property, remove skippable unknown tags and downgrade the dtb
   version (i.e. set the dtb version to my last supported version).

That's the rule used by all libfdt version when an unknwon tag related to a property
is present. This rule have to be kept in mind when a new skippable tag is defined.

When the tag is defined we need to check if this rule is correct. If the tag cannot
be removed when the property is modified by old libfdt version, the new libfd/dtc
version generating the dtb blob must set the last_comp_version_w to prevent any
modification.


I mentioned only unknown tags for this rule. Indeed, if the tag is known (tag
defined at current libfdt version with a perfect knownledge of related data), the
problem is different. A property is modified and a known tag related to this property
is present. In this case, the way of handling the tag depends on the tag itself.

For instance, in the support for addon series. The FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE is added.
This tag identify a phandle at some offset in a property data.
When the property is modified, code in the series chooses to remove the tag only if
modification are done at the offset where the phandle is present. Otherwise, the
tag is still valid and there is no reason to remove it.

Now the question can be: Do we need a finer grain and use a flag per tag in
addition to the global last_comp_version_w field. We can imagine the following
rules for unknown tag:
  - First check last_comp_version_w with non semantic change (global write
    enable/disable).

  - Check the unknown tag value to see if the bit "Allow remove on modification" is
    set. If not set, do not perform the modification and report an error.

  - If we can remove on modification, modify the property, remove the unknown tags
    and downgrade the dtb version

This new "Allow remove on modification" bit, if it makes sense, has to be added in
the skippable tag format (alongside the data lengh encoding bits).

If such a tag is introduced, last_comp_version_w will be also set to avoid
old libfdt version (this tag is an unknown tag for old version) to perform
some modification.

Only version having knownledge about this tag can perform modification, probably
updating the tag data if a property is added or removed.

Ok, I will add a check even if this function is not part of the libfdt API.

There is no "known skippable" tags at this libfdt version.

Can you list them on you side?

You cannot. When you compile the library all known tags are defined in fdt.h header
file. In this libfdt version, no new tags were added. No new tags, no new "knwown" tags.

If you look at the addon series where new tags are added, known tags added
are handled to avoid the problem you reports [1].

If later more new tags are added, they have to be handled as soon as they are
added depending of the tag meaning, the handling could be different.

No, only unknown skippable tag for the moment.
There is no "known" skippable tag in this libfdt version.

New skippable tags added in future version are seen as unknown skippable ones
by older version.

At a given version, we need to remove all unknown tags and handle all tags
known at this version.

In this first libfdt version introducing skippable tag, no new tags are added.
and so all skippable tags seen are "unknown" tags at this first libfdt version.

dtbs_equal_with_tags will compare a binary against a binary.
Also, looking at the dtbs_equal_ordered(), libfdt function are used to get
informations. fdt_next_tag() is used.

I don't want to rely on libfdt to check that the binary blob is correct. I use libfdt
to modify the binary blob, using also libfdt to check it can hide issues.

What I would like is a tool to transform the binary to something more human friendly
without any use of libfdt functions and perform a diff between an expected file I can
check myself (human friendly format) and a dtb generated by the test sequence and just
converted to the human friendly format.

What do you think is wrong with this approach?

fdtput is used to modify the dtb and so trigger the rules when unknown tags
are involved. I see fdtput as a wrapper usable from a bash script. Nothing
more.

No similar tools were available for fdt_wip.c functions. I introduced wip_func
tools to wrap fdt_wip.c function and perform several tests consisting in
different fdt_wip function call sequences.
