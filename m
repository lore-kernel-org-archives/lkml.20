Subject: [PATCH v3 2/2] PCI: Allow 64-bit non-prefetchable BARs in
 prefetchable windows
From: Ard Biesheuvel <ardb+git@google.com>
To: linux-pci@vger.kernel.org
Cc: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org>,

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org>

The non-prefetchable memory window of a PCI-to-PCI bridge can only
decode 32-bit addresses, and so non-prefetchable BARs of devices below a
bridge can only be allocated from the part of the host bridge memory
space below 4 GB. This is the case even for 64-bit BARs, which could
easily be placed above 4 GB if there was a bridge window to put them in,
and on many platforms, 32-bit addressable MMIO space is scarce.

The PCIe spec addresses this in the implementation note "Additional
Guidance on the Prefetchable Bit in Memory Space BARs" (PCIe r7.0, sec
7.5.1.2.1): on PCIe, setting the Prefetchable bit of a BAR still permits
correct operation even if the range has read side effects or cannot
tolerate write merging, as long as the entire path from the host to the
device is PCIe, given that PCIe Memory Reads always carry an explicit
length, and PCIe Switches never prefetch or merge writes. The same
reasoning applies when it is the OS that places a non-prefetchable BAR
in a prefetchable bridge window: PCIe Root Ports and Switch Ports
forward requests that hit either window in exactly the same way. Hence,
the prefetchable window of a PCIe Root Port or Switch Port, which may be
64-bit, can serve as a 64-bit window for non-prefetchable BARs too. [0]

So add pci_bus_placement_flags(), which returns the flags of a resource
on a given bus with IORESOURCE_PREFETCH set if it is a 64-bit
non-prefetchable memory resource, the bus is not a root bus, all bridges
between the bus and the root bus are PCIe Root Ports or PCIe Switch
Ports, and the host bridge has no prefetchable memory window, but does
have one that extends above 4 GB in PCI bus address space. [1]

Evaluate the conditions on the bridges and the host bridge only once
per bus, when it is added, and record the result in a new bus flag,
PCI_BUS_FLAGS_NO_NP_BARS_IN_P_WINDOWS: pci_register_host_bridge() sets
it on the root bus if the host bridge does not qualify, child buses
inherit it, and pci_alloc_child_bus() sets it on the secondary bus of
any bridge that is not a PCIe Root Port or Switch Port.

Use pci_bus_placement_flags() wherever the resource allocator decides
which bridge window a device resource (including an SR-IOV VF BAR)
belongs in:

- in pbus_select_window_for_type(), which is used when sizing bridge
  windows, and when releasing them to retry failed assignments or to
  resize a BAR;
- when allocating the resource in __pci_assign_resource(), by passing
  its result to __pci_bus_alloc_resource();
- when claiming a resource assigned by firmware, in
  pci_find_parent_resource();
- when deciding which assigned resources to release after a failed
  assignment, and which failures are relevant to a resized BAR.

As a result, an eligible 64-bit non-prefetchable BAR is handled exactly
like a 64-bit prefetchable BAR: it is placed in the prefetchable window
of the upstream bridge, which may be above 4 GB, and allocation falls
back to the non-prefetchable window if the prefetchable one has no
space. [2]

32-bit BARs are not affected, and neither are bridge windows, as only
prefetchable bridge windows can be 64-bit. Devices below conventional
PCI or CardBus bridges, below PCIe to PCI/PCI-X bridges (in either
direction), or below host bridges that have a prefetchable window or no
window above 4 GB are not affected either, and neither are devices on a
root bus, as there is no prefetchable window for their BARs to go to.

[0] This reasoning does not extend to the host bridge, though: how it
    treats the windows that firmware describes as prefetchable is
    platform specific. For instance, the V3 Semiconductor V360EPC
    (pci-v3-semi) enables prefetching for its prefetchable window, the
    MPC52xx uses Memory Read Multiple for it, and Freescale PCI/PCIe
    host bridges (fsl_pci) enable relaxed ordering for it. However, if
    the host bridge has no prefetchable windows at all (as appears to be
    the case on many x86 PCs), all prefetchable bridge windows are
    carved out of its non-prefetchable windows, and so the host bridge
    does not treat them any differently.

[1] Placing non-prefetchable BARs in prefetchable bridge windows only
    helps if one of those non-prefetchable host bridge windows extends
    above 4 GB. Otherwise, the prefetchable bridge windows end up below
    4 GB as well, and BARs would merely move between two bridge windows
    that are carved out of the same 32-bit space.

[2] Note that this only concerns where a BAR is placed. How it is mapped
    is decided by the driver and by the attributes of the BAR itself
    (e.g., pci_iomap_wc() and the sysfs resource<N>_wc files only honour
    IORESOURCE_PREFETCH on the BAR), and this change does not modify the
    flags of any BAR.)

Tested on QEMU arm64 'virt' (DT, all resources assigned by Linux) with
a qemu-xhci below a Root Port, an NVMe below a Switch, a qemu-xhci
below a PCIe-to-PCI bridge and another qemu-xhci on the root bus: the
64-bit non-prefetchable BARs of the first two (and of the PCIe-to-PCI
bridge itself) move from the 32-bit non-prefetchable windows into the
64-bit prefetchable windows above 4 GB, while the others stay where
they were. When the 64-bit host bridge window is marked prefetchable
in the DT, or removed from it, all resources are assigned exactly as
without this patch. Both drivers work, also after hot removal and
rescan of the endpoints and of the Switch. Also tested on QEMU x86_64
q35 with SeaBIOS, which assigns all resources itself: the firmware
assignment is claimed as before, and after hot removal and rescan, the
eligible BARs are placed in the prefetchable windows.
