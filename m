Or finally, a real bugfix :)

How can vfio know that it can properly talk to any device like this?
Surely you have a list of real device ids that you know will work,
otherwise all bets are off.

It was never "best practice", you took a debugging option and somehow
thought it was a valid use case.  Yes, I'm being harsh but I am sure I
complained about this in the past and obviously never followed up on it,
so that's on me.

So what is the real use case here, taking any type of any device and
thinking you can bind a random kernel driver to it and it will work ok?
You all have specific platform and pci vfio drivers, why not use the
proper device ids there instead, or better yet, bake-in this type of
functionality into the bus-specific logic so that you can have generic
userspace control of a device (like usbfs and uio does today)?

We have real problems with random "bind/unbind" attempts that this taint
is here to help resolve as it was creating hundreds of false-positive
bug reports on developers all across the tree now that the fuzzers
decided to think this was a valid action to take.  Without this taint,
people were being forced to add hacks to all drivers for this which is
not an acceptable solution.
