I don't think so. The ready bit gets cleared when START gets raised, not 
when it gets lowered, so a missed edge wouldn't surface as an error. The 
poll would match the previous conversion's ready bit and a stale value 
would be averaged into the burst, so I forced one by suppressing the 
clear on START.

With the clear suppressed the set finds START already high, so regmap 
doesn't issue a write at all and no edge happens. All 40 reads still 
succeeded, but each one returns sixteen identical conversions instead of 
the usual spread, and nothing shows up in dmesg.

It also let me calibrate the probe, which I wanted before trusting a 
zero out of it. Probing the result register just after the rise, it 
counts the injected stale bits exactly: 93.75% with the clear 
suppressed, which is 15 of 16 because in the first conversion of a burst 
START is already low and still makes an edge, and 43.79% against 43.75% 
predicted when seven of sixteen are made stale. In normal operation 
everything it sees is conversions that have already finished, and once I 
subtract those out, what's left at 30 us -- which is where the poll 
first looks -- is -5.1e-3 +/- 2.9e-3 over 96000 conversions.

The two writes are never back to back anyway, since each one is its own 
transaction on an uncached regmap over the PMIC wrapper and the set 
alone takes at least 7.3 us. I also tried inserting a gap of 30 and 300 
us, and it moves the reading by under 0.06 LSB, with no poll timing out 
across about a million conversions.

Even though the vendor isn't necessarily what we care about, it also 
writes START 0 then 1 with nothing in between.

I don't have a datasheet figure for a minimum low time, this is all 
measured, so if you end up wanting a wait there let me know, v3 has a 
bit more context in the comment.

Nothing, and in v2 it didn't do anything -- read_channel() discarded the 
teardown's return anyways, so the value wasn't even used. v3 hands it to 
dev_err() instead, as mt6323-auxadc.c does on its own release path, and 
the accumulators are gone.

The 'if (!ret)' left in read_channel() are sequencing the next step 
rather than merging an error into it, and the teardown below it is 
unconditional, but if you don't want 'if (!ret)' at all, let me know.

I took it a step further and made both teardowns return on the first 
failure rather than attempting the rest. mt6323_auxadc_release() does 
the same, and so do twelve others in drivers/iio that I could find. One 
does continue after a failed write -- ltr390_powerdown(), but it's a 
void devm cleanup callback that logs each error as it comes, so it has 
nothing to return.

With this change, a failed write can leave the later bits set. The read 
still returns its value with the failure logged, and the teardown runs 
at the end of every read, so the next read of that channel clears them.

Yes, with clang on arm64 and gcc on x86_64 allmodconfig, W=1 clean at 
every patch in the series, and the codegen was correct: one mutex_lock, 
one mutex_unlock and a single ret in read_raw() with read_channel() 
inlined into it, and no path that takes the lock reaches that ret 
without passing the unlock. The only two branches ahead of the lock are 
the SCALE and default cases, and neither takes it. Still, I missed that 
cleanup.h wants goto and cleanup helpers to not mix, and I shouldn't 
have mixed them. v3 puts the sample loop into its own function, so 
read_channel() becomes setup, then a conditional burst and an 
unconditional teardown, with no label.

Ack. Admittedly I hadn't tested the 'goto out_teardown' path prior to 
sending out the v2, so I apologize. I have now tested it by injecting a 
failure into each of the helpers read_channel() calls. All five paths 
return the helper's errno, the teardown runs, and leaves every bit the 
partial setup wrote clear again, and guard() releases the mutex.

I also stubbed out the teardown as a negative control, and the same 
faults do leave the bits set in that situation, so the check can fail. 
The restructure is in v3.
