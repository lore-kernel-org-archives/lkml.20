Hi Ian, Peter, and community,

Hi Ian,
Thanks for checking in. On the tools side, I have the changes planned to =
address Adrian's comments (dropping the custom =
arch_perf_record__need_read() hook from builtin-record.c and removing =
event->count flow-control usage). =20
However, on the kernel driver side, I am looking for feedback and =
guidance regarding the right mechanism for draining the HTM trace buffer =
into the AUX ring after pmu->stop().

Hi Peter and community,
Following up on the discussion regarding the kernel driver side in this =
thread [1]. Requesting for recommendations on the design (specifically =
regarding handling post-stop AUX buffer draining for interrupt-less, =
firmware-managed hardware buffers via a workqueue vs other approaches).

Brief recap of the problem:
- Hardware constraint: PowerPC HTM is a one-shot, firmware-managed =
buffer with no hardware interrupts. Trace data can only be read =
chunk-by-chunk via hypervisor hcalls *after* issuing a stop hcall.

What V5 of the patch series did:
--------------------------------
In V5, pmu->read() did all the work:
- On the first call: issued stop hcall to freeze the hardware buffer, =
then called hcall to dump the trace data into the AUX ring via =
perf_aux_output_begin() / perf_aux_output_end().
- Subsequent calls: skipped the stop (already frozen), copied the next =
chunk, and advanced aux_buf->head.
- Set event->count to the record count written, or 1 if the AUX ring was =
full (-ENOSPC, meaning "retry"), or 0 at EOF.
- Userspace polled event->count via perf_evsel__read() in a new weak =
arch_perf_record__need_read() hook added to builtin-record.c; a non-zero =
count triggered another record__mmap_read_all() + retry.

Review from Adrian flagged concerns with this:
- Concern 1: pmu->read() issues stop on its first call =E2=80=94 a =
hardware side effect inside pmu->read().
- Concern 2: event->count is used as a flow-control signal (1 =3D =
"retry", 0 =3D "done") rather than a real counter.

Proposed design for V6:
-----------------------
1. pmu->read() will become a clean no-op.
2. pmu->stop() freezes the trace buffer, then schedules a =
process-context workqueue (e.g. htm_drain_work_fn) to pump chunks into =
the AUX ring via perf_aux_output_begin() / perf_aux_output_end().
3. Deconfiguration and cancel_work_sync() are placed in event->destroy() =
(at close(fd)), keeping AUX mmaps and buffers alive during the drain.
4. Tools side uses auxtrace_record->read_finish() to wait for aux_head =
to settle before closing event fds.

Queries:
1. Is scheduling drain work from pmu->stop() and synchronizing in =
event->destroy() an acceptable pattern here?
2. Releasing the resources (deconfigure) will be placed in =
event->destroy() (not pmu->del()), which fires only at close(fd) =E2=80=94=
 after cancel_work_sync() ensures the workqueue is done. The AUX mmaps =
also remain valid until evlist__munmap() at that same point.
   So the workqueue can call perf_aux_output_begin() / =
perf_aux_output_end() safely because the hypervisor buffer and AUX mmaps =
are still live when it runs. Is this reasoning correct, or does perf =
core free AUX resources (free_aux / rb teardown) earlier than =
event->destroy()?
3. If not, is there another preferred pattern in perf core that can be =
used for this case?

It would be really helpful to get some pointers or guidance on this for =
posting V6.
Please share thoughts or any suggestions on this.

Thanks,
Athira Rajeev

>>=20
>> Addressing the two concerns for V6

>> Concern 2 is straightforward to fix: remove all event->count

>>=20
>> Concern 1 is harder.  The query I have is:

>> then copy trace data chunk via perf_aux_output_begin() / dump trace =
data
>> / perf_aux_output_end()?
>>=20
>> The reason for considering this approach for HTM specifically:
>>=20
>> - htm_event_init() rejects all non-sampling opens with -EOPNOTSUPP:
>>=20
>>      if (!is_sampling_event(event))
>>          return -EOPNOTSUPP;
>>=20
>>  So perf stat, BPF helpers, and any other non-record caller get
>>  -EOPNOTSUPP at perf_event_open() time.  An HTM fd can only exist
>>  inside a perf record session.  The only caller of read(fd) on an
>>  HTM event is from read hook - HTM's own drain code =E2=80=94 which
>>  calls it deliberately, knowing stop fires on the first
>>  call.  There is no unsuspecting caller path for HTM.
>>=20
>> - After the first call, pmu->read() is a pure data-mover with no
>>  further hardware side effects.
>>=20
>>=20
>> Alternative: workqueue after pmu->stop()
>> -----------------------------------------
>> If pmu->read() having any hardware side effect is not right path,
>> the alternative I was proposing is a workqueue-based approach:
>>=20
>> - pmu->read() becomes a true no-op.
>> - pmu->stop() issues hcall stop operation to freeze the hardware =
buffer,
>>  then schedules a work_struct (say htm_drain_work_fn()) that runs in
>>  process context and drains the frozen buffer chunk by chunk into
>>  the AUX ring via perf_aux_output_begin() / perf_aux_output_end(),
>>  backing off on -ENOSPC between chunks.
>> - event->count is not used as a flow-control signal.
>> - deconfigure the tracing ( releasing the resources ) in =
event->destroy()
>>=20
>> Tools side:
>> - arch_perf_record__need_read() hook is dropped =E2=80=94 no changes =
to builtin-record.c.
>> - A custom "read_finish" callback in the HTM "auxtrace_record" polls
>>  auxtrace_mmap__read_head() until the AUX head stops advancing,
