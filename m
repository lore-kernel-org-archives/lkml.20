Ack, understood. Feel free to cc- me on that when you send it out!

Ack yeah understood! And it does support that fine :)

I added further reasoning about pKVM in the cover/commit msg in the respin
([0]) so hopefully that helps clarify from that sid eof things.

Ack yeah, then the series should hopefully work for you.

If you could test it and report any issues I'd be grateful! Thanks :)

OK cool, let me know if you hit any issues.
