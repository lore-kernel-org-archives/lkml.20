I should have responded to the v1 of this, but didn't manage to get to
it.  Sorry about that.

Let's first talk about what autosuspend is for: My understanding is
that it is there to avoid incurring the runtime PM suspend and resume
latency (and cost in terms of energy) in the cases when the device is
known or at least is expected to be needed in the near future.  IOW,
we want to defer the runtime suspend of the device because if it
suspended, it would be resumed shortly thereafter.

I'm not sure if that is always the case when a dependent device
suspends and its reference to the parent/supplier is dropped.

The core calls pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() for resuming devices under
the assumption that they are resumed for a reason and so it is likely
that they will be needed in near future, but I'm not sure if that
assumption can be extended to a child suspend case.  One might argue
though that extending it to the child/consumer resume case would make
sense.

The distinction between "direct references to the parent device" and
"usage accounted for by its children" is not clear to me TBH.

There are references to the parent device in both cases and it is not
like drivers can always expect all runtime PM references to come from
specific code paths updating last_busy.  There is at least one
reference controlled by user space (the "control" attribute in sysfs)
and dropping it may also cause the device to suspend immediately if
last_busy has not been updated recently.  How is this situation
different from the one related to child/consumer suspend?

So I need to be explained how commit 9bdbb1139ca1 ("iio: adc:
stm32-adc: add power management support") works because ATM I don't
seem to understand it.  It looks to me like the .runtime_idle()
callback updates last_busy for the device for which it is called, not
for its parent.

I'm not sure why propagating last_busy timestamps when dropping the
reference to the parent/supplier is a good idea.

Why is the child's last_busy timestamp suitable for the parent in the
first place?

Why isn't done when dropping the reference?

AFAIAC, you need to say much more than this to explain all of it.

And I'd rather not do anything like the above unless absolutely necessary.
