Similar to what Andy mentioned for the patch description being too verbose
/ detailed applies to a number of comments in the code.  Take another look
at those and see if the information provided is actually useful in providing
info someone can't see quickly from the code.

Thanks

This is probably unnecessary info. Can see it easily enough by looking at what the
code does.

Where there are only a small number of choices, we tend to prefer just
picking between static const data rather than doing dynamic changes.
Tends to end up simpler.  Any reason not to do that here (and I may
well have forgotten earlier discussion on this!)

This definitely isn't needed.   Obvious that a wait time must be rounded up

This last paragraph is useful to have.

Speed in places, sped here and SPD in yet more.  Good to pick a naming
convention then use it throughout.

I think only the 1st sentence is really useful.  The rest of the comment
pretty much follows through from that.
