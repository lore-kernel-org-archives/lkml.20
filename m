Changes since v7 are minor and described per patch.

I would really love to get this applied. Since there have not been any
reviewers lately, maybe it is time to put it into -next and see what
happens. I will be there to fix things. Or we just revert if it goes all
wrong. But Matthew is the creator of XArray, I tested this as much as I
could and I took the Sashiko reviews into account. I don't know what to
do else. But I can't continue fixing the real issues in the hwspinlock
subsystem unless this series is applied :/ Here is the old coverletter
for more details:

I will not add more functionality to upcoming versions of this series,
only address review comments. I do have a list of issues I still want to
fix in hwspinlock, but only once this series is applied. So, I hope we
can upstream this soon.

Renesas R-Car SoCs have their spinlocks inside a unit called MFIS. Up to
R-Car Gen4, there was only one MFIS unit on the SoC. Gen5, though, has
multiple instances and, thus, multiple spinlock providers. The spinlocks
are meant for specific cases (AP<->AP, AP<->RT, AP<->SCP...). For
development on these systems, it is helpful to have an overview of
registered spinlocks in debugfs. Also, for debugging the hwspinlock
core, it is helpful to change lock states from userspace to trigger
corner cases.  This series adds support for all that. The first patch
converts the subsystem from the deprecated radix-tree to the easier to
handle XArray (Thank you again, Matthew!). The second patch adds the
summary in debugfs based on the new XArray implementation. The third
patch implements the low level debug interface.

A branch for testing is here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/hwspinlock/xarray

It has been tested on a SparrowHawk board (R-Car V4H) with one MFIS
instance and an Ironhide board (R-Car X5H) with two MFIS instances.

Looking forward to comments.
