Having transitional states that don't last beyond build_dt_info() is
acceptable in principle, however:

  1) That leaves m->is_local and m->ref redudant after that point,
     which I don't like very much
  2) As of this patch specifically, that's not the case.  I don't want
     to have intermediate commits where this invariant is not
     preserved (it's bad for bisects).

That sounds ok, though I think I'll have to look at the final result
to be sure.  I would prefer 8 & 9 be merged together for
reviewability.  That said, the libfdt parts of the changes could be
split out into an earlier patch than the dtc parts to keep the sizes
smaller.

Ok, that works.

I don't think the extra detail really helps much - just "The tag

Right, I'm aware, just haven't gotten to it yet.
