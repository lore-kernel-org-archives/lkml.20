OK, I'll rev the patch to do this.

I'll leave these two items to Vasant.

Yeah; AFAICT all the skips of features are mostly symbolic and for 
consistency when this is enabled.

I suppose really we should not permit a blocking domain to attach to 
make sure it's a clear message what's going on.

I tested this on an APU that applies this.

Short answer: with PerfOpt enabled, moving the GPU towards a blocked DTE
has no effect -- the device keeps doing DMA as if nothing changed. This
matches Jason's expectation that the DTE is ignored entirely in HW for the
device once it is in the PerfOpt/identity fast path.

Longer answer below (I had an agent help do this check).

Method
------
To keep the normal driver bound and the GPU doing real work, I added a
small debugfs knob that flips the live DTE in place and back, reusing the
existing paths:

   clear_dte_entry()  -> V=1, TV=0, IR=IW=0   (same DTE as blocking domain)
   set_dte_entry()    -> restore passthrough

Note the AMD "blocked" DTE is V=1/TV=0, not V=0 -- make_clear_dte() keeps
V set, and TV=0 is what is supposed to block DMA. I confirmed the change
via /sys/kernel/debug/iommu/amd/devtbl:

   passthrough:  QWORD[0] = 0x6000000000000003  (V=1 TV=1 IR=1 IW=1)
   blocked:      QWORD[0] = 0x0000000000000001  (V=1 TV=0 IR=0 IW=0)

The write goes through update_dte256() + iommu_flush_dte_sync() + a
completion wait, so the IOMMU re-fetched the entry.

For a guaranteed IOMMU-routed DMA source I used amdgpu_benchmark test 1
(SDMA VRAM<->GTT copies). The GTT side is system memory, so for an
identity device it has to traverse the IOMMU DTE.

Result
------
With the DTE blocked (TV=0), SDMA still moved 2GB to and from GTT at full
speed:

   dma 1024 bo moves of 1024 kB from 2 to 4 ...  5890 MB/s  (GTT->VRAM)
   dma 1024 bo moves of 1024 kB from 4 to 2 ... 10922 MB/s  (VRAM->GTT)

(vs ~10-11 GB/s unblocked, i.e. no change). During the blocked window:

   - mem_target_abort (amd_iommu PMU) = 0
   - no IO_PAGE_FAULT in the event log
   - no SDMA error / ring timeout / GPU reset

I also tried to witness the GPU's DMA directly via the amd_iommu PMU
filtered by devid. The filter itself works (NVMe, in a translating
domain, shows ~120M mem_trans_total under load), but the GPU reads zero
on every counter -- mem_trans_total, mem_pass_untrans, mem_target_abort --
even under the 2GB benchmark. The GPU is the only identity device on this
system, so I had no non-PerfOpt passthrough device to validate the
passthrough counters against; hence I am relying on the functional
benchmark result above rather than the zero counts.

Conclusion
----------
Once PerfOpt is enabled and the device is in the identity/pt fast path,
the DTE is effectively ignored by HW: TV=0 does not block DMA. So a
blocking-domain attach would not actually stop the device while it is in
this state.
