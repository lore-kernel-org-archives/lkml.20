Hi Matt,

Thanks for v5, and for turning the suggestions around so quickly with
measurements to back each one up. Patch 8 looks good to me; a few
comments on the rest (appologies, I'm using Gemini to help me be
cleverer than I am):

Patch 5: I think Sashiko's report is right. With idx forced to 0 in
ProfileMe mode, a PCTR1 overflow still pending when an Aggregate event
is multiplexed out gets taken as a window close: it adds a bogus 2^20
to the count and emits a sample from a stale PMPC, possibly another
task's. That's the mirror image of the false sample the commit message
documents for the other direction.

In both cases the interrupt arrives for a counter that hasn't wrapped
since it was last written, whereas after a real overflow or window
close the counter sits just past zero. Could the handler drop an
interrupt when the counter hasn't wrapped relative to prev_count? It
would need some headroom: a counting event's period is 2^20 - 1, so
its counter starts at 1, and a real overflow, which leaves it just
past zero, would look unwrapped too. Capping left at half the counter
range, as armpmu_event_set_period() does, keeps the two cases apart.
That would fix both directions, and the caveat could come out of the
commit message.

Patch 9: Now that patch 11 drops DTB miss samples from cycles:p, it
may be worth giving retired loads and stores a data source too. As
PALcode fills the TB, an access that retired without a DTB miss trap
must have hit, so mem_dtlb =3D PERF_MEM_TLB_L1 | PERF_MEM_TLB_HIT. The
memory sort keys would then show DTB hits and misses side by side for
cpu/cycles,profileme/. LDA/LDAH and the ldq_u UNOP would need leaving
out, as they don't access memory.

Loads into $31/$f31 need care either way. As the comment in
do_page_fault() says, as of EV6 they're prefetches, which never fault
(or are suppressed by the PALcode). If a prefetch that misses the DTB
is dropped without a trap, they'd need leaving out of the hits too. If
it does trap, patch 9 reports it as a LOAD, where PERF_MEM_OP_PFETCH
would be more accurate. Running your one-word-per-page test with loads
into $31 would show which.

Patch 11: Kept samples still carry the full period, so with -F the
sample rate, and perf report's approximate event count, fall by the
killed fraction: to about a third on your mispredict loop. That seems
the right trade-off, and it's what IBS's swfilt does with the samples
it discards, but it may deserve a sentence in the commit message.

For the next spin of the tools series, alpha-profileme.py wants the
same PM_KILLED_BM check before it trusts TRP and MIS. Its example also
records instructions:p, which after patch 11 has no killed samples, so
the killed% and invalid% columns would always read 0;
cpu/instructions,profileme/ keeps them.

Two possible follow-ups, neither of which needs to hold up this
series. perf mem has no Alpha events yet; cpu/cycles,trapped/p would
be a natural default, or cpu/cycles,profileme/ if retired accesses get
a data source. And as the driver already works out the profiled
instruction's mode for the trap frame swap, ProfileMe events could
honor exclude_user and exclude_kernel by dropping samples, as IBS's
swfilt does, with PALmode counting as kernel. PERF_PMU_CAP_NO_EXCLUDE
is PMU wide, so event_init would then reject the exclude bits itself
for Aggregate events. That would let unprivileged users run perf
record at the default perf_event_paranoid of 2, where the tool sets
exclude_kernel for them.

Thanks,
Ian
