Why would they need to do that anyway?  What are you protecting them
from exactly?  Cheating?  Secret stealing?  Playing without a license?

This sounds like us going out of our way to enable proprietary software
to lock us down to protect their "rights" - DRM.

I guess what you're promising us is that "this way you won't be forced
to run crowdstrike and tenable and intune to be able to play these games".
But 1. I still prefer to say "then nobody *needs* to play these particular
games", and 2. I could just compile my own kernel with
competitive_session_create() being a noop, so you'd still be digging
around to make sure I didn't do that, right?

I think the closest you could come today is to run it in a
confidential computing VM like SEV-SNP/TDX.

Possibly, but the first objection you'd have to overcome is that
you are asking us to reduce our rights on the hardware and software
that we own.  E.g. not being able to strace to figure out what is
missing when the software isn't working - yuck.
