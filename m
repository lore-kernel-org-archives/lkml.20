Hi Yaxing,

Thanks for your work. To help review and validate this patch, I am=20
sharing the two programs below, which were generated with the help of an=20
AI assistant. I reviewed the code and ran it on my test system: without=20
this patch the reproducer triggers the stale VS-stage TLB entry, and=20
with the patch applied it no longer does.

The test consists of two cooperating components:

   - a host-side controller that discovers the QEMU vCPU thread TIDs,
     pins them to specific host CPUs with taskset(1), and synchronizes
     with the guest program over TCP;

   - a guest-side program that performs the memory operations that
     populate and then probe the VS-stage TLB entries.

Start the host controller:

   sudo python3 vsstage_tlb_stale_host.py --qemu-pid <QEMU_PID>

Build and run the guest program inside the guest:

   gcc -O0 -o vsstage_tlb_stale_guest vsstage_tlb_stale_guest.c
   ./vsstage_tlb_stale_guest

The guest program connects to the host controller on TCP port 12345
by default. With QEMU user networking, the host is reachable from the
guest at 10.0.2.2, and the guest program uses that address by default.

Both the host controller and the guest program can be wrapped in a
shell while loop to reproduce the bug repeatedly.

Regards,
Bill
