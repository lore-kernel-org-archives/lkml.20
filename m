Ok now I understand what you want to do, I just don't understand why.
Why it matters to turn off nohz_full on all CPUs when vCPUs run on housekeeping?

Do you mean that your database runs better when hosts CPUs are in nohz_full?
But how does this new interface help? Ie: why is it worse to have all CPUs in
nohz_full except the housekeeping rather than shutting down nohz_full
altogether?

Or to put it another way: why is it better to have either:

- all vCPUs on nohz_full host CPUs
or
- all vCPUs on ticking CPUs

And why does it hurt to have a single vCPU running on a ticking CPU.

Thanks.
