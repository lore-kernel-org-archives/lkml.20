Yes, I see it. Basically I did similar things to kselftest_cmd_args like things that
runner.sh did to kselftest_timeout.

Yeah, settings file can't cover every different parameter(maybe neither timeout).
So `cmd_args` in settings file is only fit for single test which needs special
parameter such as setting `test_range=1,976` for test_kmod.sh of bpf directory,
however other bpf tests can ignore the parameter.

I think you are right. I am also not sure the original intention as I just found
current runner.sh had the feature which can retrieve cmd_args from settings file.
This feature made me think it can be convenient for users who didn't want to
export `KSELFTEST_${BASENAME_SANITIZED}_ARGS` everytime they start one test.

Anyway, glad to recieve more advice whatever next step has more work to do or
nothing to do.

Thanks and regards,
