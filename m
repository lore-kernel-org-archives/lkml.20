== Motivation

guest_memfd is KVM's guest-first memory provider that was created for
CoCo VMs and will support all VMs.

Today, guest_memfd only supports the equivalent of anonymous
PAGE_SIZE-d memfd memory, and has a lot to catch up to (HugeTLBfs,
tmpfs, DAX, etc) since almost anything can be mmap()-ed and handed to
KVM in a memslot.

I'd like to find a generic interface that would fit different
providers.

== Overview

Think of guest_memfd as a permissions (shared/private) and
KVM-know-how layer wrapping memory allocated from some provider.

This RFC illustrates how a resource pool fd can be handed to
guest_memfd to describe how it should allocate memory.

I believe this is extensible to many different kinds of memory
providers. :)

I'd like to discuss this at LPC 2026's KVM MC [1]. See y'all there!

== How userspace will use this feature

Do one of these,

  resource_fd = fsmount();
  resource_fd = open("/root/of/mount");

Then hand it to KVM_CREATE_GUEST_MEMFD,

  gmem_fd = ioctl(KVM_CREATE_GUEST_MEMFD,
                  GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_USE_RESOURCE, resource_fd);

And then use gmem_fd as before.

== How to become a provider?

Implement this in the provider's struct super_operations,

  struct guest_memfd_provider_operations {
          void *(*attach)(struct file *resource_file);
          void (*release)(void *provider);
          struct folio *(*alloc_folio)(void *provider, pgoff_t index,
                                       struct mempolicy *mpol);
          void (*invalidate_folio)(void *provider, struct folio *folio);
  };

And the existence of these ops when guest_memfd accesses resource_fd
will determine if the provider is supported.

One requirement of this design is to allow new providers at runtime.

== Questions you might have

=== Why implement in struct super_operations?

It's one of the options to allow guest_memfd to find ops, and for an
RFC I think this requires the least new code and makes a simpler
illustration.

We would progressively add support for kernel-internal providers by
implementing guest_memfd_provider_operations, and loadable filesystem
modules can also implement the ops and be picked up at runtime.

Another option would be to have some kind of registry. Please see
changelog of patch 1 for discussion of options.

=== What if my provider doesn't deal with pages?

Frank and David Woodhouse [2] have use cases for providers that use
PFNs, and this is definitely something a generic interface must
support.

Here are some options I can think of:

1. Don't define .alloc_folio(), instead define .alloc_pfn()
2. Refactor .alloc_folio() to .alloc_pfn()

Either way, I think guest_memfd should still be the primary manager of
the memory.

=== Why have guest_memfd be the primary manager of the memory?

==== For folio-based providers

I propose we allocate the folios based on how the allocator was
configured:

+ e.g. for tmpfs,
    + Use mount page size.
    + Respect mount size limits.
    + Use guest_memfd mpol and fall back to mount mpol.
        + Gregory, now you can set mpol upfront on a mount! [3])
+ Use all the config that your provider has for allocation, reuse all
  those interfaces that your provider already has to do the config so
  guest_memfd doesn't have to reinvent those.

Once allocated, follow guest_memfd's rules on:

+ Tracking number of allocated bytes for this guest_memfd
+ memcg charging
+ Mapping into stage 2 page tables
+ Shared/private conversions
+ memory failure handling
+ etc

For the above split, I had the provider allocate, and then insert the
folio into guest_memfd's filemap.

I think of guest_memfd as the primary manager in the sense that
folio->mapping points to guest_memfd's filemap, which will allow
guest_memfd to handle memory failure by guest_memfd's rules.

Memory failure handling by guest_memfd's rules is something core to
guest_memfd. When guest_memfd supports huge pages, we'd like to be
able to split and only unmap the very page with a memory failure from
stage 2, which will keep guests running longer.

The provider can perform more handling of memory failure; we could
work out the ordering between guest_memfd and the provider.

Other than memory failure, there are other users that use
folio->mapping to determine what action to take. For now AFAICT
guest_memfd doesn't support those, but maybe it will need to in
future.

==== For PFN-based providers

For PFN-based providers, guest_memfd can be taught to store PFNs in
the xarray (like DAX does, perhaps?).

=== But my provider must be able to revoke memory from the guest!

I think that can be achieved with a bidirectional .attach(), where the
provider saves a pointer to the guest_memfd instance.

When memory must be revoked, it can tell the guest_memfd instance to
invalidate the page from everywhere. This has the nice benefit that
guest_memfd already respects the KVM MMU invalidation protocol, so the
provider doesn't have to learn the protocol.

== About this RFC

I chose tmpfs because I think it's the closest provider to the
existing anonymous PAGE_SIZE folios that guest_memfd supports.

The patches in this RFC was written with the help of AI and with many
edits from me.

This was built on top of Sean's kvm-x86 coco branch.
