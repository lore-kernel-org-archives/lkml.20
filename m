My understanding is that this support was added in March 2026 here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260303115720.48783-1-dakr@kernel.org/

Some busses had their own version of this, but the above series made
a general, re-usable solution available.

My reasoning was that i3c-tools has been around for years now and it may
be in-use assuming the UAPI from [1]. Adding MODULE_VERSION was a low
effort, compatible, and reliable way to keep using the same i3c-tools
repo (and accommodate a changed UAPI).

In any case, in Sam's thread [2], there is talk of moving i3c-tools into
the kernel's tools directory. That's the better solution, so I can drop
the MODULE_VERSION in future revisions.

Thank you,
Meagan
