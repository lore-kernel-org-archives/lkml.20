To calrify my opinion more, "caller's quota" feels unclear to me.  I hope it to
be more clear that it means "the quota that is passed as a parameter to the
function".

I'd prefer using the term, 'commit' instead of 'copies' for clarity.

I overlooked this part in the previous reply, sorry.  And thank you for adding
this detailed context.

Nice catch, I misunderstood Sashiko's point.  Thank you for catching this,
Karl.

Now I understand you added the comment for commit 60bd24f272d0.  I think Fixes:
should also be 60bd24f272d0.
