I note you dodge the actually difficult question of what this wrapper function
would look like ;)

So maybe like:

static int kvm_vcpu_load(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	int err;

	err = kvm_arch_allow_vcpu_load(vcpu);
	if (err)
		return err;

	vcpu_load(vcpu);
	return 0;
}

?

And I do like that you'd actually gate the right thing, I feel you on that,
obviously since this kind of predicate is what I started out with.

But I'm also looking to do the smallest possible thing here that fits the series
and doesn't preface it with a 'change how core kvm does something'.

But if Oliver/Marc feel this is viable then sure can go with it.

(Also naming is hard, kvm_vcpu_load()? do_vcpu_load()? maybe_vcpu_load()?
checked_vcpu_load()? vcpu_load_checked()? :P)

I'm not sure I really get your point here at all? :)

Why would it matter what people who are too lazy to go check the implementation
assume about an arch hook?

Yeah I mean, micro-optimising a path run on a costly startup operation seems a
little unnecessary? :)

It seems the convention is __weak but I'm not going to die on this hill.

(C type safety is something of a myth but I do prefer to try to have what
little protection it offers when possible :)
