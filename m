Yup it's illegal to set VMA_WRITE_BIT without VMA_MAYWRITE_BIT.

I'm not even sure how a driver would achieve that but drivers in general are not
permitted to alter VMA flags after map time.

Yup :)

Maybe tweak to 'CoW mappings might map anon folios that do not belong to shmem,
so perform a less efficient page table walk in this situation' or something like
that?
