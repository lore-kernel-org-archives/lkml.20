Ack. I have disabled both kexec (including kdump for now, more on that
below) and hibernate when RMM is active.

This has been addressed in v20 integration branch here :

https://git.gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/linux-cca/-/commit/0e697f0f3b2c11855192ae6e80d6036e9374ccef?file_path=arch%2Farm64%2Fkvm%2Fmmu.c#line_b12897615_A2307

Ack. We could add that in later series. For now we block all kexecs.
