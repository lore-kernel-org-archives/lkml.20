Ah, because that function if you pass NULL to it, it doesn't mean no
string, it means no clock.

Reading the docs, this has to be 1, you have two clocks?

Not sure why you skipped this and skipped explaining why you are
consuming your own clocks.

This is a binding from the age of antiquity, using it to justify your
use is actually harming your argument rather than helping. Your clock
consumers should be providing the information about what the rate should
be, and if you need to do this in dt you can use assigned-clock-rates.

Same applies here as to the clock names fwiw.

Yeah, after more thought this should not be done like this at all,
especially if these filters the phandle point to are part of this device
itself, which I suspect they are. If that's the case, you don't need
phandles to even do this, you just need an int that says what N is.

So, looking at the docs and a brief chat with Jonathan about this
device, I believe you've got things backwards and this is actually the back=
end,
and the adc should be the one populating the io-backends property
pointing to this device. You should have io-backend-cells, and I assume
that there should be a cell for the adc to select which dlft it is connected
to.

I think all of these child nodes should just get deleted - all your
devices here seem completely fake, since you've got stuff that's only a
single word wide. With that, you could also throw away these mickey
mouse nodes with sound-dai-cels of 0, and use 1 instead, with that cell
again determining which dlft is in use.

The only child node I can really thing of any justification for here is
channels - albeit not adc channels since this is not an adc - so that
you can individually configure a dlft using those channel nodes.

These serial inputs, what is the source for the data that is ever
actually sent there? I am assuming it's effectively another IIO device,
just not the onboard adc? Are the outputs exposed on pins on the
package?

I would encourage you to remodel this system, where this device is the
backend and also try to get rid of as much of the consuming your own
clock as possible. Certainly consuming ker_clk should never be required.
It's hard to reason about what should happen with the serial interface
clocks, when I have no idea what the input/data source device actually
is in those cases. Being a clock controller does make sense, because the
device exposes CCK0/1 to the outside world, it's the internal routing to
the SITF blocks that I am not sure how to deal with. A ouroboros device
that is consuming a clock it provides is not really a done thing,
hopefully the IIO guys can tell you how these kinds of things are
typically done here, since I'm sure there's plenty of other devices
that have some sort of ability to change the clock source for a channel.

Probably you need to add two optional input clocks to this device, since
mdf_cck0/1 can be inputs too?

Let me know if any of this feedback is intractable stuff, and maybe hang
on for someone like David or Jonathan to provide some review before
going about a significant rework. It's worth bearing in mind that I am a
binding reviewer and not a domain expert in ADCs etc.

Thanks,
Conor.
