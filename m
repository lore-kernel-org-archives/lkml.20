Will send libgcc and CRIU patches for this.

I'll have an AI scan through all Debian repo sources to see if anyone
is doing naughty sigreturns. Even if so, if we evolve the user shstk
ABI, it might be worth breaking that (via opt-in arch_prctl), if it
helps with security.

Conceptually, I think shadow stack should authenticate all return
addresses placed on the stack. %rip in the signal frame is a return
address for any non-crazy use, but it's not authenticated. And IMHO that
should be fixed.

Unfortunately my patches fall short of plugging that gap, so I agree
they don't have a security benefit.

I'm eager to fix it and authenticate sigreturn rip, provided you think
it's worth doing.
