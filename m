The design doc still describes the old tier and promotion model:

- Tiers are no longer order_base_2() of the file descriptor accesses.
  A folio's tier is derived from its referenced count, which counts
  accesses from both page tables and file descriptors.

- A young PTE no longer always promotes a folio to the newest
  generation.  The first access only moves a folio one generation
  forward if it is at the tail of its LRU, i.e., in one of the two
  oldest generations of its type, a second access promotes it, and
  executable file folios are promoted on their first access.

- The eviction no longer uses the first tier as the only baseline.
  The type is selected by comparing all tiers of each type, and a tier
  is protected by comparing it against the tiers below it.

Update the aging and eviction sections accordingly.

 There are two conceptually independent procedures: the aging and the

 Eviction
 --------
 The eviction consumes old generations. Given an ``lruvec``, it
 increments ``min_seq`` when ``lrugen->folios[]`` indexed by
-``min_seq%MAX_NR_GENS`` becomes empty. To select a type and a tier to
-evict from, it first compares ``min_seq[]`` to select the older type.
-If both types are equally old, it selects the one whose first tier has
-a lower refault percentage. The first tier contains single-use
-unmapped clean pages, which are the best bet. The eviction sorts a
-page according to its gen counter if the aging has found this page
-accessed through page tables and updated its gen counter. It also
-moves a page to the next generation, i.e., ``min_seq+1``, if this page
-was accessed multiple times through file descriptors and the feedback
-loop has detected outlying refaults from the tier this page is in. To
-this end, the feedback loop uses the first tier as the baseline, for
-the reason stated earlier.
