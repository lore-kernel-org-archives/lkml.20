Hi Rajan,

many thanks for putting this together, especially for really going deep 
into the problem, and trying to sort out the messy ID scheme that 
Allwinner employs here.

Jumping straight to the questions you asked below:

So I read about the 1.6GHz somewhere, might just be a marketing claim 
about some max frequency. If the common speedbins do not support 1.6GHz, 
that's fine, but apparently some do, so I'd keep them in, for people who 
happen to have those SoC revisions.

I don't think we have ever seen A100s in the wild really, reportedly 
they got phased out very early in favour of the better performing A133. 
A100 is just used as a name because it was the only name back then when 
support was upstreamed, and in the kernel we tend to not care too much 
about vendors' marketing and naming strategies too much ... ;-)
I think if we can be sure that the current mainline OPPs still apply 
with this series, that's good enough.

Regarding 1008 MHz: This was just some frequency close to 1GHz picked by 
U-Boot, that should be low enough to not cause any trouble, even with 
the default voltage. How critical is this "unlisted initial frequency" 
message? If it causes trouble, we can add a made-up 1008MHz OPP with 
some safe voltage, otherwise I'd say we just leave it.

We simply do not support non-mainline firmware, both TF-A and U-Boot, 
with a mainline kernel. For older SoCs they were just not compatible, 
but I don't know about the exact situation with newer parts.
So like for the H616, please just use the SoC ID call, that's a clean 
solution. Maybe just make sure that it can fail somewhat gracefully 
(read: not crash).

I have just read that the "P" allegedly stands for "performance", and 
this it can clock up to 1.8 GHz. So again, just use what the BSP OPP 
table tells us. We are in no position to qualify enough parts to make 
such a decision. And we can always extend the table later should new 
data appear.
I think some of those handheld gaming consoles use the A133P variant? 
Maybe there are some tables in "their" source code?

Thanks, I will try to get those logs, I have the Liontron board and the 
Teclast tablet.

Thanks,
Andre

P.S. Since you mention the KickPi: can you please work with Paul (in 
CC:) to upstream the DT for this board? Seems to be one of the more sane 
and available devices with this SoC. I think Paul has plans to submit 
DTs upstream, but I guess he will be happy to have taken some load off 
his chest on this.
