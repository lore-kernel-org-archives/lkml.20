I'm not offended by the words, I'm offended by your tone. As BPF was
insufficient when RV started, it obviously wasn't a mistake that we didn't
use it. If you are just going to say it was a mistake because we didn't
modify BPF to suite our needs (which I highly doubt you would have wanted
to help us, as you already stated that you don't care about this project),
then you are obviously biased against us.

Your response was fine until you through in that last sentence. As making a
mistake means that the other non-mistake option was viable at the item. It
wasn't.

Look, if BPF has changed so much that it could be re-evaluated to see if it
suits the needs of RV, then sure. We could look into doing that. Perhaps it
can replace the hard-coded monitors. But what we have been doing has not
been a mistake. Saying so is a bit disrespectful to the project and a
direct insult to Daniel.
