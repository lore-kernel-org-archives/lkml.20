Oh yes, I missed that point.

(2) The version is always downgrade on any changes (modification, addition,
    deletion of a property or a sub-node) even if no tags are removed.
    Indeed the modification done (even a property or sub-node deletion) can
    requires certain tags in the later version.
    Downgrading the version on all changes is the way to state that the
    resulting dtb may be no more compliant with the later version.

Hum ok, let be conservative and remove the note (4).

The updated note (2) handles all modification. On any changes with and without
tag removal, the version is downgraded.

Also this note (5) will be updated

(5) All property modifications done outside libfdt using directly the
    property data pointer will not lead to any unknown tag removal nor
    a version downgrade.

Is it better?
