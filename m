I've given this a go, and (with some ugly typeof() casting) something 
like this works:

---
#define rounddown_pow_of_two(n)				\
	__builtin_constant_p(n) ? (			\
		((typeof(n)1UL << ilog2(n)) :		\
		(sizeof(n) <= 4) ?			\
			1UL << (fls(n) - 1) :		\
			(typeof(n))1UL << (fls64(n) - 1)\
)
---

Unfortunately, there are enough random places where the function 
__round{up,down}_pow_of_two() is called directly that it's turning this 
into a more involved series than I'd want to push through for a simple fix.

I'll re-send patch 2 in it's original form (without the helper changes) 
so we can at least fix the buddy allocator breakage, and then put 
together a more complete version of this series with all of the various 
callsite fixes, and a KUnit test to verify it works properly across both 
32-bit and 64-bit values.

My quick look suggested that gcc and clang were not doing anything 
excessively stupid here. The only really dubious case was for the 
roundup variant, which does end up doing the 64-bit subtraction. That 
being said, I wasn't able to come up with anything significantly better 
(particularly given that we're already pretty register constrained).

Regardless, I'll take another look at this before sending the full series.
