Eh, I'm with Xiaoyao.  Yeah, *ideally* we'd magically enable everything everywhere
all at once.  In reality, different VM types are going to support features at
different times.  More importantly, as Xiaoyao points out below in #1, unless we
enable everyting in a single patch, which is probably a terrible idea in most cases,
we'll still end up with staged/progressive enabling, i.e. we still need to have
patches that selectively enable and advertise a feature only for the VM types
that actually support the feature.

This is all quite similar to Intel and AMD feature enabling being done at different
times.  The biggest difference is that Intel and AMD are mutually exclusive and
so KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID always reports the correct information, but TDX already
provides KVM_TDX_CAPABILITIES, so AFAICT we still get accurate reporting for TDX,
just in a slightly different way.

Yep.  If there are actual decisions to be made, versus simply adhering to the
architecture, then we'll need to incorporate the needs/abilities of flavors of
VMs KVM supports.  But for feature virtualization where right vs. wrong is
dictated by hardware specs, there really isn't anything we can do in KVM to affect
the guest-visible behavior (beyond things like performance characteristics, but
those aren't ABI in any case).
