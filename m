We'll need some data but looking at the discussion thread [1]:

If the data still shows that the cost is still "dozens of pages"
for a few buckets w/o measurable performance overhead, I think that's
certainly doable.

Having both "Specifying __GFP_DMA for slab caches without SLAB_DMA is
illegal" and "However kmem_buckets is an exception because creating
separate buckets for SLAB_DMA is costly" in mind is confusing and
easy to get wrong...

Perhaps the user should bypass kmem_buckets and fall back
to kmalloc?

Making kmalloc tightly coupled with DMA alignment requirement was
a mistake, and now it's too late to fix that. It's better to not
repeat the same mistake again?
