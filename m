Ah. I missed the TCG_EK_Credential_Profile specification which defines
the NV index value for EK certificate:

2.2.1.4 Low Range
  The Low Range is at NV Indices 0x01c00002 - 0x01c0000c.
    0x01c00002 RSA 2048 EK Certificate
    0x01c00003 RSA 2048 EK Nonce
    0x01c00004 RSA 2048 EK Template
    0x01c0000a ECC NIST P256 EK Certificate
    0x01c0000b ECC NIST P256 EK Nonce
    0x01c0000c ECC NIST P256 EK Template

But, do we need some argument to get which EK certificate to get?
(RSA or ECC NIST P256)?

Otherwise, Is this interface going to print all EK certificate
regardless of alg?

Acked.
