I felt it was important to show some support for Fan, especially as
your comments came across (at least to me) as particularly harsh.  The
strong reactions in your latest comment only served to underscore my
concern.

As I said before, (emphasis now added for claification) "... *if* it
causes IPE or existing IPE uses a lot of pain ...".  I intentionally
did not make a claim either way.  Once again, I wanted to provide Fan
some support in case there was an issue and he found himself in a
position where he had to push back to preserve IPE's model.

I think we can all agree that upstream kernel development can be
difficult at times, and not just because of the technical challenges.
Working in the security/ space also carries its own struggles beyond
that.  It has been my experience that having someone stand up and show
support can sometimes help make that a little bit easier.

Perhaps that was not your intent, but that is how I read your "Please
don't start breaking an established pattern that works well." comment.
I believe that is a reasonable interpretation.

I'm unclear on your comments above.  Obviously out-of-kernel-tree BPF
LSM code is free to implement whatever it wants within the bounds of
the BPF constraints/APIs, that was the intent behind my "implement
whatever they please" comment.  I guess I could have made it more
clear, but it didn't occur to me that this would be a controversial
statement since it is already happening today ... ?

That wasn't clear from your earlier comments, especially considering
your tone, but it's good to have that understanding now.

> defensive about this.

As mentioned above, I wasn't speaking for Fan, I was speaking in
support of Fan ("... the decision of how IPE uses an IPE keyring is up
to Fan.").  Perhaps you didn't intend your comments to be received as
overly harsh, but in my opinion they had the hallmarks of anti-LSM
bullying that I've seen far too much of over the years and I wanted
Fan to know that at least he had my support to make whatever decision
he felt was necessary.
