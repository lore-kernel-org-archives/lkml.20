Got the performance numbers here. 
I tested both the case where all PTEs are dirty, and the case that 50% of 
the PTEs are dirty.

For that test, actually patch #5 could make kvm_pgtable_stage2_wrprotect() 
slower, which is counter-intuitive, in all platforms tested:

When we walk the S2 pagetable to wrprotect, using the new walker, the 
write to the PTE itself is so cheap* that the cost of the branch 
misprediction (write PTE or not) for the 50/50 case is significantly higher 
than the cost of the 50% extra writes, which makes the 50/50 up to 60% 
slower than the 100% dirty case. It is still slower in the '25% dirty' as 
well, and starts to get even at '10% dirty'. 

* (non-atomic, everything is in order, walker is small, cpu will probably 
bundle it all in a single cacheline write) 

Since the idea of patch #5 was to reduce PTE writes in the first wrprotect 
walk, it becomes faster only if only a small portion (<10%) of the VM was 
write-faulted while the remaining was read-faulted, which seems to be a 
really reduced audience.

Since this comes with increased complexity, and also carry costs of 
having HAFDBS itself enabled outside dirty-tracking, I don't think it's a 
good idea to further pursue patch #5. It's only value is that it served as 
a base for HDBSS implementation.

Thanks for reading!
Leo
