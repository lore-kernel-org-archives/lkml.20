The previous patch resends a layout recall once when the client answers
NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT before it can have processed the reply to the
LAYOUTGET, which covers a client that takes the reply in within two
seconds. RFC 8881 section 2.10.6.3 has the server name the request that
created the state in the referring call list of the callback instead, so
that the client can hold the callback back until it has processed the
reply, and section 12.5.5.2.1, which is about this race, lets the server
name the LAYOUTGET in a CB_LAYOUTRECALL. Commit 4f3c8d8c9e10 ("NFSD:
Implement CB_SEQUENCE referring call lists") added the lists, noting
that layout recalls need them, and "NFSD: Send referring calls with
CB_RECALL" [1] uses them for delegations.

Do the same for layouts: nfsd4_cb_layout_prepare() names the LAYOUTGET
that the previous patch records as a referring call, unless the client
had retired its slot when the recall was sent. The resend keeps the list
without testing the slot again: a client that has not processed the
reply yet holds the recall back, and one that has finds the call
complete. The Linux client holds a callback back with "NFSv4.1: Return
NFS4ERR_DELAY when a referring call wait times out" [2]. Without that,
it waits half a second for the LAYOUTGET, then answers as before, and
the resend still covers it when it takes the reply in within about three
seconds: half a second of waiting, the two second delay, and half a
second again.

Only the last LAYOUTGET of a layout stateid is named. That departs from
RFC 8881 section 2.10.6.3, which says that recalls MUST carry every
request that created the state for as long as its slot has not retired.
The recall is misread only for a layout stateid the client does not know
yet, and such a layout stateid was created by a single LAYOUTGET:
nfsd4_preprocess_layout_stateid() makes a new layout stateid for each
LAYOUTGET that presents another kind of stateid, and the client cannot
use the layout stateid before it has the reply. For a layout stateid the
client knows, the Linux client takes the seqid of the recall as given
once the named LAYOUTGET is complete, since
commit dce72920c81b ("NFSv4.1: if referring calls are complete, trust
the stateid argument"), and a reply to an earlier LAYOUTGET that arrives
after the recall is not used, because its seqid is below the barrier the
recall sets (pnfs_layout_stateid_blocked()). One referring call is also
all that cb_sequence_enc_sz has room for. ->prepare runs once per layout
stateid, which is recalled at most once, so the list holds one call and
is freed with the layout stateid.

This needs the referring call lists, which are in v6.16, and [1], which
is queued for v7.4. It should not go to kernels without
commit f52792f484ba ("NFSD: Enforce timeout on layout recall and
integrate lease manager fencing"), which is in v7.1: a client that holds
the recall back with NFS4ERR_DELAY while it takes the layout in can need
a GETDEVICEINFO for that, and before v7.1 a lease break that holds every
nfsd thread does not give up, so that GETDEVICEINFO would never be
served. From v7.1 on, that case stalls the server for the client until
fs.lease-break-time and then has the client fenced, where the client
would have lost the data before.

With the test of the previous patch and its one second delay, this patch
lost no block (23 and 23 blocks, the recall overtaking the reply of
each). With [2] on the client and the next patch as well, which does not
act in this test as the lease breaks come from the other client, no
recall was answered before the client had taken the LAYOUTGET reply in
(19 and 23 blocks): the client held each one back. With a delay of four
seconds, longer than the resend covers, a client without [2] loses every
block whose reply the recall overtakes, with this patch as with the
previous one: 15 of 15 in each of two runs here, 7 and 8 of 15 with the
previous patch alone, where each such recall is about a second shorter
and the NFSv4.0 client was done after 29.0 and 31.5 seconds, so later
blocks met no recall. With [2] and the whole series, none (8 and 9
blocks). For a client without [2], this patch saves the two second
resend when the client processes the reply within half a second, and
the data when it does so in two to about three seconds; it adds half a
second to each such recall when the client takes half a second to two
seconds, as in the test above, and a second when it takes longer than
about three seconds.

The cost is on the writer that breaks the lease. A recall that names a
LAYOUTGET the client has not processed within half a second now lasts at
least two and a half seconds: half a second of waiting on the client,
then the two second delay before nfsd sends the callback again, after
NFS4ERR_DELAY in CB_SEQUENCE with [2] or as the resend without it.
WRITEs through the metadata server get NFS4ERR_DELAY meanwhile. With the
one second delay, the NFSv4.0 client wrote only 71 and 76 of its 600
blocks in 62 seconds with this patch, against all of them in 15.0 and
15.3 seconds without the series and in 37.8 and 51.9 seconds with the
previous patch alone. It needs about 15 seconds plus two and a half
seconds for each recall that meets an unprocessed reply, two with the
previous patch alone. The number of such recalls varies between runs of
the same code; here there were 23 in each run, one for every LAYOUTGET
granted. In six runs with this patch and six with the whole series,
which behaves the same in this test, there were 23 or 24 in eight, and
the NFSv4.0 client wrote 6 to 76 blocks in a minute; 2 to 13 in the
other four, and it finished in 20.3 to 49.1 seconds. With the previous
patch alone, there were 1 to 18 in six runs, and it finished in 17.2 to
51.9 seconds.
