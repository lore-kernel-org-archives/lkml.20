Hmm, no, I don't think unconditionally clearing the filter is the right
thing to do. See below.

This is a good question. Maybe Felix knows?

Regardless, of your alternatives:

I think 2. makes the most sense. In fact, AFAICT, there is currently
*no* software retry logic for non-aggregated frames in ath9k? So you hit
it due to this weird filtering issue, but presumably random interference
can also just lead to losses if they exhaust the hardware retry chain.
But maybe this is not something that's noticeable because the hardware
retry chain is usually enough? Do you notice any errors/retries in your
AP stats after applying the fix (in normal usage, not just with a ping
test)?

Anyway, I don't think it's unreasonable to add the same retry logic to
non-aggregated frames that we have for aggregated ones, and the retry_q
seems like the simplest way to do that.
