Ah got it. I agree with you on their pattern of breaking compatibility
but things are improving, I won't say we are there yet.

Ah that is possible, yes I can't disagree.

But I must say it is improving as the firmware teams implementing newer
versions run the existing kernel and spot the issues quickly if anything
is incompatible if the spec hadn't broken it intentionally.

Completely understood.

Really, that's news to me.

Yes agreed. The only argument I had is for the existing users whom we are
fitting into the SMCCC bus like TRNG. But we need some agreement on the
spec consistency if we need to do anything more smart in the core SMCCC
bus code.

But then we will have to wait for that discovery SMCCC ABI first and that
mean how will it work on existing deployed systems ? But I like the idea.

I don't know if I got the details right but I get the overall idea here.

Indeed, I prefer this and get mad if new features are added without
feature bits. Version for me is just for rough indication that ideally
these features must be 0 on a version X but it shouldn't matter for
the software that purely relies on feature bits. So a big yes for that
idea and I think some specs and in some form are doing it. I can't
recall specific but I have seen it. We just need push only for that
in future specs.

Completely agreed!
