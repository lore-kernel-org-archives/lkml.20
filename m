I think this series solves this problem in a fairly clean way without
relying on version numbers.

Each ABI is now extensible with a set of structured featured flags that
are exposed to userspace. Userspace can inspect the flags that the
kernel supports and confirm the next kernel also supports them.

I think there is still room for improvement, like determining what
features are used at runtime rather than statically at compile time, or
allowing userspace to disable use of certain features to control
compatability, but I think these things can be built into this type of
model.

The value I see of the flag-based approach over the version-based
approach is:

 - Each component can have one ABI struct that extends over time and one
   serialization/deserialization routines, rather than N for the N
   supported current versions. Supporting multiple versions within a
   single kernel would be required for upgrade/downgrade. Maybe there is
   a way to make the multi-versioning support maintainable but it seems
   like it will be messy to me.

 - Features can be managed individually. Let's say a downstream user
   wants to use a new upstream feature. If we had a versioning model
   they would have to backport the entire version delta from their
   current kernel to that feature upstream. With flags they can backport
   and use an individual feature.

I agree testing matrix becomes more complex but maybe that can be
mitigated with your suggestion that upstream only "officially" supports
(i.e. tests) some constrained version sets like within a stable branch?
