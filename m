The uAPI of powervr_sgx, the render-only driver for PowerVR SGX5xx
(Series5) GPUs that the next patch adds. It follows the rules of the
Rogue driver's uAPI: type-aligned members, explicit padding, zeroed
reserved fields, one layout on i386 and x86_64. The DRM version
starts at 1.0 and the ioctl numbers are dense from 0.

- DEV_QUERY: the GPU's identity, limits, quirks and heaps.
- CREATE_BO, GET_BO_MMAP_OFFSET: shmem objects below 4 GiB. A code
  object has no CPU mapping; UPLOAD_CODE fills it, and the kernel checks
  every instruction first.
- CREATE_VM_CONTEXT, VM_BIND: one GPU page directory per VM, with
  fixed heaps; VM_BIND maps and unmaps synchronously and takes no
  fences.
- CREATE_CONTEXT, GET_CONTEXT_STATE, CREATE_RT_DATASET: render
  contexts, render target data, and the guilty/innocent state after a
  reset.
- SUBMIT_JOBS: render jobs with syncobj waits and signals. The
  header also has a transfer context and job (a 3D-only blit) and a
  NULL job, which the driver's test tools use. Mesa uses neither, and
  a client's first transfer can fault after another client's transfers
  have run. Both go before a v1 unless a reviewer wants them.
  A job's commands are plain structs, with an extension chain for the
  fields only one core has; the kernel copies them, checks every field
  and builds the firmware's command from them. Userspace
  never writes a firmware structure. Sync is explicit, and a job lists
  the byte ranges of imported buffers it reads or writes, for the
  kernel's cache maintenance.

Every ioctl is render-node only. Documentation/gpu/powervr_sgx has the
overview and the uAPI; MAINTAINERS gets an entry.

+===============================================
+drm/powervr_sgx PowerVR SGX545 GPU Driver
+===============================================
+
+``powervr_sgx`` is a render-only DRM driver for the PowerVR SGX545. It binds
+the GPU where it is a PCI function of its own, as in the Intel CE5300
+(``8086:089b``, core revision 1.0.14), and on Cedarview (GMA3600/3650, core
+revision 1.0.13), where the SGX shares a PCI function with the display engine,
+as the auxiliary device ``gma500_gfx.sgx`` that gma500 publishes. Scanout goes
+through a separate KMS driver, and buffers move between the two as dma-bufs.

+
+Firmware
+========
+
+The SGX545 runs a microkernel on its USSE, loaded with request_firmware() from
+``powervr_sgx/``. The microkernel takes commands from a kernel-owned command
+buffer, kicks the tile accelerator (TA) and the 3D core, and raises an
+interrupt when a job is done. The driver builds the microkernel's data
+structures: the host control block, the command buffer, render and transfer
+contexts, render target datasets and parameter buffers. Userspace never writes
+them.
+
+The supported cores are in a table (``pvrsgx_core.c``). Each core design has
+an entry with its ID, the registers whose offsets or fields differ between
+SGX5xx cores, its features, instruction set, directory lists, address width
+and init script. Each part of it has an entry with its revision, clock and
+firmware file. The bus tells the driver which core to expect, since even the
+core ID register moves between cores: the PCI ID for the CE5300, the gma500
+auxiliary device for Cedarview. The driver refuses a core that isn't in the
+table before writing any register.
+For the CE5300 the file is ``powervr_sgx/sgx545_ukernel.bin``. It starts
+with a header giving the host interface version, feature bits, the image's CRC,
+its entry points and the immediates the driver fills with buffer addresses.
+The driver only loads an image that declares secure mode, in which no client
+page directory maps the firmware's memory. After the start it asks the
+microkernel for its version and features.
+
+Memory
+======
+
+Buffer objects are shmem GEM objects with pages below 4 GiB, since the GPU's
+physical addresses are 32 bits wide. CPU mappings are write-combined. Every
+open file creates VM contexts. Each one has its own two-level page directory
+and is managed with drm_gpuvm. The client heaps sit at fixed device addresses,
+reported by ``DEV_QUERY``. Kernel-owned objects live in ranges a client can't
+map.
+
+USSE programs run only from code objects. A code object has no CPU mapping and
+can't be exported, and the GPU sees it read-only. Its contents arrive through
+``UPLOAD_CODE``, which validates them (see `Shader validation`_).
+
+dma-bufs are exported and imported with the shmem helpers. An imported object
+maps in any heap a data object maps in. A CPU mapping of an exported dma-buf
+needs ``DRM_POWERVR_SGX_BO_ALLOW_CPU_ACCESS``, as a mapping through the DRM
+file does.
+
+Shader validation
+=================
+
+The GPU's page tables keep a client's memory accesses to its own VM, but a USSE
+program can also read the core's own registers (``ldr``), which the page
+tables can't stop. On the SGX545, a client's fragment task read the core ID,
+a live timer and the page directory base. A client's ``str`` to the page
+directory base or to code bases 14 and 15 was dropped. Stores to other
+registers from a client task are untested, and the microkernel itself writes
+registers with ``str``, so stores are refused as well. So the kernel decides
+which USSE code may run for a client.
+
+**Where client code runs from.** A USSE task starts at one of the 16 USE code
+bases plus an offset, both taken from a ``DOUTU`` word of a PDS program. PDS
+programs and their data are client memory and are not checked, so a client can
+name any base and any offset. The offset, like the absolute targets inside
+USSE code, reaches at most 2 MiB past the base. The kernel programs bases 0-9
+onto the pixel shader heap, 10-13 onto the vertex shader heap, 14 the same as
+0, and 15 onto the microkernel's code, which no client page directory maps.
+From bases 0-14, everything within reach is a USSE heap or an address range no
+client can map. The USSE heaps take only code objects. So a client task runs
+code ``UPLOAD_CODE`` checked, or faults.
+
+**What UPLOAD_CODE checks.** Every 8-byte word of an upload, whether or not
+the program's branches reach it, against a table generated from the isaspec
+description of the instruction set that Mesa's compiler uses
+(``pvrsgx_usse_table.h``):
+
+- The word must be exactly one known form. Fields the compilers leave at one
+  value are pinned to it.
+- Refused outright: register-file access (``ldr``, ``str``); everything that
+  sets or uses the link address (``setl``, ``savl``, ``lapc``, a branch with
+  ``link``), since together they make a computed jump; the absolute branch
+  ``ba``; ``phas`` with a register operand; the mutexes ``lock`` and
+  ``release``, which can stall other tasks; the operand-stepping controls
+  whose effect on operand numbers is not known (``smbo``, ``smr``, ``smoa``,
+  ``imo`` and the register forms of all four with ``smlsi``); dual issue
+  (``fdual``), whose second operation's operands aren't checked; and forms
+  this core doesn't have or whose meaning is not known.
+- ``br``: the target must be inside the object.
+- ``phas.i``: a target other than 0 counts from the code base the task's PDS
+  program names. Measured: base 0 with offset 0x88380 runs code in window 1,
+  and its targets still count from base 0. The check takes the base a compiler
+  names, the 512 KiB window of the USSE heap the task's first instruction is
+  in, and the target must be inside the object where it is mapped. Such an
+  object must lie in one window, so that base is the same for every entry in
+  it, be mapped when its code is uploaded, at one place in its window only,
+  and can't be mapped at another place afterwards. A PDS program that names
+  another base only moves the target within the reach described above.
+- ``setfc``: only ``setfc #0, #1``, the format control a program starts
+  with, so the check knows the format control of every instruction without
+  following the program.
+- Each operand: no writes to constants or globals; no reads of the globals
+  past ``g45``, which are not documented; internal registers ``i0``-``i3``
+  and index registers ``idx1``-``idx2`` only. Bit 6 of an operand number is
+  a format flag only under format select (the instruction's ``fmt`` bit) or,
+  for the color classes' ``r``, ``o``, ``pa``, ``sa`` and ``i`` operands, C10
+  format control; everywhere else it is part of the number.
+
+**What is not checked, and why.** Memory accesses (``ld``, ``st``, texture
+samples, the pixel back end's tile writes through ``emit``, PDS DMA) go
+through the job's page directory, which maps only the client's own objects
+and the parameter buffer, and none of the firmware's. The GPU can't modify a
+code object once it is checked. Code objects are mapped read-only, and the MMU
+faults USSE stores and pixel back end writes to such pages.
+
+**Known gaps.**
+
+- The parameter buffer is one per device and mapped read-write into every
+  client VM, so one client's shader can read or corrupt the scenes other
+  clients are binning.
+- The following are expected but not yet tested on hardware: that a client
+  task's instruction fetch from base 15 faults, and that the read-only PTE
+  bit also stops the depth/stencil store and the tile accelerator.
+- Indexed operands and repeated instructions can step an operand past the
+  128 registers its field names. Whether the hardware keeps such accesses
+  inside the task's own registers is not documented. The compilers need
+  both.
+
+Jobs
+====
+
+One drm_gpu_scheduler feeds the microkernel, and contexts are scheduler
+entities. Unlike firmware-scheduled GPUs, where each queue gets a scheduler of
+its own, the SGX545's microkernel takes commands from a single kernel command
+buffer and doesn't choose between contexts, so drm_sched does: one job on the
+GPU at a time (credit limit 1), in priority order. After a reset the queued
+jobs simply run; nothing is resubmitted. A render job is a scene of one or two TA kicks and the 3D render that
+follows them. A transfer job is a blit. Userspace describes either with one
+struct per command and a chain of core-specific extensions, which the kernel
+copies and checks field by field, from tables generated per core, before it
+writes the microkernel's command. Jobs wait for and signal binary and timeline syncobjs;
+sync is explicit only, and a shared buffer's reservation gets no fence from the
+driver (userspace moves fences through the dma-buf's sync-file ioctls). The GPU
+doesn't snoop the CPU caches, so a job lists the bytes of imports it reads or
+writes, and the driver flushes those around it.
+
+Recovery
+========
+
+A job that doesn't finish within the scheduler's timeout, or that takes a GPU
+page fault, resets the GPU. The SGX545 raises no interrupt for a page fault, so
+the driver checks the MMU's fault status while jobs are on the GPU. The
+driver halts the cores and takes a devcoredump (registers, the microkernel's
+control blocks, the command buffer and the hung job's structures). Then it
+fails the jobs that were on the GPU: the guilty one with -ETIME, or -EFAULT
+after a fault, and the others with -ECANCELED. It restarts the microkernel and
+marks the guilty context. Its later submissions fail, and other contexts carry
+on.
+
+Power
+=====
+
+With runtime PM, a job on the GPU holds a reference. The device autosuspends
+500 ms after the last one. Suspend powers the microkernel off and holds the
+cores in reset; resume restarts it. The SGX function has no PCI PM capability,
+so it stays in D0. While the core is stopped the driver reads none of its
+registers.
+
+Debugging
+=========
+
+debugfs, under ``/sys/kernel/debug/dri/<minor>/``, has:
+
+``status``
+    firmware state, command buffer offsets, the host control block, the
+    kernel objects waiting to be freed, the client unmaps waiting for the
+    TLB invalidate and, while the GPU is awake, the core's registers.
+
+``ctlblk``
+    the microkernel's TA/3D and host control blocks.
+
+Module parameters
+=================
+
+``job_timeout_ms``
+    how long a job may run before the GPU is reset (default 2000).

+ * DOC: PowerVR SGX UAPI
+ *
+ * The DRM driver is ``powervr_sgx``. Identifiers use the same name in full,
+ * ``drm_powervr_sgx_`` and ``DRM_IOCTL_POWERVR_SGX_``, because ``pvr`` is the
+ * upstream Rogue driver's prefix.
+ *
+ * The argument structs follow the rules of the upstream PowerVR uAPI:
+ *
+ *  - All members are type-aligned, on i386 as on x86_64.
+ *  - Every struct is padded to 64-bit alignment.
+ *  - Padding is explicit, in ``_padding_x`` members, where x is the member's
+ *    offset in hexadecimal. Padding and reserved fields must be zero; the
+ *    kernel always checks them and returns -EINVAL otherwise.
+ *  - User pointers and device-virtual addresses are __u64. A device-virtual
+ *    address at or above 2^&drm_powervr_sgx_dev_query_limits.va_bits is
+ *    rejected.
+ *  - Structs reached through &struct drm_powervr_sgx_obj_array can grow at the
+ *    end. A short object is zero-extended. In an object longer than the kernel
+ *    knows, the unknown bytes must be zero.
+ *  - Client commands grow the same way, through &drm_powervr_sgx_cmd_head.size,
+ *    and carry core-specific fields in extensions: see "PowerVR SGX client
+ *    commands" below.
+ *
+ * The DRM driver's version is 1.0. Additions to the interface raise the minor
+ * version; nothing is removed or renumbered.
+ */

+ * only:
+ *
+ *  - when the job is about to run, it writes back and drops the CPU's lines of
+ *    every range, so the GPU reads what the CPU wrote and no dirty line lands on
+ *    the job's output later;
+ *  - once the job's writes have reached memory, and before its out-fence
+ *    signals, it drops the lines of every range with
+ *    %DRM_POWERVR_SGX_CACHE_RANGE_FLAG_WRITE, which the CPU may have fetched
+ *    again meanwhile. A job whose out-fence carries an error gets no such
+ *    flush: its WRITE ranges are undefined.
+ *
+ * The range is @rows rows of @size bytes, @stride bytes apart, from @offset,
+ * widened to whole cache lines: one damage rectangle of a linear buffer is one
+ * entry. @rows 0 is one row. An entry for an object that isn't an import (ours

+ * writes the whole import back once when it is imported, so a stale line or a
+ * stale DRAM word is the object's own earlier contents. Bytes a job rewrites
+ * unchanged (a render's tiles outside its draws, which it loaded) need no entry
+ * while the CPU doesn't write the object during the job.
