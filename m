EL2 owns a protected vCPU's state once it has run, and the ioctls that
would reach it fail rather than operate on the host copy, which holds
the boot state the VMM wrote plus what the exit handlers copy out.
Describe the resulting API in pkvm.rst, point api.rst at it from each
ioctl that behaves differently, and say beside the PVTIME attribute
in devices/vcpu.rst and the PSCI version register in
fw-pseudo-registers.rst how protected VMs differ. The overview also
states the GIC support pKVM enforces: GICv2 is not supported in
protected mode (vgic-v2.c) and GICv5-based guests aren't registered
under pKVM (vgic-v5.c).

 Protected VM firmware (pvmfw)
 -----------------------------
 
 Status: **Unimplemented.**
 
+API behaviour for protected VMs
+===============================
+
+Protected vCPU state is owned by EL2 (see `CPU state isolation`_). The VMM
+configures a vCPU before its first ``KVM_RUN``; afterwards the state is
+private to the guest and the ioctls that access it return ``-EPERM``. The
+vCPU ioctls' errors follow one rule: ``-EPERM`` means the host asked for
+state that the guest owns, ``-EINVAL`` means the request is not valid for a
+protected VM, and a feature pKVM doesn't support for protected VMs is
+rejected the way KVM rejects one that isn't implemented (``-ENXIO`` from
+``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL``, for example). The ioctls themselves are
+described in Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst.
+
+Boot
+----
+
+A protected VM boots from a single primary vCPU. Before the first
+``KVM_RUN``, the VMM prepares the boot state:
+
+* Set ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` on the primary vCPU and
+  ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` on every other vCPU. EL2 allows only one
+  RUNNABLE primary per protected VM. A second RUNNABLE vCPU fails at its
+  first ``KVM_RUN``.
+* Set the primary vCPU's boot state with ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG``: the kernel
+  entry address in ``PC`` and the DTB pointer in ``x0``.
+
+``PC`` and ``x0`` are the only registers EL2 takes from the host. Other
+pre-run writes are accepted, but the guest starts from the state the
+hypervisor resets it to.
+
+Secondary vCPUs are started by the guest itself through PSCI ``CPU_ON``
+(see `Power state`_), which supplies their entry point and context ID.
+The VMM cannot choose where they boot.
+
+vCPU state
+----------
+
+* ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` and ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` return ``-EPERM`` once the
+  vCPU has run. Before that, they access the host-side copy from which
+  EL2 builds the guest's boot state (see `Boot`_).
+* ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` accepts only the vCPU features that a protected
+  guest supports and returns ``-EINVAL`` otherwise.
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PSCI_0_2`` is required, as EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for
+  the guest (see `Power state`_). ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT`` is not
+  supported: protected guests run in AArch64 only and see no AArch32
+  support in ``ID_AA64PFR0_EL1``. Once the vCPU has run,
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` returns ``-EPERM``, as re-initialising it would
+  reset the host-side copy alone.
+* ``KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS`` returns ``-EPERM`` for external-abort injection
+  (``ext_dabt_pending``), and ``KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_DABT`` is not
+  advertised to a protected VM. SError injection is unaffected.
+* ``KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG`` returns ``-EPERM``, and ``KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG``
+  is not advertised to a protected VM (see `Debug`_).
+
+Power state
+-----------
+
+EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for a protected guest. The calls that move a
+vCPU's power state, ``CPU_ON`` and ``CPU_OFF``, are handled at EL2, and
+the host cannot change the outcome: for ``CPU_ON`` the host only
+schedules the target, which EL2 has already reset to the entry point
+the guest chose, and for ``CPU_OFF`` it only stops scheduling it.
+``AFFINITY_INFO`` is handled by the host, which returns ``OFF`` once
+it has stopped scheduling every vCPU the query covers, as for a
+non-protected VM. A vCPU becomes a valid ``CPU_ON`` target at its first
+``KVM_RUN``, and before that EL2 returns ``INVALID_PARAMETERS``. The
+platform calls, ``CPU_SUSPEND``, ``SYSTEM_OFF``, ``SYSTEM_RESET`` and
+``SYSTEM_RESET2``, are forwarded to the host and behave as for a
+non-protected VM, with the ``SYSTEM_*`` calls exiting to the VMM as
+``KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT``; the ``SYSTEM_RESET2`` reset type and cookie
+are in the guest's registers, which ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` rejects once
+the vCPU has run. Any other function returns ``NOT_SUPPORTED``, and
+``PSCI_FEATURES`` reports the same set. Because the host handles those
+forwarded calls, ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` on ``KVM_REG_ARM_PSCI_VERSION``
+returns ``-EINVAL`` for a version below 1.1.
+
+Once a vCPU has run, its power state follows the guest's PSCI calls, not
+the VMM's. A vCPU that the guest has powered off with ``CPU_OFF``, or has
+not yet brought online with ``CPU_ON``, reads as
+``KVM_MP_STATE_UNINITIALIZED``, and only an in-guest ``CPU_ON`` can power
+it on: ``KVM_SET_MP_STATE`` returns ``-EPERM`` for ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE``
+and ``KVM_MP_STATE_SUSPENDED`` on it, accepts ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` and
+leaves it as it is, and never takes ``KVM_MP_STATE_UNINITIALIZED`` from
+the VMM. ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` still stops a vCPU EL2 has powered on,
+and ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` resumes it, so the VMM can pause it.
+
+Other interface differences
+---------------------------
+
+* ``KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION`` reports only the arm64 capabilities that pKVM
+  supports for protected guests, and ``KVM_ENABLE_CAP`` accepts only
+  those. Query them on the VM file descriptor: the system file descriptor
+  has no VM to filter against. The capabilities the generic KVM code
+  answers itself (``KVM_CAP_SYNC_MMU`` or ``KVM_CAP_DEVICE_CTRL``, for
+  example) are reported as for any VM, and don't mean the feature works
+  for a protected one. The filter does not cover every interface either:
+  device-fd configuration (for example the VGIC after
+  ``KVM_CREATE_DEVICE``) and vCPU attributes are unfiltered, so a feature
+  the filter excludes is rejected by the attribute itself.
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL`` returns ``-ENXIO``, for example, as it does
+  where steal time isn't implemented.
+* The vGIC of a protected VM remains host-managed: device creation,
+  configuration and interrupt injection all work as they do for a
+  non-protected VM.
+* ``KVM_ARM_SET_COUNTER_OFFSET`` and ``KVM_ARM_GET_REG_WRITABLE_MASKS``
+  return ``-EINVAL``: their capabilities are not advertised to a protected
+  VM, whose counter offset and ID registers are set by EL2. A protected
+  guest sees the physical timebase.
+* A protected guest's first access to each page of memory exits to the
+  host, since the hypervisor cannot tell memory from a device before the
+  page is mapped. For a store, the host sees the value of the register
+  the syndrome names, clamped to the access width, and nothing else from
+  the register file. For a load, the register the syndrome names takes
+  the value the host returns, as for any emulated access.
+* A protected guest that uses a feature it was not given, or executes an
+  ``SMC``, takes an undefined instruction exception from the hypervisor;
+  the host is not involved.
+* Apart from PSCI, the hypervisor handles a protected guest's SMCCC
+  calls itself and does not involve the host. A function it does not
+  implement returns ``NOT_SUPPORTED``, and the host's SMCCC filter does
+  not apply: the VM device attribute ioctls (``KVM_ARM_VM_SMCCC_CTRL``)
+  return ``-EINVAL`` for a protected VM.
+* The hypervisor can decode a trapped guest access only from the CPU's
+  instruction syndrome, which is provided only for a load or store of a
+  single general-purpose register. An access without one (for example a
+  load/store pair or a SIMD/FP access) cannot be decoded. For a
+  non-protected VM it can exit to the VMM as ``KVM_EXIT_ARM_NISV``. For a
+  protected VM it cannot be emulated by the VMM, so the guest takes a
+  synchronous external abort instead.
+
+Debug
+-----
+
+Hardware-assisted debugging is not available to protected guests.
+``MDSCR_EL1``, ``OSLAR_EL1``, ``OSLSR_EL1``, ``OSDLR_EL1``, and breakpoint
+and watchpoint 0 are RAZ/WI; any other debug register access takes an
+undefined instruction exception.
