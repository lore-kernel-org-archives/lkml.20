Sure. Essentially anything using a mailbox as a transport mechanism
needs to be able to sleep, at least if it cares about "txdone". Even
without a guaranteed latency, though, that doesn't mean we shouldn't
try to reduce the latency.

Right, the whole "independent" aspect is what I'm talking about. I'm
not saying that we're _trying_ to do all three transfers at once, but
just in the natural state of things there will be lots of clock calls
going on at the system all independently of each other. That means
it's likely there will be times when several clocks are enabled
simultaneously.

It's more than an illusion because all of the slow paths are
parallelized. For the remote processor, I believe that turning on a
clock is trivially easy: just set a bit. The slow parts are the
interrupt arriving on the remote processor and the interrupt arriving
on the Linux processor. Those _are_ parallelized. During a single
interrupt, we can see and process multiple mailbox messges (or
multiple mailbox ACKs). I can paste the example I gave earlier. Just
as you say, interrupts are processed and acted on serially. ...but
because we can parallelize the interrupt handling we still get the win
because interrupt latency is much worse than any of the actual work
that needs to be done.

0.000000: Client sends msg #1 and mbox controller initiates the xfer
0.000010: Client sends msg #2 and mbox controller initiates the xfer
0.000020: Client sends msg #3 and mbox controller initiates the xfer
0.000050: Remote gets IRQ, sees 3 messages, and ACKs them all.
0.000150: ACK IRQ arrives; mbox controller sends 3 txdone

...so all 3 messages are sent / ACKed in 150us.

Without letting the mailbox controller queue, we'd end up more like this:

0.000000: Client sends msg #1 and mbox controller initiates the xfer
0.000050: Remote gets IRQ, sees msg #1, ACKs it.
0.000150: ACK IRQ arrives; mbox controller sends txdone
0.000150: mbox core notes txdone and sends msg #2
0.000200: Remote gets IRQ, sees msg #2, ACKs it.
0.000300: ACK IRQ arrives; mbox controller sends txdone
0.000300: mbox core notes txdone and sends msg #3
0.000350: Remote gets IRQ, sees msg #3, ACKs it.
0.000450: ACK IRQ arrives; mbox controller sends txdone

The numbers here for interrupt latency are made up for my example and
I haven't personally measured them, but I think it's not completely
absurd to say that interrupt latency (on both the Linux and remote
sides) dominates the communication path.

FWIW, the driver will need to contain the queuing complexity
regardless. This is because the remote processor expects queuing. Even
if we don't queue at the Linux level, the driver still needs to know
if the remote side uses a "queuing protocol." This is because the
remote side expects the shared memory to be partitioned into chunks
and that we must move onto the next chunk between messages.
