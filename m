One limitation, "hole", is that it relies on assigning your devices early. If you've used all your
rmids and then want to assign a device then that will only succeed for a subset of the monitor
groups but you don't know which ones. Then you are left with trying until you see what works,
peering into the debug interface or just remounting.

Thanks,

Ben
