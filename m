Agreed.

Which is why I suggested moving to a counter based approach so we could=20
arbitrarily overlap any number of disable/enable pairs for a state in=20
arbitrary order, no matter what's the source.

Me too. The needs have simply outgrown the old API (which was never good=20
anyway due to its asymmetry caveat).
