Apparently this is a reproducible issue on MacBookPro14,3.  That makes
me a little hesitant because we're not actually dealing with the fact
that the Thunderbolt controller isn't responsive during suspend.

It seems worthwhile to me to skip pci_save_state() if the device isn't
accessible, but I don't think it's a real solution to whatever is
going on with Thunderbolt, and I don't think we should mention it here
as though it is.

Maybe we should remove the check in pci_dev_save_and_disable() and
make it check the return value of pci_save_state()?  I don't think
checking twice adds anything.

I bet we get 99% of the usefulness here by just adding the first
accessibility check above.

This second check only helps if the device becomes inaccessible during
the tiny window while we're saving its state, and I'm not sure that
the extra complexity here and being able to restore a valid config
header with junk in the capabilities is really a benefit.
