In preparation to support Nitro Sandboxes, whose parent keeps using some
of the memory it hands over, add NE_MEMORY_SHARED, a flag for
NE_ALLOC_MEMORY that makes an allocation mappable. The parent needs that
to read state the device writes for it, and for virtqueues and buffers
that both the parent and the sandbox access.
