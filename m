EL2 owns a protected vCPU's state once it has run, and the ioctls that
would access it fail rather than silently operate on a copy that isn't
the guest's. Describe the resulting API in pkvm.rst, point api.rst at
it from each ioctl that behaves differently, and say beside the PVTIME
attribute in devices/vcpu.rst and the PSCI version register in
fw-pseudo-registers.rst how protected VMs differ. The overview also
states the GIC support pKVM enforces: GICv2 is not supported in
protected mode (vgic-v2.c) and GICv5-based guests aren't registered
under pKVM (vgic-v5.c).

 Protected VM firmware (pvmfw)
 -----------------------------
 
 Status: **Unimplemented.**
 
+API behaviour for protected VMs
+===============================
+
+Protected vCPU state is owned by EL2 (see `CPU state isolation`_). The VMM
+configures a vCPU before its first ``KVM_RUN``; afterwards the state is
+private to the guest and the ioctls that access it return ``-EPERM``. The
+vCPU ioctls' errors follow one rule: ``-EPERM`` means the host asked for
+state that the guest owns, ``-EINVAL`` means the request is not valid for a
+protected VM, and a feature pKVM doesn't support for protected VMs is
+rejected the way KVM rejects one that isn't implemented (``-ENXIO`` from
+``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL``, for example). The ioctls themselves are
+described in Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst.
+
+Boot
+----
+
+A protected VM boots from a single primary vCPU. Before the first
+``KVM_RUN``, the VMM prepares the boot state:
+
+* Set ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` on the primary vCPU and
+  ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` on every other vCPU. EL2 allows only one
+  RUNNABLE primary per protected VM. A second RUNNABLE vCPU fails at its
+  first ``KVM_RUN``.
+* Set the primary vCPU's boot state with ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG``: the kernel
+  entry address in ``PC`` and the DTB pointer in ``x0``.
+
+``PC`` and ``x0`` are the only registers EL2 takes from the host. Other
+pre-run writes are accepted, but the guest starts from the state the
+hypervisor resets it to.
+
+Secondary vCPUs are started by the guest itself through PSCI ``CPU_ON``
+(see `Power state`_), which supplies their entry point and context ID.
+The VMM cannot choose where they boot.
+
+vCPU state
+----------
+
+* ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` and ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` return ``-EPERM`` once the
+  vCPU has run. Before that, they access the host-side copy from which
+  EL2 builds the guest's boot state (see `Boot`_).
+* ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` accepts only the vCPU features that a protected
+  guest supports and returns ``-EINVAL`` otherwise.
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PSCI_0_2`` is required, as EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for
+  the guest (see `Power state`_). ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT`` is not
+  supported: protected guests run in AArch64 only and see no AArch32
+  support in ``ID_AA64PFR0_EL1``. Once the vCPU has run,
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` returns ``-EPERM``, as re-initialising it would
+  reset the host-side copy alone.
+* ``KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS`` returns ``-EPERM`` for external-abort injection
+  (``ext_dabt_pending``), and ``KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_DABT`` is not
+  advertised to a protected VM. SError injection is unaffected.
+* ``KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG`` returns ``-EPERM``, and ``KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG``
+  is not advertised to a protected VM (see `Debug`_).
+
+Power state
+-----------
+
+EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for a protected guest. The calls that move a
+vCPU's power state, ``CPU_ON`` and ``CPU_OFF``, are handled at EL2, and
+the host cannot change the outcome: for ``CPU_ON`` the host only
+schedules the target, which EL2 has already reset to the entry point
+the guest chose, and for ``CPU_OFF`` it only stops scheduling it.
+``AFFINITY_INFO`` is handled by the host, which returns ``OFF`` once
+it has stopped scheduling every vCPU the query covers, as for a
+non-protected VM. A vCPU becomes a valid ``CPU_ON`` target at its first
+``KVM_RUN``, and before that EL2 returns ``INVALID_PARAMETERS``. The
+platform calls, ``CPU_SUSPEND``, ``SYSTEM_OFF``, ``SYSTEM_RESET`` and
+``SYSTEM_RESET2``, are forwarded to the host and behave as for a
+non-protected VM, with the ``SYSTEM_*`` calls exiting to the VMM as
+``KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT``; the ``SYSTEM_RESET2`` reset type and cookie
+are in the guest's registers, which ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` rejects once
+the vCPU has run. Any other function returns ``NOT_SUPPORTED``, and
+``PSCI_FEATURES`` reports the same set. Because the host handles those
+forwarded calls, ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` on ``KVM_REG_ARM_PSCI_VERSION``
+returns ``-EINVAL`` for a version below 1.1.
+
+Once a vCPU has run, its power state follows the guest's PSCI calls, not
+the VMM's. ``KVM_SET_MP_STATE`` with ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` still stops
+the vCPU, so the VMM can pause it. ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` and
+``KVM_MP_STATE_SUSPENDED`` return ``-EPERM`` for a vCPU that the guest has
+powered off with ``CPU_OFF``, or has not yet brought online with ``CPU_ON``:
+only an in-guest ``CPU_ON`` can power it on.
+
+Other interface differences
+---------------------------
+
+* ``KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION`` reports only the arm64 capabilities that pKVM
+  supports for protected guests, and ``KVM_ENABLE_CAP`` accepts only
+  those. Query them on the VM file descriptor: the system file descriptor
+  has no VM to filter against. The capabilities the generic KVM code
+  answers itself (``KVM_CAP_SYNC_MMU`` or ``KVM_CAP_DEVICE_CTRL``, for
+  example) are reported as for any VM, and don't mean the feature works
+  for a protected one. The filter does not cover every interface either:
+  device-fd configuration (for example the VGIC after
+  ``KVM_CREATE_DEVICE``) and vCPU attributes are unfiltered, so a feature
+  the filter excludes is rejected by the attribute itself.
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL`` returns ``-ENXIO``, for example, as it does
+  where steal time isn't implemented.
+* The vGIC of a protected VM remains host-managed: device creation,
+  configuration and interrupt injection all work as they do for a
+  non-protected VM.
+* ``KVM_ARM_SET_COUNTER_OFFSET`` and ``KVM_ARM_GET_REG_WRITABLE_MASKS``
+  return ``-EINVAL``: their capabilities are not advertised to a protected
+  VM, whose counter offset and ID registers are set by EL2. A protected
+  guest sees the physical timebase.
+* A protected guest's first access to each page of memory exits to the
+  host, since the hypervisor cannot tell memory from a device before the
+  page is mapped. For a store, the host sees the value of the register
+  the syndrome names, clamped to the access width, and nothing else from
+  the register file. For a load, the register the syndrome names takes
+  the value the host returns, as for any emulated access.
+* A protected guest that uses a feature it was not given, or executes an
+  ``SMC``, takes an undefined instruction exception from the hypervisor;
+  the host is not involved.
+* Apart from PSCI, the hypervisor handles a protected guest's SMCCC
+  calls itself and does not involve the host. A function it does not
+  implement returns ``NOT_SUPPORTED``, and the host's SMCCC filter does
+  not apply: the VM device attribute ioctls (``KVM_ARM_VM_SMCCC_CTRL``)
+  return ``-EINVAL`` for a protected VM.
+* The hypervisor can decode a trapped guest access only from the CPU's
+  instruction syndrome, which is provided only for a load or store of a
+  single general-purpose register. An access without one (for example a
+  load/store pair or a SIMD/FP access) cannot be decoded. For a
+  non-protected VM it can exit to the VMM as ``KVM_EXIT_ARM_NISV``. For a
+  protected VM it cannot be emulated by the VMM, so the guest takes a
+  synchronous external abort instead.
+
+Debug
+-----
+
+Hardware-assisted debugging is not available to protected guests.
+``MDSCR_EL1``, ``OSLAR_EL1``, ``OSLSR_EL1``, ``OSDLR_EL1``, and breakpoint
+and watchpoint 0 are RAZ/WI; any other debug register access takes an
+undefined instruction exception.
