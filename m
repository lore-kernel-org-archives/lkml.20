Hi Steven and Marc,

Sorry for the late response.

The results confirm your concern. Our initial hackbench measurements showed
considerable performance overhead for the non-TDIR Realm configuration with
pseudo-NMI enabled. Due to restrictions on disclosing performance data for our
hardware, I cannot share the absolute results or further platform details.

However, with pseudo-NMI disabled, performance was comparable to the
TDIR-capable configuration. The difference was at most a few percent across
runs.

There is a real need to run Realm VMs in environments that do not require
pseudo-NMI, and non-TDIR hardware can meet that need. Pseudo-NMI is not enabled
by default in many commonly used distributions, and native NMI support through
FEAT_NMI may also reduce the need for pseudo-NMI in the near future. As a
result, the number of use cases in which the observed performance limitation is
relevant is likely to decrease. Therefore, the pseudo-NMI result does not
necessarily make non-TDIR Realm support impractical for all current or future
use cases.

Note that the initial measurements used pre-production versions of TF-RMM and
TF-A. During our evaluation, we applied preliminary tuning to these firmware
components and have already observed substantial performance improvements.

For the production release of our hardware, we plan to further tune the
software stack, including these firmware components, together with the hardware
configuration. We therefore believe that there remains meaningful room for
further performance improvement, although we cannot yet quantify the final
improvement.

I agree that non-TDIR has a performance limitation for trap-intensive
configurations. However, given the actual customer demand for running CCA
workloads that do not require pseudo-NMI, I believe that supporting Realm VMs
on non-TDIR hardware still has clear practical value. It would also allow us to
accelerate validation of the upstream CCA KVM implementation on real silicon
using upstream code paths and contribute additional real-hardware test coverage
as the implementation evolves.

Thanks,
Kohei
