'charge' in this sentence is somewhat like 'charge a fee'.  I personally don't
feel it is weird.  But 'record' also work for me.

So this looks good to me, too.

If use of the term 'charge' is really making reading difficult, we could add a
short definition of 'charge' as a separate patch.

E.g.,

 To mitigate that situation, DAMOS provides an upper-bound overhead control
 feature called quotas.  It lets users specify an upper limit of time that DAMOS

before posting v2.
