Well, I'm not sure if my understanding is correct.

Suppose that the cpufreq driver has a frequency table which is
processed by cpufreq_table_validate_and_sort(), right after the
driver's ->init() has returned.

That function calls cpufreq_frequency_table_cpuinfo() for the first
time and policy->cpuinfo.max_freq is set.  However, if boost is not
enabled (that is, cpufreq_boost_enabled() returns false or
policy->boost_enabled is false), it only takes frequency table entries
without CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ into account, so policy->cpuinfo.max_freq
is one of those frequencies.

I would think that the CPU capacity has already been set at this point
and now the question arises whether or not it corresponds to
policy->cpuinfo.max_freq because that is what is assumed by
init_cpu_capacity_callback() invoked subsequently (via the
cpufreq_policy_notifier_list chain).

The $subject patch seems to suggest that the answer is "no" and the
capacity really corresponds to the highest frequency in the table
which may be flagged with CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ.  Is that always the case
though and if not, then how can we tell?

> Can the boost OPP be added later?

Not really.  It is already there in the frequency table, but the
question is if that's the capacity OPP.  I guess we need to assume so?

No, I think it's the only way.

So init_cpu_capacity_callback() should find the highest frequency in
the table (regardless of whether or not the "boost" flag is set) and
set capacity_freq_ref to that one for each CPU UUIC.

That's roughly what the patch does, but it can get away without adding
a new field to struct cpufreq_policy.

And the changelog needs to be rewritten to tell the true story.
