I don't know. "Not available for DMA" defeats the whole purpose of dma-buf,
which is intended to expose DMA-capable memory to other peers. I imagine
that "everything is optional dmabuf world" this is possible, but it
looks to me like a partial version of revoked flow.

How? It will move one piece of code as is to another place. In addition,
both exporter and importer need to stop HW access to same region.
