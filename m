Thanks for the debugging.  Before that remove, can you collect the
output of "sudo lspci -vv" so we have a picture of the whole topology?

It seems legit to remove one function of the multi-function device at
75:00.x (from a software perspective; obviously we can't physically
remove it separately from the other functions), but seems like we
prematurely discard the ASPM link info when doing so.  I haven't dug
into them, but maybe these commits have some bearing on this:

  456d8aa37d0f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to avoid use-after-free")
  cbf937dcadfd ("PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal")
