Nothing generates NMIs. But from the linux kernel's point of view any
activity of the companion core is NMI-like, since disabling interrupts
from the linux kernel does not stop it from running.

Our co-kernel keeps control of the real interrupt mask, so Linux cannot
delay it. Most of the time what Linux disables and enables is a virtual
mask instead of the real one.

Tracing already works inside EVL, thanks to a downstream patch [1]. It
is mainly fixing all the points that rely on interrupt masking by
calling the correct wrappers.

I would expect that we have to do similar for BPF. Some of the checks
already exist to cope with NMIs and we would just have to make it
recognize our stage too.

You are clearly much more into the topic than I am. I will have to take
a closer look to better understand the BPF data structures and,
especially, their locking mechanisms before I can answer this.

My use case is, so far, not that strict. It is more that the bigger the
tool gets, the harder it becomes to argue that it does not change the
behavior of the system under test. If the tool remains simple in the end
and I can describe its behavior as deterministic, there will be no issue.

Thanks for taking a look!

It sounds to me that you think about moving the complete RV system to
BPF. Is this correct? In the end I will try to follow if you decide to
go down the BPF route. Possibly after some delay but nevertheless.

Should I wait with proposing a v3 of this patch set until you made a
final decision or do you want to merge this in the current RV system no
matter how this develops?

Best,
Tobias
