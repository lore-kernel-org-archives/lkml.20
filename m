Hi David,

Thanks for the great feedback and suggestion.

Passing the array element size so that callers can embed struct
ctl_table at offset 0 and use plain container_of() is indeed a
very clean idea, and definitely worth exploring as a follow-up.

For the current bounds refactoring and priv removal, we will send
out v2 shortly for review.

Thanks,
Wen
