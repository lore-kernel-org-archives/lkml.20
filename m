Unfortunately, this is not an option anymore due to the opinion of the 
CMVP that was issued back in March. If you have an account (you can sign 
up for free), you can read it in full here: 
https://cmuf-workspace.org/Products/Projects/Messages.aspx?prjID=3&id=559. 
I can also send a copy of the PDF file privately, if necessary.

The relevant text is:

     1.a. Can xxhash64 be used in approved mode as non-security function 
without any further action (in this case FIPS IG 2.4.A will not be 
applicable)?

     Answer: No, xxhash64 cannot be understood as a non-security 
function because:
     1) It is offered as an equivalent hash alternative to approved hash 
algorithms (i.e., SHA) using the same interface/API and therefore 
appears to an operator that it can provide cryptographic protection 
(i.e., security).
     2) Its return value (i.e., mode indicator) is the same as for 
approved cryptographic functions that provide security.
     3) It is accessed by an interface/API that has “crypto” in the name 
and thus implies security.
     4) It is an available hash function (i.e. PRF) of HMAC, which is a 
keyed algorithm that implies security.

crc32 and crc32c were not explicitly called out in the resolution, which 
is why this patch didn't target them. Though following the same 
rationale, they should also be disabled.
