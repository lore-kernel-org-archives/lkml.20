Andy raised the point about too much description on the next patch and
it definitely applies here as well. Think about what matters to those
reading the patch. E.g. something like.

"The LTC2499 includes a temperatures sensor. Expose the raw reading and
appropriate scale and offset."

If this stuff belongs anywhere it is as comments where the maths is
in the code. You have it it there, no point in repeating here.

This bit is useful but focus on what matters a little more. Something like
"As scale and offset depend on the reference voltage, if no regulator
 is specified by firmware, reading them will return an error."
I'd talk about why as well. e.g. "As this is a new feature simply failing
probe is not a option."

Implementation detail this description shouldn't mention.

What does this mean to the user? =20

I'd not bother talking about what happens for those that are unaffected
(given it is the obvious answer of nothing!)

Say why it is 'always' done.  Seems you could do it only when the configura=
tion
needs to change.  Thus if someone keeps reading a particular channel don't =
send
the second byte?  Fine to just say it is for simplicity.
