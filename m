Hi Sudeep,

Apologies, this one took longer to address. Thanks for raising this,

Short answer yes, to be safe.

I agree this is poorly documented and we are working on improving the
documentation on this front.

RMI_BLOCKED is a side effect of an incomplete operation (in other
words long running) that has turned some "resource" into an
intermediate state. e.g.

The following operations could put objects into an intermediate
state until the RMM completes it, to ensure correctness.

  * Unmap a large IPA range triggering SMMU TLB invalidations.
    For KVM, we serialize the unmap S2 with kvm->mmu_lock with
    write lock. So two operations could not race (even a map
    at the same location).

  * Delegate/Undelegate, which again could end up in SMMU GPC
    invalidations.
    The only case where we race and do parallel "delegate" is
    while handling concurrent VCPU faults on two different physical
    CPUs. Even there a failing thread handles this by returning
    to the guest and taking the fault again (if it wasn't
    resolved by the other thread). We could additionally tighten
    this by using write lock for the fault (just like pKVM).

  * Change the tracking region granularity. e.g, convert from FINE
    granulartiy to COARSE or INTERMEDIATE, causing all granules in
    the target region to be locked. This is not something we do
    in Linux. We mandate the firmware maintains FINE granularity,
    at least for now. Even with dynamic tracking, we don't expect
    to fold the tracking granularity for regions with "mixed"
    entries (which would fail anyway due to the mismatch).

  * An object bound SRO handle is active, while another SRO initiating
    operation is issued. This possible with a buggy host.
    e.g., RMI_REALM_ACTIVATE is called while RMI_RTT_INIT_RIPAS is
    in progress. In KVM we serialize this with kvm->arch.config_lock.

For all practical purposes the above operations should complete in
a single try and another command observing the RMI_BLOCKED should
be able to make progress. That said, for Linux it is better to
return the RMI_BLOCKED back to the caller after an arbitrary
tiny number of times. So I have updated the code to try for
3 times for RMI_BLOCKED and return back to the caller.

We could even drop that and just return back immediately to
the caller. Like I described above, the only case where
we expect to hit the RMI_BLOCKED in Linux is for parallel
faults, which could be handled and/or prevented in Linux.

Ack. I have made the changes in the next version.
