It would be unusual to document what happens in a hardware bug situation
in an ABI doc.  Tends to be noisy and hopefully never applies.
I don't mind it being added if people really think it adds value.

This is only the read path I think? I guess documenting that
writes can only be of allowed values and otherwise you get an
error return would be fine but to me that would normally be
assumed for a sysfs parameter.  It is nicer for userspace than
alternative of just ignoring such a write.

Far as I know, today this is the only ECS control driver.
Maybe someone surfaced another whilst I wasn't paying attention though
or someone has one in the works.
