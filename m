Hi Zhang, thank you so much for looking into this.

So I agree that it is a tricky issue to solve since we don't want to
add too much complexity in the fast path. Actually the first prototype I
did for this (back in sep before we started seeing this in distros) was
becuase I was working on moving zeroout to the fast path rather than
just a fallback and had hit this fairly easily there.

In the first prototype, I took the exact approach you discussed here. A
new CONV_PENDING type for extent cache with all the plumbing to ensure
we don't lose the status untill the conversion happens. What I reliased
was that although this was a much more accurate fix, it needed lots of
core changes to es layer, and I ran into several bugs where data got
corrupted cause the status was getting lost or not in sync. I did manage
to fix most of them but it somehow makes me a bit uncomfortable from the
POV of a backport.

The patch for the inital version (v v rough and not cleaned up since
Sep) can be found here [1]. 

I'll address your below ideas on how/if i implemented them in [1]

I added a CONV_PENDING es type rather than flag. I did start with the
flag over UNWRITTEN approach but most places like merging logic care
that the type rather than flag and which was causing us to merge
UNWRITTEN and CONV_PENDING which we can't allow. So instead of modiying
code around merging and other areas I just made CONV_PENDING a separate
type.

Yes true, this is handled. We also make sure the CONV_PENDING extents
can't be evicted from es cache.

Yup, this 2, 3 and 4 are exactly implemented as you mentioned.

Yes I agree, the es approach did feel more elegant and performance
efficient, especially if we want to consider moving zeroout to the fast
path in the future. However, again I was a bit apprehensive of the
complexity it brings and the amount of core paths we are touhcing. I was
planing to do that as an improvement once we have something basic like
the counter approach in this patchset implemented.

Yep, thats true and [1] does take of 1. as well and was passing some of
the basic stress tests IIRC.


> 
> What do you think?

I agree that in the long term es cache approach is definitely the way to
move forward. I'm just wondering if it would be feasible to backport
something like that. Then again if we want to backport only till 7.0,
maybe it wont be that big of a deal. 

There are 2 approaches that I can see here:
1. USe this patch set's counter apprach as a stop gap, easy to backport
solution which works but is a bit clumsy. With the immediate fix in
place, we can take time to test and design the extent status approach
correctly and land it as a feature rather than something that needs
backport.

2. Ditch the counter approach and just fix it in one shot with extent
status approach like in [1].

I'm happy to work on either of the two, what do you think shall be the
right way forward?
