Hmm.  I'll see about adding that to this path, thanks.

It's improved every system I've tried and measured; but the level of 
improvement comes down to what hardware is contained.

The most demonstrable improvement comes from systems with dGPUs.

OK.

How would you feel about a heuristic to turn it on for anything with > 1 
GPU/accelerator for now?  I think that's the biggest bang for the buck 
right now.

But deciding when/how to turn it on for more systems than that I think 
is going to require a wider call for testing.
