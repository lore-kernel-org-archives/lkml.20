Good point. I did consider that.  My hesitation with folding it into
locks_translate_pid() is that posix_lock_to_flock() also uses it, so
F_GETLK/F_OFD_GETLK would then report a conflicting OFD lock with
l_pid = 0 instead of the -1 that fcntl(2) documents for OFD locks.
That's why I kept the check in locks_show(), where it only affects
the /proc/locks view.

That distinction isn't introduced by this patch, though, since it
already exists for POSIX locks: since the 4.9 pid namespace filter, a
foreign-namespace POSIX lock that blocks F_GETLK is reported there
with l_pid = 0 while /proc/locks hides it.  v2 just gives OFD locks
the same treatment.

That's a reasonable alternative - anonymizing the owner instead of
hiding the lock does have precedent (fdinfo follows that model), and I
can see the debugging benefit of always showing locks that may block
acquisition.  I went with hiding because it preserves the /proc/locks
visibility semantics introduced in 4.9 by making OFD locks consistent
with POSIX locks.  With only the pid anonymized, the output would
still disclose which files are locked and the locked byte ranges of
tasks outside the reader's pid namespace.

If the consensus is that /proc/locks should show all locks with an
anonymized pid instead, I'm happy to rework the patch in that
direction.

Thanks,
Tao
