Ah yes, I misunderstood.

Hmm, it depends what you mean by "theoretically". In mpam_resctrl_pick_counters() the class to back
each event is chosen. For QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID it will always be the class at the L3. For
QOS_L3_MBM_TOTAL_EVENT_ID the topology_matches_l3() call will check the cpu mask matches the L3.
Does that answer query or am I missing something else?

Thanks,

Ben
