Umm, no way I am reading all this...

LLMs are great at generating tests, and I'm not saying there is no value
in this. It is just that this massive code dump is unreviewable by
humans. It is also unfair to the human reviewer because it took many
orders of magnitude less effort to _write_ them with an LLM.

What do you all reckon we should do about this? Trust the LLM to get the
testing right? Do we give up human maintenance of tests entirely? Do we
do fault injection to test the tests themselves?

Or do we make the tests smaller and more human reviewable?
