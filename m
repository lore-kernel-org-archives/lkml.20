Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v4 0/8] selftests/bpf: let the arena tests build with GCC

The arena selftests cannot be built by GCC today. Three separate
build failures stand in the way, and they are all hidden rather than
avoided by the __BPF_FEATURE_ADDR_SPACE_CAST guards wrapped around
those tests -- the moment a GCC defines that macro, which is what the
in-progress arena support does, the guards stop hiding them and the
build breaks.

Behind the same guards the reporting is also not true. Tests inside a
whole-file guard do not appear at all, so the report is silent about
them. Tests with a guard inside the function keep an empty body that
satisfies __success __retval(0) by doing nothing, and report OK.

So: fix the build failures, then drop the guards entirely and tag the
few tests that genuinely need the feature, which removes the
empty-body failure mode rather than reporting around it.

Numbers are test_progs on bpf-next with a stock bpf-gcc, before and
after:

 1/8: Gate the callx tests on CAN_USE_CALLX, which also accepts a GCC
      defining __BPF_FEATURE_CALLX.
   -> 79 newly visible, 78 OK and one @unpriv SKIP.

 2/8: Keep clang-only warning flags out of GCC builds.

 3/8: Make arena_base() opaque to GCC's -Warray-bounds, as stream.c
      already did for its own copy, and fold that copy back in.
   -> no verdict change.

 4/8: Spell the addr_space_cast address spaces in decimal. gas only
      took hex after 2.47, and the failure is in the assembler.
   -> no functional change.

 5/8: Write the mixed arena/scalar ALU tests in asm, rather than a
      volatile register variable GCC may optimise away.
   -> both now run under a stock bpf-gcc.

 6/8: Drop the arena guards and tag the tests that need the feature.
   -> 27 newly visible, 22 running and passing; four need the tag.

 7/8: Cast explicitly in the four struct_ops arena triggers, which
      test_loader does not drive so the tag cannot reach them.
   -> 2 tests stop reporting a vacuous OK and run for real.

 8/8: Cast explicitly with bpf_addr_space_cast() in the arena subprog
      and callback faults, as the sibling tests already do.
   -> 15 FAIL -> OK, 5 newly visible.

Totals for the series:

  FAIL  472 -> 456        OK -> FAIL regressions:  0
  OK   7061 -> 7167
  SKIP  753 ->  772

v3 -> v4:

Alexei suggested simpler mechanisms for three patches. That exposed
build failures that had to be fixed first, so the series is renumbered.

 - v3 3/8: the #else dummies are gone. Rather than give each guard a
   placeholder that reports SKIP, drop the guards and tag the tests
   that need the feature (Alexei)
 - v3 4/8: arena_base() folds barrier_var() (Alexei)
 - v3 8/8: cast_kern() instead of the flag in .data. (Alexei)

 - New 4/8: addr_space_cast address spaces in decimal. gas has bug
   which is fixed but not released yet
 - 5/8: the asm rewrite of the mixed ALU tests moves ahead of the
   guard removal -- with the guards gone GCC sees the volatile
   register variables and -Werror=volatile-register-var fires. Both
   tests now run under a stock bpf-gcc.
 - verifier_hmul_arena.c converted away from dummy skip for consistency.

v2 -> v3:

 - Rebased on bpf-next.
 - 1/8: the bot asked about data_in_arena.c, whose use_ops() gated an
   indirect call on __clang__ with no arch condition. That file has
   since gone in 3c13b2e5a40e ("selftests/bpf: Remove tests for global
   data in arena"), so nothing is left to convert. The missing word in
   the commit message is fixed. (bot)
 - 7/8: the comment on the r9 load said it was what makes libbpf record
   the arena, which stopped being true with cd7a395838cb ("libbpf: Bind
   the arena of an object to every program in it"). The load is now
   only a fallback for a kernel without fd_array_cnt and for the light
   skeleton; say that instead. (bot)

v1 -> v2:

 - 1/8: the __skip() reason named only x86/arm64 while CAN_USE_CALLX
   also accepts riscv64. Say "arch JIT" instead of listing them, so
   the string cannot go stale the next time an arch is added. (bot)
 - 3/8: jit_insns_arena.c was missed. Both of its programs are inside
   the guard, so without arena support the object has none at all and
   RUN_TESTS(jit_insns_arena) ran zero subtests without saying so.
   (bot)
 - 5/8: commit message only. It cited arena_types to argue the kfunc
   tests need no cast, but the address parameters carry the __ign
   suffix, so get_kfunc_arg_type() returns ARG_IGNORE and
   check_func_arg() returns before any register type check.
   Conclusion unchanged, for a better reason. (bot)
 - 5/8: arena_kfunc.c, verifier_arena_globals1.c and
   verifier_arena_globals2.c had the same empty-body shape and were
   missed; nine more guards go and seven more tags arrive.
   arena_kfunc.c alone had eight subtests reporting a vacuous OK.
 - 8/8: new patch, for the four struct_ops arena progs.

   The three bot findings prompted a sweep of every prog with an
   arena guard, which is where the last two came from.
