I see. I would just not call that a safeguard, it's more of a
time bomb ;-)

Note that the cutoff was never meant to help systems actually
run beyond 2038, but instead is only needed on very rare systems
with a broken RTC implementation that have a random reset
value if the RTC is enabled in devicetree but the backup battery
is absent or depleted.

I think that would be great, we can certainly try again, at least
with glibc, where at the time the concern was more about the timing
of behavior changes.

There are two separate questions here:

a) Having a libc build only against the time64 interfaces. As far
   as I understand, glibc has used linux-3.2 headers as the
   baseline for kernel compatibility for a long time but one can
   choose a later version. Building with 5.10+ as the minimum
   should already avoid the time32 syscalls, but that could at
   some point be made the minimum header version for 32-bit targets
   or everything.
   musl does not specify a minimum kernel version at all and tries
   to go back as far as possible, so the fallback code is likely
   to stay indefinitely. Rich also does not like the idea of setting
   CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME=n (ever), and an unpatched musl
   build will fail in that configuration.
   
b) providing 32-bit interfaces to applications: both libraries
   already provide these as wrappers around the 64-bit internal
   functions, which is part of the problem here but does mean that
   it should be possible to just leave those out. On musl this
   should be very easy (just skip building the compat/time32/
   directory), on glibc I expect this to be much harder as it
   interferes with their idea of having __TIMESIZE=64 vs
   __TIMESIZE=32 as a hardcoded per-architecture setting.

I think the 'default COMPAT_32BIT_TIME' would absolutely make
sense for stable, since that can only really be set by users that
have a fully 64-bit userspace already and the limit will
cause problems for them.
I would still go one step further and make this

config RTC_HCTOSYS_TIME32_LIMIT
	bool "Reject RTC dates after the 2038 cutoff"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS && !64BIT && COMPAT_32BIT_TIME
	default y

to completely disallow it. I think we should wait for Alexandre
to comment here, as it's his subsystem in the end and I'm sure
he has an opinion on the matter.
