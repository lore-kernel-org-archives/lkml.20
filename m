This is less likely to cause a regression. Nice idea.

I plan to introduce mmc_send_tuning_timeout() in v2 and convert
dw_mmc-rockchip to use it with a smaller timeout. Other platforms
that also care about the overly long per-command timeout can opt
in individually later.

Thanks for the suggestion.
