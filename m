v8->v9:
- Dropped the setfcap_level patch and the checks on the uid_map opener
  and writer and on file capabilities (old 1/6, 3/6 and 4/6).  They only
  stopped a task that gave up CAP_SETFCAP from using a namespace, a map
  fd or a map that a task with CAP_SETFCAP set up for it, and that task
  could have done it all on its own (Serge).
- setns() and ptrace compare kuids instead of levels: a task without
  CAP_SETFCAP can't join a namespace whose tasks can write file
  capabilities for the root user of its own namespace, and can't attach
  to a task with CAP_SETFCAP in one unless it has CAP_SYS_PTRACE
  (Serge).  The check doesn't go by the task's uids, which it can move
  away from 0 while keeping its other capabilities.
- The selftest drops the cases of the dropped patches and adds
  PTRACE_TRACEME, a joiner that moved its euid, a target with
  CAP_SETFCAP only in its bounding set, and a namespace without a
  uid_map under one that maps host uid 0 at uid 5, 39 cases now.

v7->v8:
- 6/6 only, 1-5 are unchanged.  A case whose setup failed in a child
  waited for the harness timeout, because the parent kept its own copy
  of the pipe end it read from.  The cases where a privileged task maps
  for one that gave up CAP_SETFCAP now share one helper that talks to
  it over a socket pair, and the others close the ends they don't use,
  so a failed step ends the case with a setup error at once (Sashiko).

v6->v7:
- 6/6 only, 1-5 are unchanged.  Every case now reaches the step it is
  named for, and a setup step that fails is an error rather than a
  refusal.  Cases that stopped at setns() are setns() cases now: a task
  that joins has CAP_SETFCAP wherever the creator had it, so nothing
  after setns() checks it.  In the v3 rootid, nesting after dropping
  CAP_SETFCAP and reverse idmapped mount cases a privileged task maps a
  namespace created without CAP_SETFCAP, so the xattr gets written.
  pidfd_getfd() is a ptrace case of its own.  The session keyring case
  joins a keyring of its own first, so it works under su, and skips
  without keyrings (Sashiko).

v5->v6:
- New 6/6: a kselftest with every case the series has been through,
  48 of them.  Without the series 22 fail, with v5 the 4 below fail.
- 3/5: a task inside the namespace that is being mapped also has to
  hold CAP_SETFCAP there to open or write a uid_map that maps an
  ancestor's root user.  Before, a task that gave up CAP_SETFCAP could
  write "0 0 1" and get it back from execve() (Sashiko).
- 4/5: a v2 xattr on a filesystem whose namespace has no uid 0 is
  refused with -EINVAL instead of stored unconverted, where it was
  honoured nowhere.  Falling through to the conversion would not do:
  for a writer outside that namespace it names the writer's root user
  instead (Sashiko).

v4->v5:
- 3/5: the uid_map check only looked for an extent at the parent's uid
  0.  The root user of an ancestor can sit at any uid in the parent, so
  a task without CAP_SETFCAP could map "0 1000 1" under a "1000 0 1"
  and get host uid 0 as its uid 0 unchecked.  It now finds every
  ancestor root user the map contains.  4/5 already refused the file
  capabilities after such a map, so this is the map rule itself
  (Sashiko).  Dropped Bradley's Reviewed-by on 3/5, which changed.

v3->v4:
- 4/5: a v2 security.capability xattr skipped the new checks, it was
  written as is whenever the writer had CAP_SETFCAP over the
  filesystem's namespace.  It now only does that when the filesystem's
  root user is within reach, and goes through the v3 conversion and its
  checks otherwise (Sashiko).

v2->v3:
- The setns() check in 2/5 and the ptrace check in 5/5 only apply to
  namespaces that map the root user of an ancestor within the creator's
  CAP_SETFCAP, or that have no uid_map yet.  Root users stored through
  an idmapped mount are left to whoever sets up the mount, so a root
  task without CAP_SETFCAP can join an ordinary "0 100000" container
  again (Serge, Christian).
- 2/5 adds cred_may_setfcap_userns() for those two checks and
  cred_setfcap_reaches() for the uid_map check; nothing outside
  create_user_ns() calls cap_setfcap_level() directly (Serge).
- Fixed the cap_setfcap_level() kernel-doc, @ns doesn't have to be the
  cred's namespace or below; cap_capable() is compared with != 0
  (Serge).
- Picked up Bradley's Reviewed-by on 1/5 and 3/5, not on 2/5, which
  changed.
- Rebased onto current vfs.all.

v1->v2:
- The state lives on the user namespace now: ns->setfcap_level replaces
  ns->parent_could_setfcap, and cred->setfcap_level is gone (Serge,
  Christian).
- New 2/5: setns() refuses a task whose CAP_SETFCAP doesn't reach as far
  up as the namespace's setfcap_level.  It applies to every user
  namespace, not only to those that map the parent's uid 0, because of
  idmapped mounts (Serge, Christian).
- 5/5 asks a tracer for what setns() asks for, also when the namespace
  doesn't map an ancestor's root user, again because of idmapped mounts.
- Dropped "userns: don't let setns() lend the right to map uid 0", the
  setns() check covers it.  Its nested case moved into 3/5, which checks
  the opener and the writer.
- set_cred_user_ns() isn't touched anymore, so the put-before-use in
  userns_install() is gone (Sashiko).
- Rebased onto current vfs.all.

What it does now:

Since db2e718a4798 a root task that gave up CAP_SETFCAP can't map its
root user into a user namespace it creates.  It can still join a
namespace that another root task created, or attach to a task in one,
and get CAP_SETFCAP over its root user that way.  Patch 1 refuses
setns() when the namespace maps that root user, at any uid, or has no
uid_map yet and its tasks can still map it.  Patch 2 refuses ptrace
attach to a task with CAP_SETFCAP in such a namespace, unless the
tracer has CAP_SYS_PTRACE.  Containers that don't map host uid 0,
unprivileged users and anything with CAP_SETFCAP aren't affected.

Testing: 3/3 runs 39 cases on their own as root in private mount
namespaces.  On vfs.all without the series the 11 setns() and ptrace
cases that must be refused fail; with the series all pass.  The pidfd,
namespaces, mount_setattr and ptrace selftests give identical results
with and without.

--- Original email (v1) ---

Hello,

Commit db2e718a4798 ("capabilities: require CAP_SETFCAP to map uid 0")
stops a root task that has given up CAP_SETFCAP from creating a user
namespace that maps uid 0 and then writing file capabilities in it that
the initial namespace honours.  The check only looks at the task that
creates the namespace, so if somebody who did have CAP_SETFCAP created
one, there are still several ways around it:

- setns() into their namespace and write uid_map from inside (patch 2)
- write "0 0 1" through a uid_map fd that they opened (patch 3)
- setns() into a namespace of theirs that already maps uid 0 and set
  security.capability there, no map write needed (patch 4)
- ptrace one of their tasks and have it do any of the above (patch 5)

On an unmodified kernel we took a uid 0 task with CAP_SETFCAP dropped
from its permitted, effective and bounding sets and, through each of
these, ended up with a file that a uid 1000 user execs with
CAP_SYS_ADMIN in its effective set.

Patch 1 adds cred->setfcap_level, which records how far up the
namespace tree a task's CAP_SETFCAP reached when it entered its
namespace, and patches 2-5 check it.  Patch 4 is the check that closes
the class, the map patches make the uid 0 map rule mean what
db2e718a4798 meant it to, and patch 5 keeps ptrace from borrowing what
the target is entitled to.

This does change behaviour.  Everything new is -EPERM:

- a task that entered a namespace without CAP_SETFCAP outside can't map
  uid 0 of the outside or write fscaps for that root user anymore
- a uid_map fd opened by a task with CAP_SETFCAP can't be used by a
  task without it to map uid 0
- if a privileged task maps "0 0 1" from the parent for a namespace
  created by a task without CAP_SETFCAP, that namespace can no longer
  write fscaps honoured outside
- PTRACE_ATTACH and PTRACE_TRACEME fail when the tracer gave up
  CAP_SETFCAP and CAP_SYS_PTRACE, the target didn't, and they share a
  root user

Rootless containers, privileged runtimes writing the map from the
parent, nested unprivileged namespaces and containers that don't map
host uid 0 aren't affected.  The ptrace check is one compare for
targets in the initial namespace and in namespaces entered without
the capability.

Testing: a set of flows run on the base and patched kernels, every
bypass route above gets -EPERM with the series and the 16 legitimate
flows behave the same.  The capabilities, namespaces, ptrace, pidfd and
proc selftests give the same results before and after. Thanks,

Josef
