Ok, my proposal seems to be a no-go and so I will follow your proposal given
above.

Just to clarify, correct me if I am wrong.

When read if we encountered a skippable unknown tag (this is possible if
version > FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION), we just skip the tag without any
error.

For write, "we always error if version > FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION".
If fdt_open_into() has been called before the write operation, this will
not happen. Indeed, we have downgraded the version to FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION
and removed all unknown skippable tags.

Also, during this downgrade process (downgrade version + remove skippable
unknown tags), if a unknown tag that cannot be skipped is found, the downgrade
process fails an return an error.

Best regards,
Hervé
