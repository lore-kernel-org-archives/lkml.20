Yeah, no problem on my side. I would just observe the maintainers' comments 
on those before merging them.

My intention when I wrote that patch was to add a base so you could add 
HDBSS on kvm_arch_commit_memory_region() with new patch such as:

	/* Disable HAFDBS when dirty-logging starts */
	if (kvm_supports_hafdbs(kvm))
		kvm_set_hafdbs(kvm, 0);
+	else
+		kvm_enable_hdbss(kvm);
...

	/* If dirty-logging was canceled, set HAFDBS back on */
	if (kvm_supports_hafdbs(kvm) &&
	    atomic_read(&kvm->nr_memslots_dirty_logging) == 0)
		kvm_set_hafdbs(kvm, 1);
+	else
+		kvm_disable_hdbss(kvm);


That being said, I need to run tests to make sure the usage of HAFDBS 
outside of dirty_tracking makes any sense in terms of performance, but if 
that's not the case, it would be fine to rework it so it does not 
enable/disable HAFDBS there.

Awesome!

Thanks!
