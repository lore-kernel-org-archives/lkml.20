I don't think it hides it. How the chip handles multi-lane is described
by the compatible string itself. So it will be up to the IIO driver to
call the composite device creation function with the appropriate parameters
to tell it that in this case we need to assert all 4 CS in order to get
a 4-lane device. I don't think we need any extra devicetree description
for this.

I think if we put the CS lines in a logical order, we don't need any
mapping. For example:

CS | Lane
---+-----
0  |  0
1  |  2
2  |  1
3  |  3

Would just be:

reg = <0>, <2>, <1>, <3>;
