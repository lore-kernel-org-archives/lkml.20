You skip an important step. I raised the concern that the time zone
does not work for Asian developers; we should find a time zone
friendly to Asia.

Nhat still suggested the original time slot, disregarding my concern.
Which implicitly exclude Baoquan from the discussion. That is the fact
that you missed.

Then I suggested using email discussion instead, because the key
shareholder couldn't attend. There is no veto. I suggested the same
approach Nhat suggested. If you call my suggestion a veto, Nhat veto
first. Nhat issued the first veto. Mine was only a response to Nhat's
insistence.

Baoquan can't make it at 1AM. It is not a reasonable ask.

In Baoquan's own words:
"About the meeting time. I am in UTC+8. If the meeting is before 23:00
my time, I can join. If it is later than that, it is too late for me,
and I can only discuss in the mailing list."

He already made it very clear he will not be able to join that time
slot. It is not a maybe. It is a 'can't'. His reply was very clear
before you sent yours. I don't know what part of "not sure" you read
from his email. What is your motivation for twisting this?

Suggesting a 1 AM meeting without considering the time zone difference
is an understandable mistake. Insisting on that time, as Nhat and you
do, reveals more about you. Attacking me for point it out?

> You turned his "not sure" into a hard no on his behalf, then argued

It is a hard no. 1AM is not a reasonable ask in the first place. Even
after I pointed out it is not Asia friendly, Nhat is still insisting
on it. That was before I suggested we discuss it via email instead.
Get your facts straight.
