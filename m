The "important" part is this fixing something that is broken today or is
it just avoiding fallout. We don't have any memory allocations/ locking
in the mentioned window as far as I know. That would fix things, just
avoid fallout.
The wake-up in that window does record wrong flags in the recorded trace
but I am unsure if this mandates a fix-me-backport for instance.

Is this some gcc-17 thing? I don't remember that I saw it and I did test
that.

Right. I mean you have one state and this what you want test for. I
don't think it make sense to test before and after arithmetics.
I am just not sure if those warnings should be hidden behind
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT similar as preempt_count_add() does it. Maybe it is
not hot-enough-path to worry about it.

I am slightly unsure but I think we want the wakeup of the timer thread
even if we are in a bh-disabled section. If the current task is a
SCHED_OTHER then the wake-up preempt it. If the thread is already woken
then the wake-up will do nothing.

It depends if RCU uses softirq _and_ BH was disabled. So I don't see
what is wrong with that.
Anyway, one step at a time with some reasoning why.

This only matters for the threadirq case. Here invoke_softirq() will
only wake ksoftirqd and wake_timersd() will only wake the ktimers
thread. There will be no new softirqs added to the mask. This currently
is an ugly catch-all for both sides. Ideally only the softirqs raised by
task X should be handled by task X but the first one will do everything.
