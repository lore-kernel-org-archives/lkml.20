Which controller is this? AFAIK for xHCI hosts there currently is no
"ports" node specified in the common usb-hcd.yaml binding. I plan to
add this separately, as it can already be used for USB A connectors.

The kernel maps every downstream port of the root hub to a separate
node. On the XHCI it is more complicated because it has two root hubs,
one for HS and one for SS. I'm not familiar with the hardware specifics
but they seem to map into one common namespace, so you probably get
ports 1~8 for HS and then 9~12 for SS. Note the number of ports is
different. This is just an example from my x86 workstation. And on
x86 each port is mapped to a different ACPI node.

But the hardware descriptors actually give two ports, one for HS and one
for SS. And in the case of dwc3, I suspect that they always come with
one downstream HS port and (optionally) one downstream SS port. So the
binding is actually correct, except for the numbering.

I'm looking into the dwc3 case. Changing the numbering might actually
not break anything. Linux seems to just need one *a* graph connection,
but doesn't care about the number. I looked through some other projects:

- FreeBSD doesn't use the OF graph for anything
- U-boot doesn't use the OF graph for USB
- OpenBSD doesn't support dwc3, only the XHCI in dwc3, and doesn't use the
  OF graph for USB
- coreboot doesn't use the OF graph for anything
- Zephyr doesn't support dwc3
- TF-A doesn't use the OF graph for anything
- EDK2 doesn't support dwc3 and doesn't support OF graph
- OP-TEE doesn't support dwc3 and doesn't support OF graph

> But that comes with a big breakage, as always..

As I mentioned, it probably isn't as large of a breakage.
