Hi, Qiliang!

Thank you for the patch, this overall makes sense to me, just some
suggestions below.

It looks like the locked_ei parameter is no longer used. If you are
available, could you add a patch to remove it as well?

I'm a bit concerned that modifying sc->nr_scanned here could actually
end up increasing the number of scan_objects() calls in real-world
usage. If there are other background processes running and continuously
accessing certain files, they may keep producing a small number of new
reclaimable extent caches. That would mean nr_scanned stays at a
relatively small value on each iteration and never drops to 0, so
shrinker->scan_objects() may end up going through more loops because it
can't return SHRINK_STOP. So I'd tend to leave shrinkctl->nr_scanned
alone. What do you think?

This comment seems a bit verbose, could it be simplified a bit?

Thanks,
Yi.
