Hi Leo,

Thanks for your review. It does make sense!

I agree that dirty-bitmap mode will keep PAGE_SIZE as the default, and
in that mode the ioctl stays available for a larger buffer.

In ring mode we will drop the ioctl, the two remain mutually exclusive,
and the buffer will be derived from the ring size userspace configured
before the first vCPU is created:

```
hdbss_buffer = clamp_t(unsigned long,
                        rounddown_pow_of_two(ring_size / 16),
                        SZ_4K, KVM_ARM_HDBSS_MAX_SIZE);
```

A buffer entry is 8 bytes and a ring entry is 16 bytes, so:

```
buffer entries = buffer_size / 8
ring entries   = ring_size / 16
```

This means ring_size / 16 reserves at most one eighth of the ring
entries for the HDBSS buffer. That keeps the usable ring above 85% while
the buffer still grows with the configured ring size, and the result is
independent of the kernel page size, with SZ_4K as the only minimum.

One eighth is the ratio that looks reasonable to me so far. What do you
think?

Thanks,
Tian
