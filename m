Yes, this mostly works for higher CPU count domains, but the
issue I'm trying to fix basically doesn't exist in the 8 CPU domain
in the first place (first of all fewer chances of having simultaneous
slow paths running that can race and also the slow path is much faster,
i.e. the race window much smaller).

Fully removing the issue would require some synchronisation which the
numbers (which admittedly are pretty modest already) just don't justify.

And then do what? rescan?
I don't think increasing the slow path is justified at all, when this relatively
straightforward randomization already significantly reduces the chance
for the 'pathological' test platform.
