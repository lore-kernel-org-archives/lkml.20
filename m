This may be the answer to the question that I was asking Justin, lets
see if we can unpack it a bit for those of us that are dense.

Big picture, as Justin so elegantly pointed out, there are a bunch of
things that eBPF cannot do now, and may never be able to do in the
future, particularily when it comes to 'raceless free' path based
security controls, ie. TOCTOU avoidance.

So, the objective is to have a program, systemd for example, compose a
set of different security policies, that it then hands out to various
process heirarchies, which then uses eBPF to call LandLock kernel
internals to do the heavy security lifting with kernel level
privileges and capabilities, particularily when it comes to path based
controls.

Is that close?

If so, the question remains, why take on this amount of drama?

Something like systemd does at least 10,000 other things, composing
and handing out multiple variants of file descriptor based process
hierarchy security policies would seem like chump change to it.

I'm assuming the answer is that the eBPF programs involved are going
to be implementing other, perhaps proprietary, security controls that
extend beyond the path based controls that eBPF can't do.

We will be interested in your reflections.
