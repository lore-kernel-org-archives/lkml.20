Not necessarily. But does the ordering matter? If I run:

$ sudo trace-cmd record -e bpf_trace:bpf_trace_printk \
                        -f 'bpf_string ~ "rv: violation: *"'

it does not matter if the instance is running before or after starting
the monitor.

This is interesting because it is very likely that the RV monitor is
attaching to and generating the violation from the same tracepoints that
I may be additionally tracing. For example, the sleep RV monitor
attaches to sched_waking, which I would also use while investigating my
broken real-time system.

However, I just ran a test with a simple eBPF program that attaches to a
tracepoint and calls bpf_trace_printk(). I started trace-cmd to trace
both the attach tracepoint and also bpf_trace_printk using a glob. After
starting trace-cmd, I loaded/attached the eBPF program. The running
trace-cmd was able to capture both events (with about 15us difference in
timestamp).

Thank you for making this suggestion. This is the direction I would
prefer we take.

Since relocating RV to userspace requires an enormous amount of effort
and coordination (mainlining, packaging, distributions, documentation),
I do not think it makes sense to have an "initial implementation" that
is already not what we want in the long term.
