that's how the event core's synchronization is designed and expect the
PMU drivers to follow. so the race is true if pmu::read() is not protected
in the current implementation.

so the problematic part is that the counter update from the overflow
interrupt is not guaranteed to run on the event->cpu for the first
even if the affinity is set to event->cpu, due to IMSIC's affinity
move deferral. this should only affect IOMMU implemented as PCIe
device, not platform device with either wired interrupt or MSI.

what was the problem of using irq work to queue the counter update
on the event->cpu? I see it was removed in v10 due to IRQCHIP_MOVE_DEFERRED
which confused me. with irq work we can ensure the counter update
on event->cpu no matter which cpu take the interrupt. was there
other issues with the irq work?

thanks.
