Hello Xu,

thanks for the review, and sorry for the confusion. Answers below, I will
send the v5 after you agree...

What I want is, to deassert both signals in probe, and asserted them
only around the data transfer in xilinx_selectmap_write().

With v4 code does this already, just my comments / commit message is
misleading... sorry.

My above sentence in the commit message is wrong, you are correct. I drop
it in v5. Nothing here depends on the DTS. The flag handed to

devm_gpiod_get_optional()

is a logical value, not a line level. gpiod_direction_output_nonotify()
does

         if (test_bit(GPIOD_FLAG_ACTIVE_LOW, &flags))
                 value = !value;

and Documentation/driver-api/gpio/consumer.rst states it as well:

         Note that the initial value is *logical* and the physical line
         level depends on whether the line is configured active high or
         active low

So GPIOD_OUT_HIGH means "asserted", on every board. The current driver
asserts CSI_B and RDWR_B in probe and leaves them asserted for the
lifetime of the device, which is a bad idea in case you have more
devices sharing one bus, and this patch fixes this issue.

The problem is two (or more) FPGAs sharing one SelectMAP data bus, which
is the case CSI_B exists for. With current driver both of them are selected
after probe all the time, so every byte written for one is clocked into
the other as well, and neither can be configured on its own.

With a single FPGA on the port the permanent assertion is harmless. That
FPGA is the only device on the bus, so it may stay selected, and the
driver never reads from it, so the port may stay in write mode.

I would change v5 commit message to:
"""
     The driver requests the optional CSI_B and RDWR_B GPIOs with
     GPIOD_OUT_HIGH and never touches them again. That flag carries a
     logical value, so both signals end up asserted on every board,
     whatever polarity the device tree states.

     Keeping them asserted works as long as a single FPGA owns the
     SelectMAP port. That FPGA is the only device on the bus, so it may
     stay selected, and the driver never reads from it, so the port may
     stay in write mode.

     It stops working as soon as two FPGAs share one SelectMAP data bus,
     which is the case CSI_B exists for. Both devices are selected all
     the time, so every byte written for one of them is clocked into the
     other as well, and neither can be configured on its own.

     CSI_B (Chip Select) selects the target FPGA. Assert it before the
     configuration data is transferred and deassert it afterwards, so that
     only the intended device sees the bus cycles.

     RDWR_B (Read/Write) selects the transfer direction on the SelectMAP
     interface. Assert it for the write cycles that carry the bitstream and
     deassert it afterwards. UG570 wants RDWR_B settled before CSI_B is
     asserted, a change while the device is selected aborts the
     configuration on the next CCLK.

     Both are requested with GPIOD_OUT_LOW now, the logical 0 that leaves
     them deasserted, and their descriptors are kept in the driver private
     data.

     A board with one FPGA keeps working. SelectMAP allows the bitstream to
     be loaded non-continuously, with CSI_B deasserted between the data
     transfers, and a deselected device ignores the bus.

Agreed, and that comment is what causes the confusion. Active low is a
property of the board, gpiolib hides it, and the driver never needs to
know it. GPIOD_OUT_LOW is the logical 0, which is the deasserted state,
and for a line the firmware marks active low gpiolib drives it high.
GPIOD_OUT_HIGH would assert the signal, which is what I want to fix.

So I will rewrite the comments in probe for v5 to:
"""
         /*
          * Request both signals deasserted, so a device sharing the SelectMAP
          * bus with others stays off that bus until its bitstream is written.
          *
          * The value in the gpiod flags is logical, gpiolib drives the line
          * high for GPIOD_OUT_LOW when the firmware describes it active low.
          */
         conf->csi_b = devm_gpiod_get_optional(&pdev->dev, "csi",
                                               GPIOD_OUT_LOW);
"""

Many thanks!
