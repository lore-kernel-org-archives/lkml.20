Ok, I send the v5 soon.

They do not, you are right. I first thought to solve it "easy" with
a mutex around the write... but nothing tells the driver which managers
share a port.

Two managers on one port and two managers on two ports look exactly the
same from inside the driver. And so we may we lock the write unnecessary...

I have to think about...
