My take is that if you're using the i3cdev module, it's up to the
programmer to review schematics/datasheets to know how to program
the hardware devices and bus (in the case of hubs) correctly.

Note, this thread's driver_override approach was not favored by the i3c
subsystem reviewers, so please continue any further discussion in the
prevailing approach's thread:

Andy, we're considering an I3C character device driver interface.
If you have any feedback from your experience with I2C, can you
please share it in:

I'm supporting a kernel running on accelerator cards that plug into
various server SKUs where hubs/devices along the bus are not physically
on the card & may differ across SKUs. So, I'm looking to program hubs
flexibly and dynamically from userspace to setup bus hardware paths.

The hub drivers being posted to i3c subsystem require hard-coding in the
devicetree to setup the ports physically according to intended
bus/hardware design. As mentioned, these cards will not know what SKU it
will be plugged into, so the devicetree hard-coding cannot reasonably be
determined ahead of time. Theoretically, you may be able to add some
bootloader support to go query SKU information from other server
components and then populate the devicetree for the kernel, but that
will require heavy lifting and plumbing between other server firmware
components and the bootloader.

Further replies and discussion can be routed here:
