I have not done a thorough code review yet, and will focus on the
general approach.

I am generally in favor of this approach where we keep track of the
directory inode plus the file name.

Other projects that have run into the problem before are:

(1) Justine Tunney's Landlocked Make experiment
    (https://github.com/jart/landlock-make).  This one shares the same
    "build system" problem, I believe the topic came up during code
    review at the time.

    So I think this is a general problem in build systems that use
    Landlock.

(2) Michael Stapelberg's Go rsync implementation.

    https://github.com/gokrazy/rsync/commit/f85bc9b98cdda705ff8e76ebcd8fba03c6560467

In the rsync case, the issue is not a rule for *creation*, but for
*reading* files.  But it could still be resolved with the same
mechanism: When allow-listing the /etc/resolv.conf file, the policy
works for a while, but eventually a system-level network management
daemon might exchange the file for a new one with an atomic rename,
changing the inode number.  It would be desirable to express a policy
in this case as well, which is tied to the /etc inode plus the
"resolv.conf" filename, for opening files for reading.

The same problem also exists for allow-listing of Pathname Unix Domain
Sockets, where the common way to restart these is to unlink the socket
file and recreate it during bind(2).

In both cases, the best current workaround is to grant the access
right on the parent directory, which is arguably often granting more
than necessary.

Do you think your patch would generalize for the non-creation use
cases as well?

I only had a short look so far, but stumbled across the words "package
store" / "store" etc.  In other packaging systems, I have not come
across the term "package store" before.  In the kernel code, please
let's not assume that readers have a familiarity with Nix, and let's
please explain features in more general terms.  (Note to self, on
review, grep for the word "store".)

(FWIW, I suspect that this wording might have been put there by an AI.
I've observed in the past that AIs sometimes have an unfortunate
tendency to blur the lines between abstraction layers and
cross-reference implementation internals across abstraction layers.
Maybe something to watch out for?)

Is that a preexisting problem that predates your patch?

We are already hooking into hook_path_mknod(), hook_path_symlink()
etc.  Is the feature not possible based on that hook as well?

In fact, I would have assumed that you would only need to change the
logic in the path walk so that it can pick up the special rule type?
Does that not work?

Landlock does generally provide the normal semantics when you use
files through an OverlayFS mount.  We have exhaustive tests for it in
fs_test.c as well.

>   Should it get none instead?

Please see the logic and discussions around the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER access right: When linking or renaming a file
to a new location, we must make sure that a landlocked program can not
move it to a place where it suddenly has more access rights on the
file because it is now accessible under different parent directories.

Thanks,
