No, I mean just have the SGX firmware tell the OS if it produced a
DICE or legacy blob :(

Even the remote helper needs to tell the two cases apart so it can
parse them

Again if you expected the user to pre-tell the helper that this is a
legacy vs DICE VM then that's exactly the bad user experiance I want
to avoid.

Yes, completely normal. The thing that generates the data should have
an unambiguous contract with the OS on what kind of data it will
generate.

If you want to change it, thats fine, but the OS participates in the
change and is aware of it.

I don't know what you guys have done here. There are IETF standards
for all of this and well defined container formats. Sure to parse
every bit of the token you might need a new library, but you should at
least be able to get a signature verified and parse the generic
information reliably.

If your plan is TDX releases are ABI incompatible with the verifiers,
then thats a horrible plan and *much* worse than what ARM is doing,
for instance.

But it sounds like your library can somehow parse the blob and figure
it out, so maybe it is just a matter of describing how that works.

It is not local quote processing. This is labeling data properly so a
verifier is possible without the user having to manually and directly
inform the system what versions of Intel CPUs and TDX modules it
should expect to have.

I would hope for no dependency, the idea would be to provide
references for anyone wanting to make verifier software, and a tool
for the admin that wants to debug/understand their systems..

As well as a point to have a strict injection of sanity into what
people are doing so we don't get repeated ABI breaking instances in
future.
