Hi Farid,

Thanks for this RFC.  The Nix build sandbox is definitely a valid use
case for Landlock.

I didn't have time to do a full review of your patches yet, but I'll do
that next week.  In the meantime, I have a few questions:

Did you do this benchmark with this series?  Do you have the related
code to easily reproduce it?

I'm wondering if the Nix build sandbox can create the store dir per
build before the actual build.  Isn't already the case with the bind
mount?

Only the sandbox creator should pay for the related kernel memory
allocations, and this should be at creation time.

Another property that would be nice is that if a sandboxed process can
create a file, the related policy should also make it possible to delete
this file.  Is that the case with the current approach?  We need to
think not only about the lifetime of the sandbox, but about consecutive
creations of such sandboxes by/for the same program.
