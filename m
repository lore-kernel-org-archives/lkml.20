We still have some issues for bpftool related to libbfd: for Debian
packaging, building against the shared libbfd is "Not Allowed" [0]. This
was one of the motivations for introducing the use of LLVM as an
alternative dependency. I didn't know elfutils offered a similar
feature, I should look into it.

Thanks for all the context, very much appreciated! I agree, sticking to
the zlib + zstd variant sounds like a good option for now, thanks.
