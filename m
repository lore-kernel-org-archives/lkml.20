First, wait for human review. Always.

Second, read Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst

"Wait for a minimum of one week before resubmitting or pinging reviewers
- possibly longer during busy times like merge windows."

Because we have much other priorities right now :)

Before I reply to anything in here: did an LLM compose most of these walls of
