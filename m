If it would be safe to apply patches 2 and 3 without patch 1, I could
go ahead and do that.

Patch 2 returns errors from pci_save_state() in more cases, but
hcd_pci_suspend_noirq() doesn't check for errors anyway, so I think
it's would be no worse off it we applied patch 2 without patch 1.

And patch 3 looks like it's probably safe by itself independent of the
others.
