I still want to better understand the real world use case before digging into
the specific solution.  But, I was thinking perf event based monitoring might
not feasible for the case.  If that's the case, I think extending data
attributes monitoring for splitting pmd mapping be fore the access check might
be a path forward.

That is, we can request DAMON to do some preparation action for the data
attribute sampling, using damon_prep.  At the moment, set_pgidle prep action is
supported.  Maybe we could add a new prep action, say, split_pmd?  Then, the
following sampling memory access check probe (would be a kind of "allow
pidle_unset" probe filter) will be able to show the access on exactly the pte
accessed bit, not the pmd accessed bit.

Breaking pmd would cause the overhead, but it would be capped by the
max_nr_regions.  So the user could at least consider about the tradeoff.  I
think this is simpler and more intuitive than DAMOS-based pmd breaking, at
least.
