please trim that commit message A LOT :-) .

You're just adding the nodes for the NPU cores, that does
not need a novel-sized commit message.


Additionally, please split this into two commits:
=2D Adding the resets to the power-domains
=2D Adding the nodes for the NPU cores (add pd_npu phandle here too)


Thanks a lot
Heiko
