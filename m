Hi Bjorn, Lukas,

Thanks for the pointer. I ran that experiment on the same
MacBookPro16,1.

Kernel: v7.3-rc6 (a90ee4305c4a) plus exactly the two top commits of
l1k/linux aer_unbound, and nothing else (no T2 patches, no revert, no
diagnostic parameter):

  9ce840949ee9 PCI/ERR: Always notify drivers of slot reset
  db16ca536fd0 PCI/ERR: Allow unbound devices to recover from
               Uncorrectable Errors

The first one conflicts trivially in drivers/pci/pcie/err.c on rc6
(the TODO comment in its context is already gone); I resolved it by
making the same removal. The second applied cleanly. Same trimmed
config and boot recipe as my earlier bisect (console only, no
graphical session).

Result: the machine still loses power. It answered over ssh at about
16 s of uptime and the journal of that boot ends at 16.9 s with no
shutdown sequence. Unmodified v7.3-rc6 powered off at 16.7 s in my
earlier test, so these two commits make no difference here.

So on this machine the failure is not the "link reset before a
driver is bound" case from Alex's report. As in my earlier tests no
AER error message is logged before the power loss (only the usual
"OS assumes control of AER" line) and the Uncorrectable Error Status
registers are clear.

For reference, the earlier result with a diagnostic boot parameter
that leaves the Advisory Non-Fatal bit masked per device:

  masked only on 04:00.2 (Apple T2 Secure Enclave, 106b:1802):
      stays up (120 s)
  masked only on 04:00.0 and 04:00.1 (NVMe, T2 Bridge):
      power off at 14 s
  masked on all four Apple functions 04:00.0-.3: stays up (343 s)

So here the trigger is unmasking Advisory Non-Fatal Errors on that
one function. It looks like a second, separate way for
eddba19b8b5f to hurt a platform.

Would you accept a quirk that keeps the bit masked on Apple
106b:1802? I am happy to write and test that, or any other patch you
would like tried on this machine, and I can send lspci -vvv and the
journals.

Thanks,
Jason
