That brings up a point..

Today, vcpu->arch.cpu_caps[] is capped by kvm_cpu_caps[] (plus a few special
cases).  As mentioned in the cover letter, this patch series doesn't enforce
consistency between KVM's view and the guest's view of vCPU capabilities because
KVM doesn't currently use its own view to make decisions for TDs (e.g.
saving/restoring feature-related MSRs).

However, if KVM starts making decisions for TDX based on vcpu->arch.cpu_caps[],
intersecting userspace input with kvm_cpu_caps[] will not work for TDX.  I think
this is probably needed in the future?  If so, allowing features outside of
kvm_cpu_caps[] for TDX means we will need TDX-specific handling to construct
KVM's view of vCPU capabilities.  That likely implies tracking all
known/supported TDX features, which is doable, but it will make the allow list
bigger.
