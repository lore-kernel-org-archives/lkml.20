At Honeycomb, a container that reads from Kafka and writes columnar
files to a host volume stalls for 30-60s after each deploy replaces it
(v6.18). We're increasingly confident this is the cause: the stall
looks the same as in the reproducer (little CPU use, lag growing
linearly and then recovering), and the mitigation it predicts, moving
our final syncfs after the last write, worked in production (below).
We haven't caught it with probes in production yet.

Patch 1 is a prep fix: switching a dirty inode away left the old wb
counted in bdi->tot_write_bandwidth. Patch 2 keeps killed wbs in
bdi->cgwb_tree until they are released, so foreign flushes can still
reach them. Patch 3 handles the other way a wb leaves the tree: when a
memcg's blkcg association changes and a new wb takes over the slot, it
switches the old wb's inodes, dirty or not, to the new one.

Applies to mainline (5d144c294ae2) and vfs-7.4.misc. Tested on
vfs-7.4.misc and on mainline (d24e8ac715de, 7.3-rc6) with 168a8c13159c,
where patch 2's test gave 1.0s, 2.2s, 1.1s, 1.0s and 1.0s worst lag in
five runs. Patch 3's loop follows 407a5d205179, and f6988c90671e bounds
its rescans.

Syncing before the removal isn't enough: cleanup_offline_cgwbs_workfn()
skips a dying wb with any dirty inode and only retries on the next memcg
offline. On ext4, syncfs can leave inodes I_DIRTY_SYNC: at 5000 files
one syncfs still stalled in 7 of 9 runs (19-26s worst lag), a second
syncfs avoided it in 5 of 5, and with this series one syncfs lagged at
most 1.5s in 2 of 2. On XFS one syncfs left the wb clean in 5 of 5 runs,
but a single 4KiB append from the old cgroup after it stranded the wb
again (15-28s worst lag, 5 of 5; 1.2-1.6s in 2 of 2 with this series).
In production, our writer synced after closing its data files but before
writing its final Kafka offset to a small shutdown file, and moving the
syncfs after that write mitigated the stall for us on XFS. In the
reproducer, a 14-byte file written after the syncfs stranded the wb the
same way, whether created directly or via a temp file and rename (16-29s
worst lag, 7 of 7; with this series, 1.0-1.4s in 2 of 2 created
directly); an empty file did not.

The harness that produced the numbers (paced writer, lag per second,
MODE=alive control) is at
https://gist.github.com/lizthegrey/2209d831930588f63076bdc0ac7b78e2, and
a minimal recipe is below. Settings for all numbers: MEM_MAX=max
POD_MAX=4G RATE_MBPS=250, plus NFILES=5000 SYNC_OLD=1 (or 2) and
DIRTY_AFTER=1 or SHUTDOWN_FILE=offset|offset_rename|empty for the syncfs
runs and NFILES=500000 OLD_SECS=120 SYNC_OLD=1 POD_HOP=10 for the
500k-file runs.

Also reproduced unpatched on bare-metal arm64 with Ubuntu's 7.0 kernel
(ext4 on a loop device): 12.9s worst lag with the old cgroup removed,
2.5s with it kept.

Tested: arm64 KVM guests (virtme-ng), ext4 and XFS on virtio, on
vfs-7.4.misc and on mainline with 168a8c13159c. No KASAN, lockdep,
PROVE_RCU, DEBUG_LIST, DEBUG_OBJECTS_WORK, DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP or
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC reports, including a stress run toggling io on the
parent of two writers 40 times so their wbs are killed and replaced in
the same slot (240 calls of patch 3's switch, 16200 inode switches,
counted with bpftrace), and the patch 1 and 3 tests in their changelogs
and the race test below. W=1 and checkpatch --strict clean, no new
sparse warnings. All changes are under CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK, and only
builds with it enabled were done for v6.

Not tested: x86 runtime, this series in production, linux-next, and
patch 3's fallback for a successor that is already gone (not reachable
on demand; it is cleanup_offline_cgwb()'s loop).

Workaround until this lands: syncfs after the old container's last
write (twice on ext4). Lowering vm.dirty_expire_centisecs from 3000 to
500 cut the worst lag on unpatched mainline to 4.8s, 4.6s and 14.3s, but
did not remove the stall.

Related: without 168a8c13159c the flush is sized from the dead memcg's
own dirty pages, so this only helps while it has some. f6988c90671e
(mainline) also matters: on XFS with 500k synced inodes and the pod
cgroup removed 10s later, the handover was slow enough without it that
the replacement fell 21-22s behind (vfs-7.4.misc), against 1.0-1.2s with
it (mainline), both with v1 of this series.

In patch 3's test all 5001 inodes switched within 27-39ms, and on
mainline the sibling lagged at most 1.1s. As with today's per-inode
switches, switched inodes land at the newest end of the new wb's b_dirty
with their old dirtied_when, so periodic writeback may reach them up to
dirty_expire_centisecs late; background and foreign flushes are
unaffected.

To test the re-kick in patch 3, a debug-only delay in
inode_switch_wbs_work_fn() held back foreign switches to a memcg's wb
until after io was disabled on its parent, a new wb took over its slot
and the memcg was removed. With v5, the 61, 62 and 19 inodes that then
landed on the replaced wb stayed there until the next memcg offline ran
cleanup_offline_cgwbs_workfn(); with v6, all 5, 35 and 82 that landed
were queued to the successor as they landed, checked by wb pointer with
bpftrace. Switches queued after the takeover went to the successor
directly. The inodes were clean by the time they landed, so this shows
where they end up, not a stall. On the lockdep kernel, the re-kick moved
165, 82 and 198 inodes from the replaced wb to the successor in three
runs.

Developed with Claude Opus 5.5, which wrote the code, the reproducers
and first drafts of this text, and ran the builds and VM tests. Claude
Fable 5.1 reviewed the code and the claims in this text before v2 to v6
were posted. I drove the investigation from the production symptoms,
designed the experiments and controls (repeated runs, parent-commit
baselines, testing this patch on its own), and reviewed the analysis,
code and results.

Minimal recipe:
	#!/bin/bash
	# As root, cgroup v2, in a directory on ext4/xfs/btrfs ($DIR).
	cg=/sys/fs/cgroup/wbmini
	mkdir $cg && echo +memory > $cg/cgroup.subtree_control
	echo 4G > $cg/memory.max
	mkdir $cg/old $cg/new
	append() {  # append $1 blocks of $2 to each of 1000 files
		for i in $(seq 1000); do
			dd if=/dev/zero of=$DIR/f$i bs=$2 count=$1 \
			   oflag=append conv=notrunc status=none
		done
	}
	(echo $BASHPID > $cg/old/cgroup.procs
	 append 8 1M            # old owner writes the files...
	 append 1 64k)          # ...and exits with all of them dirty
	rmdir $cg/old           # its cgroup goes away while they are dirty
	bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:cgroup_writeback_by_id {
		@ret[(int32)retval] = count(); }' &
	sleep 3
	time (echo $BASHPID > $cg/new/cgroup.procs
	      append 4 1M)      # replacement keeps appending to the same files
	kill -INT $!; wait
	rmdir $cg/new $cg
	# Unpatched: many @ret[-2] (-ENOENT) and the append stalls.
	# Patched: @ret[0] only.
