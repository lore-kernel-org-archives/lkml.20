Basically, yes, the idea is to defer the creation of the platform
device until the dependency is met.

Well, good question.

I think what you need is a notification mechanism that will trigger
when a specific device (enumerated via the ACPI Namespace) becomes
operational.  It doesn't look like any of the existing ones (platform
device probe deferral or ACPI device dependencies tracking) is really
suitable for your use case.

If it has to work under these conditions anyway, then adding stuff to
the namespace is rather pointless.
