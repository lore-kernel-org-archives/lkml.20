Oh, duh, the hotplug hack allows using the x2APIC ID even if the target isn=

in x2APIC mode.

Don't bother testing my patch, my brain was slow to catch on.

Agreed, though I think we tie the overide to "xapic_id <=3D 0xff" instead o=
f letting
the "lower" vCPU win.  I.e. to make it a bit more obvious that the goal is =
to keep
the non-truncated xAPIC ID reachable.

Ha!  Yeah, looking at 5bd5db385b3e ("KVM: x86: allow hotplug of VCPU with A=
PIC ID
over 0xff"), it had:

                /*
                 * ... xAPIC ID of VCPUs with APIC ID > 0xff will wrap-arou=
nd,
                 * prevent them from masking VCPUs with APIC ID <=3D 0xff.
                 */
                if (!apic_x2apic_mode(apic) && !new->phys_map[xapic_id])
                        new->phys_map[xapic_id] =3D apic;

so the goal really was to prevent an truncated x2APIC ID from clobbering a =
"pure"
xAPIC ID.

Actually, even better: what if we only let the vCPU whose ID exactly matche=
s the
aliased xAPIC ID win?  Unless I've gone into the weeds yet again, that's wh=
at we
(and more importantly, userspace and guest firmware) really want.  It shoul=
dn't
matter in practice, but it lets KVM provide a stronger, and hopefully easie=
r to
understand, guarantee in the errata.
