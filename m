Subject: [PATCH v2 08/10] mm/shmem_luo: Allow preserving tmpfs files that are

shmem_luo already accepts any shmem file without links, which includes
unlinked tmpfs files and files created with O_TMPFILE. Also accept tmpfs
files that are still linked, so that userspace doesn't have to unlink
files to preserve them and can keep using them by path until the live
update.

The path of the file isn't preserved. Like other files from tmpfs
mounts, a linked file is retrieved onto a tmpfs mount chosen by
userspace, which can then link it at the path it wants.

While a file is preserved, its size is frozen, so truncating it,
fallocate() and writes past its end fail with -EPERM. For a linked file,
this affects everyone who opens the file by its path, so a caller that
can only read the file, e.g. a world-readable file in /dev/shm, could
use it to break the owner of the file. So require permission to write to
the file to preserve it, for all files. Like FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY, don't
require a file opened for writing, so that binaries that are being
executed can still be preserved through read-only fds, nor a writable
mount. If the size of the file can't change anyway, because it is
immutable or on a read-only superblock, also let its owner preserve it.
Don't let others do that, since the size could change again once the
file is made writable.

Preserving a file also fills its holes, but don't require any permission
for that. Anyone who can read a tmpfs file can already fill its holes by
faulting them in through a read-only mapping, also on read-only mounts
and for immutable files.

Document the frozen size and the permission requirement.
