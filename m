Those should as safe as it gets.

The honor user alignment request change would be safe as well when it=20
comes to not yet hitting the regression territory but since I've not=20
tested intermediate configurations that extensively I'd keep it either-or=
=20
for the rest.

The regression is the same genoa iomem blackhole we discussed in the v3=20
thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20261013130948.6231-9-ilpo.jarvinen@linux=
=2Eintel.com
/

There were multiple possible possible ways to quirk this and it comes down=
=20
to which one you (Bjorn) prefer. I just left my quirk patch out of these=20
v4 and v5 series because it seemed the least likely to be the one taken.

If you want me to test a specific quirk approach on the affected system,=20
just let me know. I already did test reverting your change that freed the=
=20
e820 reserved regions for iomem use and that did prevent the regression.


(I now seem to realize I forgot to include Mario while sending v5. I've=20
added him to this now.)

Mario was willing to pursue contacting the reporters of the earlier=20
problems with a pre-prepared branch to test to see if my placement series=
=20
could resolve the issues reported (earlier). Depending the results of that=
=20
test, we might have yet another way to quirk it.

Mario,

There were quite many changes in v5 so I'd prefer the test branch using=20
v5.
