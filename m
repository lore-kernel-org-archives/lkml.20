Subject: [PATCH v2 00/10] fdtfactor: Introduce fdtfactor to auto-factor overlays

Devicetree overlays exist at both the source level (via `/include/` and
`.dtsi` files) and the binary level (where a compiled `.dtbo` overlay is
applied to a "base" `.dtb` at runtime to add or modify nodes).

Binary `.dtbo` overlays were created by transcribing source-level
overlay semantics to `.dtb` blobs to serve two main use cases:

1. Supporting add-on boards (like "hats" on a dev board), where a base
   board's `.dtb` is combined with an add-on board's `.dtbo` at boot or
   runtime (a use case that Hervé Codina's upcoming "addons" work aims
   to model more cleanly).

2. Allowing constrained bootloaders or firmware images to support a
   "family" of similar boards in a space-efficient way without shipping
   a full `.dtb` for every variant. In upstream Linux, for example,
   there are 47 distinct sc7180-trogdor boards supported. At the source
   level these boards share common `.dtsi` files, but we still compile
   (and ship) 47 separate full `.dtb` blobs. Binary devicetree overlays
   can make this much more efficient by factoring the common bits into a
   single base `.dtb` and representing each of the 47 boards as a small
   `.dtbo` overlay.

Even though `.dtbo` overlay semantics are a natural fit for case #2
(since they derive from source-level `.dts` overlays, which were
designed for board/SoC families), upstream Linux has mostly reserved
compiled `.dtso` -> `.dtbo` overlays for case #1. Many Android phones
attempt to use `.dtso` overlays for case #2 by describing the SoC as the
base devicetree and describing boards in `.dtso` overlays, but forcing
the binary base/overlay split into the source files has drawbacks: there
is still lots of duplication between board overlays, and upstream
reception towards structuring board source files this way has been
lukewarm [1].

This patch series introduces a tool to decouple binary `.dtbo`
generation from `.dts` source structure. The idea (suggested by Konrad
Dybcio at LPC) is to continue to represent all the boards in a family as
normal standalone device trees in source code (using `.dtsi` includes as
makes sense for human readability). Then, after building the full `.dtb`
blobs, `fdtfactor` automatically factors them into a common base `.dtb`
and a set of per-board `.dtbo` overlays.

This tool has quite a few advantages over other solutions:
1. No change to the way device trees are stored / arranged upstream.
2. No need to deal with some of the awkwardness / limitations of
   overlays.
3. Better savings than just a simple partitioning, like between SoC and
   boards.

I've used this tool to reduce sc7180-trogdor device tree files (which
are stored lz4 compressed) from 1.71 MB to 213 KB, an 87.5% savings.

To compare against the manual SoC-base + board-overlay split used by
downstream Android kernels, I also tested `fdtfactor -S` on the
downstream Pixel 10 family device trees (29 physical hardware board
variants: 27 phone variants across Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10
Pro XL plus 2 socketed dev board variants) by combining the downstream
base + overlays into full board DTBs and re-factoring them with
`fdtfactor -S`:

* Just B0 silicon (29 boards):
  - Full unfactored DTBs (29 `.dtb`s): 26.30 MB uncompressed (5.28 MB
    lz4)
  - Downstream manual SoC base (`lga-b0.dtb`) + 29 board `.dtbo`s:
    8.06 MB uncompressed (1.66 MB lz4)
  - Auto-factored with `fdtfactor -S` (1 `base.dtb` + 29 `.dtbo`s):
    3.27 MB uncompressed (668 KB lz4) -- 2.48x smaller than the manual
    SoC split (and 3.68x smaller across the 27 phone boards alone, where
    average overlay size drops from 252 KB to 44 KB uncompressed, or
    52 KB to 9.1 KB lz4).

* Both A0 and B0 SoC steppings:
  In practice, phone Proto boards (8 variants) only ever use A0 silicon,
  phone EVT1.1+ boards (15 variants) only ever use B0 silicon, and only
  phone EVT1 boards (4 variants) and the socketed dev boards (2
  variants) can have either A0 or B0 silicon -- giving 35 realistic
  (board, stepping) combinations (14 A0 + 21 B0), compared to 58 for a
  naive 29 x 2 cross-product:
  - Full unfactored DTBs (35 `.dtb`s): 31.71 MB uncompressed (6.37 MB
    lz4)
  - Downstream manual split (2 SoC bases `lga-a0.dtb` + `lga-b0.dtb` +
    29 board `.dtbo`s): 8.78 MB uncompressed (1.79 MB lz4)
  - Auto-factored with `fdtfactor -S` (1 shared `base.dtb` + 35
    `.dtbo`s): 4.00 MB uncompressed (855 KB lz4). This could likely be
    improved more with multiple levels of overlays, but we're already
    2x smaller than what downstream is doing today.

NOTE: on Chromebooks like sc7180-trogdor, using overlays like this is
an optimization. On Android phones like Pixel 10, the bootloader logic
bakes in the need for overlays. Specifically, if we want to be able to
build a single image that supports multiple boards and have the
bootloader auto-construct the right devicetree, we need the boards to be
represented by overlays. This fdtfactor tool can make that a reality.

The fdtfactor tool can either work directly on a set of compiled
devicetree files or it can work on a FIT (flattened image tree) file.
The idea is that you'd create the FIT file containing all of the
duplicated devicetree files and then fdtfactor would "optimize" them.

Before introducing `fdtfactor` itself, the series starts with a few
preparatory patches: adding Python iterators and a `NodeTree` live-tree
abstraction to `pylibfdt`, and teaching `libfdt`'s `fdt_overlay_apply()`
to update `/__local_fixups__` on the base tree so overlays can be
applied in multiple stages.

I'll freely admit that the patches in this series were pretty heavily
vibe coded. I'll not pretend that I have a deep understanding of the
intricacies of how overlays are implemented. That being said:
* I've spent quite a bit of time reviewing the code from a high-level
  perspective: confirming that functions are well documented, well
  structured, and make sense.
* I believe that what the tool is doing and how the tool is used make
  sense.
* I have had quite a number of internal "the AI reviews the AI" rounds
  to the point of diminishing returns.
At this point, I'm not embarrassed to put my name behind this. While I
won't promise that there are zero cases of the AI doing something really
stupid, I'd be willing to bet that the end result is better (and cleaner
/ better structured) than what I would have coded up if I had spent a
few weeks doing this on my own.
