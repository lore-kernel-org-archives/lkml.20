Right.  I understand why these are both desirable.  However (b) is
pretty tricky, because of the question of invalidation.  It
necessarily involves a tradeoff between how much can be preserved
versus what sorts of information future tags can carry.

Great summary, thanks.

Sadly, that doesn't work.  We have to downgrade on property
modification for the same reason we must downgrade on adding a
property: it might be adding data that requires certain tags in the
later version.

Right, if we did that it would basically mean totally (and
incompatibly) redesigning the libfdt interface.

Unlike (2), I'm not certain if this one is unsafe.  But I suspect it
might be, and having it behave differently from case (2) seems
confusing to me.

Right.  "I know what I'm doing" is part of the implicit contract when
using those functions.

Not quite, as noted, but we might be able to get it there.
