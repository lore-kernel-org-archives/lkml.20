Thank you for accepting my humble suggestion, please feel free to send it when
you are ready!

last_psi_total is updated in every tuning round, as you mentioned.  But the
tuning round comes if both the scheme apply interval and the quota reset
interval are passed.  damos_adjust_quota() has the quota reset interval check.
kdamond_apply_schemes() has the apply interval check before calling
damos_adjust_quota().

'''
static void kdamond_apply_schemes(struct damon_ctx *c)
{
[...]
        damon_for_each_scheme(s, c) {
                if (time_before(c->passed_sample_intervals, s->next_apply_sis))
                        continue;
[...]
                damos_adjust_quota(c, s);
'''

'''
static void damos_adjust_quota(struct damon_ctx *c, struct damos *s)
{
[...]
        /* New charge window starts */
        if (!time_in_range_open(jiffies, quota->charged_from,
                                quota->charged_from +
                                msecs_to_jiffies(quota->reset_interval))) {
[...]
                damos_set_effective_quota(c, s);
'''

And the apply interval (or, next_apply_sis) is extended for each commit, in
damon_set_attrs().  Hence, the problem can still happen.

Sounds good!

I don't really understand the problem.  Could you please further elaborate?

Sounds good.  Looking forward to your next patch!
