So I can relate to that, but ...

mac80211 has the same problem? How would *it* hold off rather than
annotating every callback from userspace, debugfs, ethtool, sysfs, and
the rest of the kernel with checks? *Maybe* at the boundary _to_ the
driver, but that's bigger than the boundary every individual driver
has...

This is what iwlwifi does, but it doesn't take *nearly* as long. :)

There might be a chance to disentangle the RTNL from this given the work
I did recently on disentangling it from cfg80211, but then on recovery
*failure* we have a problem with cfg80211_shutdown_all_interfaces().

See above - I don't see how we'd really implement the latter reliably in
mac80211? Sure, we have a bunch of in_reconfig checks, but ... I
wouldn't really trust them and I'm not sure we can guarantee them given
the surface area.
