Subject: [PATCH v1] clk: Free the parent map only in __clk_release()

clk_core_populate_parent_map() can fail in two ways, and since
__clk_register() answers every failure with kref_put(&core->ref,
__clk_release), both end in clk_core_free_parent_map() walking a parent
map that is not there to walk:

 - If the allocation of the map fails, core->parents is NULL while
   core->num_parents was already set from init->num_parents.
   clk_core_free_parent_map() only tests num_parents, so it reads
   core->parents[i].name through a NULL pointer: an oops.

 - If a later kstrdup_const() of a parent name fails, the function
   frees the names it copied so far and the map itself, but leaves
   core->parents pointing at the freed memory. __clk_release() then
   frees the same names and the same map a second time: a double free
   on top of a use-after-free read.

Both arms are the -ENOMEM path of clk_register(), clk_hw_register() and
of_clk_hw_register(), so of every clock provider in the tree with
num_parents > 0. A user sees it when a clock provider's probe hits a
memory allocation failure (in practice under fault injection, as these
allocations are small): instead of the probe failing with -ENOMEM and
"failed to register clk", the kernel oopses in __clk_release() called
from __clk_register(), or, for the second arm, corrupts the slab
allocator and reports a double free.

clk_core_populate_parent_map() has cleaned up after itself since commit
fc0c209c147f ("clk: Allow parents to be specified without string names"),
when __clk_register()'s fail_parents label skipped
clk_core_free_parent_map() and only the later fail_create_clk label
freed the map. Commit 9d05ae531c2c ("clk: Initialize struct clk_core
kref earlier") moved the freeing of everything into __clk_release() and
pointed all failure labels at kref_put(), so the map is now freed by
__clk_release() on this path too.

Make clk_core_populate_parent_map() leave the map to __clk_release():
return the error without freeing anything (the map is zero-allocated and
kfree_const(NULL) is a no-op, so the partially filled map is freed
correctly by clk_core_free_parent_map()), and have
clk_core_free_parent_map() return when there is no map rather than when
num_parents is zero, which is what clk_core_get_parent_by_index()
already does for the same state.

Found by formal verification of __clk_register() against the kernel
binary. Reproduced on riscv64 under QEMU by re-running a fixed-factor
clock provider's probe through its sysfs bind file with failslab aimed
at the parent map allocation: the unpatched kernel oopses with a NULL
pointer dereference in __clk_release() (clk_core_free_parent_map() is
inlined there), the patched kernel fails the bind write with -ENOMEM
and logs "failed to register clk". A userspace transcription of the
four functions reproduces both arms under AddressSanitizer before the
change and is clean after it. The clk KUnit suites pass before and
after on x86_64 and riscv64.

Notes:
    The riscv64 trigger is a fixed-factor-clock DT node whose registration
    fails at boot (a second node with the same clock-output-names, -EEXIST),
    which leaves an unbound platform device; writing its name to the
    driver's sysfs bind file re-runs of_clk_hw_register() in the writing
    task, where failslab with the task filter and the kmalloc-64 cache
    filter can be aimed at the parent map allocation (the second kmalloc-64
    of that probe, after struct clk_fixed_factor). On the unpatched kernel
    the oops kills the writing task with the device lock held, so the VM
    does not power off afterwards; on the patched kernel the write returns
    -ENOMEM and the next bind attempt fails with -EEXIST as before. The
    second arm (a parent name copy failing) was reproduced in the userspace
    transcription only; the fixed-factor clock has a single parent, and the
    kstrdup_const() of its name lands in a different slab cache.
    
    The pending clk-next change to __clk_register(), "clk: fix
    self-consuming provider module pinning", touches the owner assignment
    further down and does not overlap with this hunk.
