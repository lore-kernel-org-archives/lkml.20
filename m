With the empty space in between, your 64GB calculation would indeed be=20
true, but that wasn't what you said because you made an inaccurate claim=20
about window sizes being power of two in case of 32G+2M.

(I suppose we're generally in agreement here but just ended up discussion=

on finer details and the interpretation of those details.)

I'm more referring to the case where the big ReBARs cannot be assigned as=
=20
space runs out or some other BAR fails to assign because ReBAR took "too=20
much", and the numerous ripple effects from that. When that happens in=20
some system for something important breaking something, you'd have to=20
solve that problem too or this change gets reverted...

=2E..And that's why there should be proper fallback so that failing one=20
assignment somewhere middle will not result in failure in the end.

Basically, my own plan is for the algorithm to try smaller sizes until all=
=20
things fit. And all that retry logic is far from simple.
