Technically they're not quite the same thing, you can have an
overlay within a single dts file:

	/ {
		prop =3D "somthing";
	}
	/ {
		prop =3D "else";
	}

But yes, they're not very useful without includes and the dts/dtsi
split tends to match the overlay pieces.

This was where the term "overlay" originated (I believe I coined it
myself), referring to the fact that later fragments overwrite / cover
/ "overlay" the earlier fragments.

Oh, good point, the large window compressor would only help
substantially if all the overlays were compressed together.
