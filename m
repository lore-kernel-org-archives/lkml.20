I think userspace needs to know about INTERRUPTED_BY_RESET, at the very
least. But honestly, I'd keep it simple and propagate the state
regardless of the flags userspace might or might not care about.

I wouldn't worry about late signaling to be honest, the timeout is
1sec, which is way more than I would expect a DUMP request to take in
a normal situation. Now, we might want to propagate the state in that
case too, so it might make sense to return ETIMEDOUT inside the
scoped_guard, after the state has been copied.

I think we want to reset in both places, especially if we propagate the
state before the DUMP too, otherwise we might leave the
INTERRUPTED_BY_RESET bit behind even though we already informed
userspace about this event in the previous DUMP request. And yes, the
following test should have been on new_state instead of perfcnt->state,
indeed.

Yes, that's exactly what needs to be done: reset should synchronize
IRQs, mask/suspend them while the reset sequence is happening, and
unmask them when it's done. As for the completion of a DUMP request
interrupted by a RESET, we want a ret > 0 (AKA no-timeout) in that
case, but the perfcnt::state should be updated prior to that, so that
this function knows exactly what to expect from this completion: if
SESSION_INTERRUPTED_BY_RESET is set, it's likely that the DUMP didn't
complete which is why I return EAGAIN in that case, but we can also have
a dedicated flag for DUMP_COMPLETE if you want to be accurate (when
set, DUMP is effective, when not set EAGAIN).

Oh, absolutely.

If you reset it at the beginning of panfrost_perfcnt_hw_enable(), sure,
but I think it's easier to assume that when
panfrost_perfcnt_hw_enable() is called, the AS is not owned, and reset
it here instead.
