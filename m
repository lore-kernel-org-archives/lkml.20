Bear in mind that I do have patches out there, for x86 that enable prctl
for them as well. I looked into doing the lock check in the prctl call 
path before
it gets dispatched to the arch specific backend, it does require a 
common interface
into the threads feature bits that each arch would need to, trivially, 
implement.
