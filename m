Ack yeah I think I note that elsewhere, so it reduces only to the 'users doing
weird stuff' case :)

Could you implement the nesting the same in the cases where there is a bare
ctx_has_gcs() as an alternative?

So then it'd always be tcrx -> s1pie -> gcs everywhere and that'd resolve things
also and make things symmetric.

You could also I think express the dependency if it makes sense to.

Ack sure of course.

Could you possibly check in sanitise_id_aa64pfr1_el1(), something like:

diff --git a/arch/arm64/kvm/sys_regs.c b/arch/arm64/kvm/sys_regs.c
index fb2c9fd42e24..ba8780745987 100644

And that way it slots in next to the system check?

Yeah that sounds like a really neat way of solving it! And a useful idea in
general.

Yeah, I guess it's possible somebody could think they could just set a single
register and use it or something.

Yeah :(
