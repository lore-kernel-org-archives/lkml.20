And if I'd had the context of the whole series, I would have said what I 
can see now, that the entire premise is fundamentally wrong, 
irrespective of abusing the internal helper or not.

No. If a driver has attached the device to its own unmanaged IOMMU 
domain then it is using that domain, not the default domain, and thus 
has even less reason to go poking at the default domain than usual 
(where the "usual" is tenuous enough in itself). In this situation DMA 
mapping only needs to take care of non-coherent cache maintenance, and 
32-bit ARM is actually the better example here.

The fact that iommu-dma does a load of unnecessary work and returns a 
bogus DMA address just to still get the cache maintenance as a 
side-effect is a hideous inefficiency (which folks have complained about 
before...) and absolutely should not be relied upon. It needs to go 
away. There were reasons why in the original iommu_dma_ops design it was 
rather impractical to do better (in fact iommu_get_dma_domain() itself 
is largely just a hack around some of those limitations), but since 
b67483b3c44e ("iommu/dma: Centralise iommu_setup_dma_ops()") and 
particularly b5c58b2fdc42 ("dma-mapping: direct calls for dma-iommu"), 
it now really could and should be cleaned up - it just needs something 
slightly different from the standard dma-direct behaviour, as for this 
case we need to ignore the DMA mask and any bouncing conditions.

Thanks,
Robin.
