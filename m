Not yet, but if the idea does not look too crazy I can find hardware and 
collect some data :)

Humm, in nVHE would not the host kernel run in EL1?
I thought that this being a feature that depends on EL2 registers host 
would need to be in EL2 to make use of it.

That being said, I understand very little of how this works, so I 
constrained to VHE only at the start.

Would this work in nVHE?

Humm, I remember reaching the conclusion that it could not be used if the 
guest supported NV. Let's say:

L0 - Host	- Has HAFDBS enabled
L1 - Hypervisor - Has HAFDBS disabled
L2 - Guest	-

Let's say guest writes to a page, and the shadow S2 has DBM=1, so it's 
marked as WD by HAFDBS. Since no fault was taken, how would the L1 be able 
to update it's S2 pagetables to mark the page dirty?

(We would have to transverse the Shadow S2 Pagetable updating the original 
S2 pagetable)

I was wondering, thought, that we could emulate it in the last level 
hypervisor, if it's guest does not support nested guests. That would mean 
we can have the last-1 level hypervisor to update the S2 pagetable on the 
last level hypervisor without it having to fault. Ex:

L0 Host - HAFDBS disabled
[...]
Ln-1 Hypervisor - HAFDBS disabled
Ln   Hypervisor - HAFDBS enabled
Ln+1 Guest - No E2H feature

When the guest writes to a page, the host should receive a fault, that IIUC 
have to propagate down up to Ln Hyp. If Ln Hyp has HAFDBS, we could skip 
injecting a fault in Ln Hyp, as  Ln-1 Hyp could emulate HAFDBS and write 
the dirty bit to S2 pagetagle of Ln+1 guest, that resides in Ln memory.

Not sure if the troulbe would be worth, though.
Does it make sense?

Ah, that name was based on
#define kvm_vcpu_has_feature(k, f)  __vcpu_has_feature(&(k)->arch, #(f))

That takes a kvm struct to check the kvm_arch one, instead of looking into 
the vcpu. I did it like this because there were some scenarios it was not 
quite straightforward to get the vcpu to use vcpu_has_nv(), which takes a 
vcpu.


Thanks!
