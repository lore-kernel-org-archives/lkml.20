Sure...I will add more descriptive comments.

I'll see if I can split this basic support patch a bit further...

So in SCMI there are 2 types of commands synchronous and asynchronous:
support for the latter ones is optional AND it is command specific: i.e.
ONLY some commands has an alternative async flavour.

In a nutshell a sync command transaction is made of 2 messages cmd/reply
across the same Agent_2_Platform bidirectional channel...
Instead if a command can be particularly 'heavy/slow' platform side to
satisfy, usually async support is present in the spec: in such case you
have a 3 message transaction:

1. A2P: cmd/reply ... where the reply ONLY carries the status OK

2. P2A: delayed_response ... a later asyncronous further reply that
carries the real content (e.g. a sensor reading that needed a lot of
time for the sensor itself to settle..)

The end result is that the A2P sync channel is NOT kept busy waiting for
the delayed reply...

Having said that, in the spec, while the sync commands are defined
across protocols with a monotonically increasing MSG_ID starting from 0
(with 0,1,2 IDs commonly defined across all protocols), the DELAYED_RESPONSE
are defined to have the same MSG_ID as the sync command for which they
constitues the async part ...

That is the reason we define them in such a way across all of the
existing 10 standard protocols...

In general of course I agree with this and try to keep the naming
exactly the same of the spec: in this case there are 2 reasons for the
deviation:

1. EVOLUTION - spec has evolved a lot and names have changed slightly between
   spec revisions AND I have NOT kept up with that...MY BAD...I will fix these
   occurencies

2. READABILITY - some naming is, IMHO, a bit silly/ill chosen in the
   spec because as an example if the implementation follows the spec
   naming pedantically, you would end up dealing with stuff like:

	de->de_id
	de->de_data_size

...so I killed some of this prefixes where from the context in the code and in
the spec SHOULD BE apparent what they represent...

Regarding some other cases like "grp_id" instead of "group_id"...I have NO excuses :D
... just me trying to keep statements short :P

Here is a mix of OLD spec, ill shortening of mine and silly naming I
would probably move this to:

	de->attributes_1

Ok...I was trying to avoid cumbersome NAMING while conveying the meaning
BUT I can certainly move to a more pedantic spec-compliant naming...

I suppose it is to meant that the optional DE name exist, while avoiding
to use a nomenclature that is too similar to Names and Extended Names as
they are used by all other protocols :D

Yes that would be my aim ...I will fix the needless shortening and align
the name to the last releases spec fiels while still deviating from the
spec ease readability by avoding stuff like de->de_id

Mmmm....right..I'll check...this was added to clear freed strcuture

This protocol_init function runs within an opened devm_group so that on
failure or when protocol is deinitialized by an unbound driver all is
cleaned up by the core SCMI stack through the devres group...a mechanism that
raised controversy already in the past :D but when all the core SCMI stack
and this mechanism was written there were NO cleanup.h magic available to
ease the development of SCMI protocols....

Anyway this initialization is triggered when one of the SCMI driver
using this protocol is bound and probes on its own...so the devres
machinery is anyway attached, albeit indirectly, to a probe path.

Having said that, in Telemetry I do use cleanup.h during intermediate
allocation and, once the allocation are finalized (no_free_ptr) I attach
a cleanup routine to the devres hooks...(routine which I now needs some
refinement on some err path...) that is the reason of the apparent lack
of freeing path

Thanks,
Cristian
