Hi Frederic,

Yes. In our database tests, suppressing the host's non-idle
periodic tick improved performance, with the rest of the host
configuration unchanged.

The tick policy itself can therefore affect guest performance.
A large host runs VMs for many customers with different workloads.
Customers create and release VMs independently, so the same host
CPU can be reassigned to a different workload while other VMs
remain running.

We want to choose whether to retain the non-idle tick or allow its
suppression for the workload currently assigned to each CPU, and
revisit that choice when the CPU is reassigned. Per-CPU control
lets us do this without rebooting or taking CPUs offline.

If a VM's vCPUs span housekeeping and nohz_full CPUs, some may
benefit from tick suppression while others cannot. For workloads
sensitive to tick interference, this can cause performance
differences within the VM. A common tick policy is one deployment
option in that case.

In summary, the runtime control would let us:

1. Select or withdraw tick suppression as CPUs are assigned to
   different workloads.
2. Apply a common non-idle tick policy across a VM's vCPUs when
   preferred.
