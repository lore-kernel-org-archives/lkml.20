Hi,

I'll chime in since I run nix and have a little bit of familiarity.

Looking at my (admittedly bloated) nix store.

[justin@zenbox ~]$ ls /nix/store | wc -l
259356

That's a lot of inodes. And a nix derivation creates hundreds if not
thousands potentially throughout it's build.

My main concern is that rulesets are generally considered
immutable after enforcement. This allows for well-defined semantics on
inheritence. This from my understanding would mutate the ruleset after
it's already enforced, so changes wouldn't be copied to inherited
domains automatically.

My other concern is with the overhead of automatically generating an inserting
a rule for every new inode that gets created. It seems like a complex
way to tackle this problem.

But beyond that, let's go back to your usecase.

....

Basically from what I'm seeing you want to grant some access to certain
subdirectories (including newly created ones) but exclude others.

Presumably in the nix case, you want to grant /nix/store/{abc,efg,hij} and NOT
/nix/store/{xyz}, but still allow /nix/store/{foo} (the derivation
output) to be created and written to. This would allow the nix build to only
have access to certain inputs, while being able to write to the /nix/store
and produce an output. This is a valid usecase that Landlock cannot today
accomplish.

There was this NO_INHERIT series I proposed a little while back.
[1] It's sort of the inverse of this (removes accesses inherited from
parents rather than granting new access) but would accomplish this
goal.

With NO_INHERIT, you could grant whatever access rights you want by default on
the parent directory, and place NO_INHERIT on any specific entries you
don't want to have inherit those rights. 

So for nix use case, you could grant no_inherit on everything except the
inputs you need, then add READ/WRITE/MKDIR etc on /nix/store. The new
directories would inherit this by default, while the ones you added
NO_INHERIT on would be restricted.

Additionally, you should also examine the mutable domains proposal by
Tingmao Wang, which could also facilitate this usecase as well [2] (i.e by
dynamically adding and removing rules with some fanotify/inotify glue).

That being said, neither of these two patchsets / proposals are merged,
and the playing field is still open on this.

So the problem you are pointing to is legitamate, but the solution still
needs to be considered carefully to avoid complexity.
