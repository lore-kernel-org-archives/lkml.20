:)  I see where the quote can be clearer.  FWIW the "driver process" was
referring to a userspace driver (which is a legitimate use of the D-word
with VFIO, but still).  I'll clarify that, and will indicate this
mechanism is used by userspace to influence the VFIO _exporter_ behaviour.

I don't follow here, sorry.  Would you please elaborate?

Currently VFIO uses the priv->revoked flag to track whether
it-the-exporter had previously done dma_buf_invalidate_mappings() on a
buffer and is now causing all .attach requests to fail.  Do you mean
that (even without this series) you want to call that concept
priv->reclaimed instead?

Or do you mean that you don't like the words "temporary"/"permanent" and
are looking for another name for a temporarily unavailable buffer?  (If
so, I find "not revoked", "reclaimed", "revoked" much less clear than
not/temp/perm revoked, as such names give no hint as to what to expect.
But I may have misunderstood what you're getting at.)

From the importer side, there is no change from this patch: they might
observe an invalidate_mappings() and find attach() of a given buffer now
fails, same as before this patch.  This is only about guaranteeing the
impossibility of an importer ever being able to re-attach in future.


Thanks,


Matt


PS:  A hypothetical alternative way of doing what this patch is doing is
instead to have:

 - existing priv->revoked
 - new 	    priv->revoked_flag_is_immutable

Then, the ioctl triggers an invalidate_mappings() for a targeted DMABUF,
sets revoked = true, and revoked_flag_is_immutable = true.  The new flag
prevents a future vfio_pci_dma_buf_move(false) from clearing revoked.
For example, a reset doing `move(true); reset; move(false);` can make
all DMABUFs available to attach again, except for those marked
immutably-revoked.  (That is equivalent to this new "permanent" state.)
