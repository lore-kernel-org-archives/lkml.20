In some paths maybe. I'd need to draw it out and it's Sunday evening
so not today! :)

No.  Writing back a line that was known to be be clean - neither CPU
nor devices ever wrote it.  The problem lies that it could have been
fetched in by a prefetcher at any random time. Then written back at
another random time - potentially on top of what ever DMA occurred
in the meantime.  It's completely broken but only if there is a way
to see it.  On that platform one was introduced much later than the
original design on basis everyone pretty much assumes cache coherency
protocols never do clean write backs.

Anyhow, tales that should be accompanied by strong spirits.  Not even
beer is enough for this one (and I was only on the side lines!)
