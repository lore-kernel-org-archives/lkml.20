Hi Jacob,

I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s worth doing the more complicated =
check either. Your v2 patch looks to be good enough given the available =
information. Perhaps there=E2=80=99s a way to do the residue read race =
free by involving additional features of the block incl. registers the =
driver currently ignores but until someone discovers it I support going =
with your patch.

Best regards,
Martin
