I suggest you also take at look at the review sashiko did for the V3
[1], as it contains some good suggestions (some of them are already
present in your list).

I did not test tiling as well - I think it's a mode limited to some
Intel cards?

A reserved memory region is (probably) a better idea, to allow change
the splash without recompiling the devicetree.

A possible usecase would be:

 - bootloader reads the BMP image from a dedicated partition and loads
   it to the reserved memory (very much like the BGRT path);
 - splash client parses the devicetree, finds the memory region and
   loads the image from there;
 - userspace updates the dedicated partition with a different image.

Yes, please, either as a co-maintainer or as a reviewer, as you see fit.

Thank you for continuing the effort on this - I still believe it's
useful, but currently is not fitting inside my schedule.
