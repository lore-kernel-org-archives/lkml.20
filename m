Subject: [PATCH v4 08/18] perf trace: Handle fork and exit directly in BPF

Updating target or filtered PIDs in userspace upon processing
PERF_RECORD_FORK and PERF_RECORD_EXIT events introduces latency between
event occurrence and userspace BPF map updates. If a newly forked child
executes system calls before userspace processes PERF_RECORD_FORK, those
syscalls may be dropped by BPF PID filtering. Conversely, if userspace
evicts PIDs asynchronously on PERF_RECORD_EXIT, the kernel may recycle a
PID before userspace processes the exit event, causing the late eviction
to silently drop a newly created task that received the recycled PID.

Address this by attaching BTF-typed raw tracepoint BPF programs directly
to the scheduler task lifetime tracepoints:

1. Attach SEC("tp_btf/sched_process_fork") (sched_process_fork), which
   runs in copy_process() in the parent's context before
   wake_up_new_task() wakes the child. Using tp_btf rather than
   SEC("tp/sched/sched_process_fork") receives the stable TP_PROTO
   arguments (struct task_struct *parent, struct task_struct *child)
   rather than the tracepoint ring-buffer record (TP_STRUCT__entry),
   whose layout changed in Linux 6.16 when parent_comm and child_comm
   were converted from 16-byte arrays to 4-byte __data_loc strings.
   When inherit is enabled and the pid of the thread that called
   clone() is in pids_to_trace or pids_filtered, insert child->pid into
   the corresponding map immediately. Because child->pid is task_struct.pid
   (the global initial-namespace PID), this works accurately across PID
   namespaces without aliasing host PIDs, and covers both new processes
   and CLONE_THREAD threads without needing real_parent CO-RE walks or
   syscall-return heuristics.
2. Attach SEC("tp_btf/sched_process_exit") (sched_process_exit), which
   runs in do_exit() for every task in its own context, including tasks
   killed by signals (SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, etc.) and secondary threads torn
   down implicitly by exit_group. Delete the dying task's PID from
   pids_to_trace and pids_filtered immediately in kernel space,
   eliminating both map leaks and any asynchronous userspace eviction
   window where PID recycling could occur.
3. Attach SEC("tp_btf/sched_process_exec") (sched_process_exec) to
   follow the one case where a live task's pid changes underneath the
   maps. When a thread that is not the group leader execs, de_thread()
   kills the leader and hands the leader's pid, which is the tgid, to
   the exec'ing thread. The leader dies first, so sched_process_exit()
   has already dropped exactly the pid the survivor now holds, and the
   survivor's old entry would be stranded in the map for good. Move the
   entry from old_pid to p->pid. old_pid is sampled in bprm_execve()
   before de_thread() runs, so the ordinary group leader exec is a
   no-op here. Drop the old key before inserting the new one:
   the move is only a rename, but holding both keys at once needs a
   spare slot, and on a full map the insert would fail with -E2BIG
   while the delete still succeeded, losing the task instead of
   moving it.
4. With every live task registered before its first syscall and evicted
   in do_exit(), simplify pid_to_trace__has() and pid_filter__has() to
   single BPF hash map lookups, and move bpf_probe_read_kernel() in
   sys_exit back after the PID filter checks.
5. Pass the inherit flag from userspace to BPF .rodata via
   augmented_syscalls__prepare(!trace.opts.no_inherit), and split
   attaching out of it into augmented_syscalls__attach(), called from
   trace__run() once the pid, syscall and program array maps have all
   been programmed. These are system wide programs, so from the instant
   they attach they alone decide what is traced: attaching at load time,
   as before, left a window in which a target could fork without
   sched_process_fork() knowing the parent was a target, and with the
   userspace fork handling gone there was nothing left to recover it.
   The scheduler programs are attached ahead of sys_enter and sys_exit
   for the same reason. Set has_pids_filtered only after populating
   pids_filtered. A failure to attach ends the session, reporting the
   error that caused it. There is no falling back to unaugmented
   tracing by that point: cmd_trace() built the evlist around
   __augmented_syscalls__ and dropped the sys_enter evsel, so a session
   that carried on would report nothing at all. Neither did the code
   this replaces, which ignored the result of
   augmented_raw_syscalls_bpf__attach() altogether and ran on with
   programs that had never been attached.
6. Remove the userspace BPF map updates from PERF_RECORD_FORK and
   PERF_RECORD_EXIT in trace__process_event(), and delete the now-unused
   augmented_syscalls__{add,del,has}_target_pid() helpers. No coverage
   is lost with them: those records only come into being once the ring
   buffers are mapped by evlist__do_mmap() and the events are switched
   on by evlist__enable(), both of which run after
   augmented_syscalls__attach() in trace__run(), and they are then acted
   on later still, whenever the poll loop gets round to them. The
   scheduler programs therefore go live strictly earlier than the
   userspace path could ever have reacted.
7. Gate pid_filter__has() on a has_pids_filtered flag in .bss so the
   common case without --filter-pids performs no map lookups, and size
   pids_to_trace and pids_filtered at 16384 entries. pids_filtered is
   grown from 64 because it is no longer just the handful of pids
   userspace names: sched_process_fork() adds every descendant of those,
   so a --filter-pids target that forks or is heavily threaded needs the
   same headroom as a traced one.

A fork or exit is still not seen if it happens before the programs are
attached, that is between evlist__create_maps() scanning /proc for a -p
target and augmented_syscalls__attach(). Such a window is inherent in
programming a system wide filter before switching it on, and as above
the userspace handling did not cover it either. The cost is not small
though. Once the bpf-output event exists cmd_trace() removes the
sys_enter evsel from the evlist, so __augmented_syscalls__ is the only
source of enter events and a pid that is missing from pids_to_trace is
not reported at all. sys_enter returning 1 keeps the kernel tracepoint
alive for other subscribers, it does not give perf trace a second path
to the event. A target that forks during perf trace's own startup can
therefore have that child, and in turn everything the child forks, go
untraced for the whole run.

The tgid fallback that pid_to_trace__has() used to have would have
masked part of this, since a thread missed in the window still shares
the tgid of a target userspace did insert. It is not kept because it
would also re-admit tasks that sched_process_fork() deliberately
skipped: under --no-inherit a new thread of the target is not added to
the map, yet it shares the target's tgid and a tgid test cannot tell it
apart from one that was.

sched_process_fork() does not consult the parent's tgid either, for the
same reason. Every thread of a -p target is enumerated from
/proc/<pid>/task and inserted under its own pid, and -t names a single
thread, so a tgid test adds no reach. What it would add is a child
inheriting from a thread that is not traced itself: a sibling of the
thread -t selected, or one missed in the attach window whose own
syscalls go unreported. Inheritance keys off the pid of the thread that
called clone(), exactly as the lookups do.

Two of the three ways of selecting what to trace are unaffected:
'perf trace -- cmd' cannot hit this because evlist__prepare_workload()
leaves the child blocked on a pipe until evlist__start_workload(), well
after the attach, and 'perf trace -a' never sets has_pids_to_trace so
it does not filter at all. It is 'perf trace -p' against an already
running target that is exposed. Closing that too needs the descendants
of the target re-enumerated from /proc after the attach, which the next
change does.
