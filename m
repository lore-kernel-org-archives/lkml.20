Makes sense. However, if follow your suggestion to change the setter to
fix the setter/checker mismatch, 9a6694cfa239 remains the appropriate
Fixes tag, since it introduced that mismatch; and it is a feasible
point for back port.

My concern was whether an inherited event and its parent could trace
concurrently on different CPUs.

Normal inherited AUX recording uses CPU restricted events (cpu != -1),
children inherit the parent event’s CPU restriction, a particular parent
event and its children cannot trace concurrently on different CPUs.

Since inherit with cpu == -1 prevents buffer mapping [1], my concern for
this case is also not valid.

I will update the patch to update setter. Thanks for suggestion.
