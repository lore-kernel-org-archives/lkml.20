Userspace schedulers use this to decide whether to submit a task to
the hardware accelerator or fall back to CPU computation.  When a
process initializes, it reads the device usage and compares it
against a threshold: if the accelerator is busy, the process uses
CPU computation for its lifetime; if it's idle, the process
submits tasks to the accelerator.  This needs a stable,
programmatically readable interface.

The per-algorithm detail is necessary because a device may have
independent engines -- e.g. the HiSilicon ZIP device has separate
compression and decompression engines, and a process doing
compression should only check the compression usage, not the
decompression usage.  Aggregating them into one value would cause
wrong scheduling decisions.

To follow the one-value-per-file rule, I propose exposing one sysfs
file per algorithm, with the algorithm name in the filename:

     /sys/class/uacce/<dev>/dev_usage_compress
     /sys/class/uacce/<dev>/dev_usage_decompress

Each file contains a single integer (0-100) formatted with
sysfs_emit().  The filenames are driver-defined based on the
algorithms the device supports, but every dev_usage_* file always
returns the same type -- a single usage percentage.  Userspace
discovers the available files by listing the device directory.

Is this approach acceptable?
