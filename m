Hi Anup,

Thanks for the follow-up. I may be missing something, so I wanted to 
double-check this against the guest TLB shootdown path.

If I follow the Linux guest CoW path correctly, when the mapping is 
updated in step#2 it goes through:

   wp_page_copy()
     -> ptep_clear_flush()
       -> flush_tlb_page()
         -> __flush_tlb_range(mm, mm_cpumask(mm), ...)

So the remote SFENCE.VMA appears to be targeted only at CPUs in 
mm_cpumask(mm), rather than at all VCPUs of the guest. mm_cpumask is 
updated in switch_mm()/set_mm() for guest CPUs that have actually run 
that mm.

In our case, before the CoW the process had only ever run on vcpu0. From 
the guest's point of view it did not migrate: the host migration of 
vcpu0 from cpu1 to cpu0 is not visible to guest Linux, which only sees 
vCPUs. So at CoW time mm_cpumask still contains only vcpu0 (or at least 
does not contain vcpu1), and __flush_tlb_range() would not IPI vcpu1. 
The local SFENCE on vcpu0 would only cover host cpu0, where vcpu0 is 
currently running. The stale VS-stage TLB entry left on host cpu1 from 
when vcpu0 previously ran there would then remain.

Later, still without any further vCPU migration, the process is 
scheduled inside the guest onto vcpu1, which remains on host cpu1, and 
can hit that stale entry.

This also seems more likely when the ASID allocator is enabled, because
set_mm_asid() does not always local_flush_tlb_all() on switch_mm(). So 
even the first time the process lands on vcpu1, a stale ASID-tagged 
entry on host cpu1 may still be present.

In other words, I am not sure this case is covered by a full guest TLB 
flush to all VCPUs on the mapping update. Guest shootdown looks 
mm_cpumask-based, and host pCPU migration of a vCPU does not by itself 
add other vCPUs that never ran the mm into that mask.

The earlier RFC note has a bit more detail on the flow we observed:
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/0d15b098-b8f7-4080-9f33-e8c49c2331e1@bosc.ac.cn/

Please let me know if I misunderstood the intended invalidation path here.

Thanks,
Yaxing
