Tom gave you a R-by on v12 before I asked you to axe off a bunch of stuff=
 from
that patch. Dave gave you a R-by to this revision which is still under
discussion and you wanna keep it regardless.

There's a R-by Ackerley which you carry at least since v5:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/6f1ec3d8ebcf3aaceccc099c07d0deb545dd4ab9.177913=
3590.git.ashish.kalra@amd.com

to which Ackerley is STILL GIVING YOU review feedback ON THAT SAME THREAD=
:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAEvNRgGfyb7zvZ1u1j7YLomD%2BJdAxnVW36gtvNG9gxgZ=
80vMyQ@mail.gmail.com

and yet you're still debating.

From where I'm standing, it looks like you don't understand how those tag=
s
should be used.

Do you need to go refresh up on the docs:

"Both Tested-by and Reviewed-by tags, once received on mailing list from =
tester
or reviewer, should be added by author to the applicable patches when sen=
ding
next versions.  However if the patch has changed substantially in followi=
ng
version, these tags might not be applicable anymore and thus should be re=
moved.
Usually removal of someone's Acked-by, Tested-by or Reviewed-by tags shou=
ld be
mentioned in the patch changelog with an explanation (after the '---'
separator)."

?

You're using Suggested-by tags also willy-nilly:

"A Suggested-by: tag indicates that the patch idea is suggested by the pe=
rson
named and ensures credit to the person for the idea: if we diligently cre=
dit
our idea reporters, they will, hopefully, be inspired to help us again in=
 the
future. Note, this is one of only three tags you might be able to use wit=
hout
explicit permission of the person named (see 'Tagging people requires
permission' below for details)."

So all 4 people have suggested this patch?

No, ofc not. You have simply received review comments from them which you=
've
decided to integrate into your patch. This doesn't need a Suggested-by ta=
g.
This is normal patch review process. You should try it sometimes.

And this is damn well documented but you're still debating.

Well, you can debate all you want - those patches are not going anywhere =
until
you do them right. This is solely your call.

Yes, you basically do the *minimal* work that is absolutely necessary and
leave everything else untouched because it is unnecessary complication to=
 all
the code and if one is going to toggle SNP and hotplug, then one has bigg=
er
problems than some leftover facilities.

You can't:

system_unbound_wq =3D alloc_workqueue("events_unbound", WQ_UNBOUND | __WQ=
_DEPRECATED, WQ_MAX_ACTIVE);
								   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	__WQ_DEPRECATED         =3D 1 << 19, /* internal: workqueue is deprecate=
d */

So if you do an unbound workqueue and then block migration around it, you=
're
basically doing a WQ_PERCPU one. So why don't you do one of those and dro=
p the
migration toggles around it?

All this talking is to get you to get the hint that *whatever* you do, it
needs to have a good comment above it explaining why it has been chosen t=
his
way. Or put that info in the commit message.

So that people who look at that code in the future, can change it after
knowing why.

And you should not do excessive commenting - it suffices if you put a cou=
ple
of key comments which explain non-trivial things only. The rest people ca=
n
figure out by simply reading the code.
