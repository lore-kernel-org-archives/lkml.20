Driver state that an open file can reach, such as a struct cdev,
video_device or miscdevice embedded in it, must not be devm memory: the
file outlives the unbind, and the next operation on it, typically close(),
is a use-after-free. This keeps being fixed one driver at a time: commit
44f3468a0aef ("gpio: sloppy-logic-analyzer: fix use-after-free via debugfs
trigger on unbind") this summer, a debugfs write racing unbind on devm
private data; commit 7d6358ab0286 ("media: cx231xx: fix devres lifetime")
in March, one of a sweep of the related wrong-device lifetime. In 7.4-rc1
cx231xx still has the shape: its state, with four video_devices and its
mutex embedded, is devm_kzalloc()'d against the USB interface, and
disconnect defers release to close() while devres frees the state at
unbind; a fix is under review ("[PATCH 0/6] media: cx231xx: make USB
disconnect teardown safe", Nick Faro, linux-media, 2026-08-27, changes
requested). xilinx_hwicap embeds its struct cdev in devm memory the same
way.

This series adds CONFIG_DEBUG_DEVRES_REFS, a runtime debug check rather
than a static rule. From device_unbind_cleanup(), before
devres_release_all(), it snapshots the device's managed allocations, walks
every task's fd table once, and WARNs when an open file still points into
an allocation about to be freed, through file->private_data, the inode's
i_private, the inode's cdev for a character device, or an object a
subsystem names through a small hook. Such a pointer dangles once release
runs; it is a use-after-free if anything dereferences it afterwards, which
for private_data is any operation, for a cdev its release on close, and
for a debugfs file a new open or an unguarded release. A hit on a live
debugfs file is decided after release instead, because many drivers remove
their debugfs files through a devres action; debugfs_file_revoked() and
debugfs_file_release_safe() (patch 1, inert until patch 2 adds the Kconfig
symbol) tell the check whether debugfs has cut the file off and whether
its release can still reach the data.

The walks run on a kernel thread the unbinding task waits for, and no file
reference is kept across release. A reference the walk holds becomes the
last one if the owner closes the file meanwhile; dropped from a user task
its release would be queued behind unbind, where a devres action that
waits for the close (snd_card_free()) deadlocks; dropped from a kernel
thread it goes to the delayed-fput work. What remains, and I would like
your view on it (question 5): that work drains one global list
last-in-first-out with all its runs serialized, so a release there that
needs a lock unbind holds (a usbfs close takes the USB parent lock a USB
interface unbind holds) stalls every later delayed close, including one
such an action is waiting for; without this option that close would have
run from its owner's task work. The cross-vendor review this went through
found the first of these.

Subsystems whose files do not reach the driver object through those
pointers register the hook, keyed on their file_operations; V4L2 is the
first (patch 3), naming the video_device; its drvdata is not named, since
reaching it means dereferencing a video_device that may already be freed.
The hook is a workaround. The cdev route catches a struct cdev embedded in
managed memory (an open file pins the cdev's kobject, so inode->i_cdev is
still there at unbind) but not these: V4L2's cdev is a separate
cdev_alloc() with no kobject parent, and misc's is one shared cdev, so
neither leads to the driver's allocation. Parenting V4L2's cdev to the
video device, as mc-devnode and cec do with cdev_device_add(), would make
the cdev hold the device whose release deletes the cdev; that is a
media-core change with regression risk, not something a debug option
should carry. A DRM hook is deferred: devm_drm_dev_alloc() memory is
kzalloc()'d, so the expected yield is low.

Testing, one boot of an x86 KVM guest with KASAN, on the development
branch (identical to this series except for two extra test vehicles): the
test driver in patch 4 (a devm-backed misc node, a devm-embedded cdev
node, a refcounted control node and a devres-removed debugfs file) and a
cx231xx-shaped V4L2 vehicle WARN once per dangling allocation before the
unbind returns (two for the test driver, one for the V4L2 vehicle), after
which KASAN reports use-after-frees on close of the misc and cdev nodes
and, for the V4L2 vehicle, 38 reports across a read, an ioctl and close;
the gpio sloppy logic analyzer, instantiated through a fake-gpiochip glue
module and unbound with four debugfs files held open, produces four info
lines and no WARN, its reads return -EIO and nothing fires on close;
vivid, as a negative control, is silent. The V4L2 vehicle and the glue are
in the branch below, not in the series. Also compiled: the option off;
DEBUG_FS=3Dn; VIDEO_DEV=3Dm with DEVM_REFS_TEST=3Dm (videodev.ko and the te=
st
module through modpost); W=3D1 clean on devres.o, dd.o, v4l2-dev.o,
debugfs/file.o and the test driver. Only the all-builtin configuration was
booted. Not exercised: the two phase-2 WARN branches (a removed but
unguarded, or a still-live, debugfs file) and the no-memory fallback.

Limitations, also in the Kconfig help: only files in task fd tables are
seen; the check finds pointers that are dangling at that moment, not
teardown races, nor whether a debugfs removal action ran before or after
the free; a managed allocation whose release waits for its files to close
first (an ALSA card) is not about to be freed, so a hit on it is a false
positive; and the walk is linear in threads times fd tables and costs
every unbind and failed probe (not deferral).

Questions for review:
 1. Is driver core the right home for this, or should it be
    per-subsystem (misc, V4L2) with no generic walk?
 2. Is a hook keyed on file_operations acceptable, or should the
    answer for V4L2 be the cdev_device_add() conversion despite its
    risk?
 3. Is the info/WARN split for removed-and-guarded versus unguarded
    debugfs files the right call?
 4. Should the test be a module plus a tools/testing/selftests script
    rather than a module alone? The check needs fds held in a task fd
    table across the unbind, which KUnit cannot do naturally.
 5. The walk must hold a reference on each file it inspects, so a
    racing close can make it the last holder; routing that release
    through the delayed-fput worker avoids the task-work deadlock but
    leaves the serialized-worker case above. Is that acceptable for a
    debug option, or is there a way to look at a file's pointers
    without the walk ever owning the last reference?

Per Documentation/process/generated-content.rst: the code, the test
vehicles and the first drafts of these messages were written with Claude
(Anthropic) under my direction, from prompts that specified the mechanism,
the call site, the lock context and the debugfs handling; the series was
then revised through repeated model-assisted review passes against the
kernel source, including one by reviewers from three other model families,
with the fixes mine to judge. I have read and can answer for every line.
Where I most expect to be wrong is in the Kconfig's list of limitations
and in the choice to put the hook in driver core at all.

linux-media is Cc'd on the whole series because the hook API exists
for V4L2; linux-doc on patch 2 for devres.rst.
