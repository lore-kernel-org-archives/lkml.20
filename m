A question that is more 'interesting' than it would initially seem.
Normally I'd agree with Marcelo that we should be as user friendly as
possible, but there is a problem..

Given how well behaved and discoverable these parts are, the driver will
work fine for new parts that we don't know about (which is sadly rather
unusual!)  That is why we can just use a single compatible.
If we were to use the right name and saw an unknown part, what would call
it?  spd31 or something odd like spd31-compat.  Then we would want to
add the new part name but run into a problem. Doing so would be potential
ABI breakage if anyone happened to be matching on spd31-compat :(

So let's go the easy way and just call them all spd31 as you have it today.

Good question though.  My first reply that I typed out was to what Marcelo
was suggesting then I changed my mind!
