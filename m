This patch as-is is just way way way WAY too complicated and fragile IMO.

Whatever cases you have found, they need to be fixed somewhere
fundamental. All of this feels like a hack.

If you're having to write a comment like:

/*
 * If X is Y, but not if B, and if Z is J but not if the moon's bright at
 * night, then maybe we will foo the bar, but only if the baz is blarghed,
 * ...
 */

That usually means you're doing something horribly wrong.

And this patch has multiple comments like that.
