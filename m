Hi Sean,

Frank tested your suggested change on Zhaoxin systems **without** PDCM,
using kvm_intel. The results support the fix.

MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES is no longer listed in
KVM_GET_MSR_FEATURE_INDEX_LIST. A direct KVM_GET_MSRS query on the
/dev/kvm fd still succeeds, with the MSR data changing from 0x2000
to 0 through the existing unsupported-MSR handling. The MSR remains
in KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST, and the existing vCPU userspace behavior
of allowing reads of zero and writes of zero is unchanged.

We also checked the QEMU behavior. With the MSR absent from the feature
list, QEMU's supported-feature query returns zero for PERF_CAPABILITIES.
The PDCM bit in KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID is unchanged and was already
clear on these systems. QEMU filters PDCM out of CPU models that request
it, so this resolves our concern about the effect on CPU model selection.

feature_msrs_test passes with the change. vmx_pmu_caps_test is skipped
on these systems, and the other KVM selftests we ran showed no regressions.
Our hardware testing covered systems without PDCM; we have not validated
the change on PDCM-capable hardware.

One observation about the ARCH_CAPABILITIES check: in the code we
checked, EMULATED_F(ARCH_CAPABILITIES) already enables the capability
unconditionally, so the new check does not change its behavior.

Thanks,
Ewan
