You misunderstood me, I said young people. I asked multiple young=20
programmers=20who were interested in linux why aren't they contributing
to the linux kernel and they said that it was hard for them to learn=20
because=20many issues they find in staging(which I believe you recently=

As far as I know it is decently used piece of hardware so it should
have users.

Possibility,=20however it would require someone with sufficient knowledge
to tweek it, which who knows if it is as simple as readme says. And I
didn't mean it as a upstream ready driver, but rather a place where
new people can learn as I previously said.
