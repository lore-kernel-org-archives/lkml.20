Yes, of course it does. The DMA API only works on phy_addr_t. If you
have a struct p2pdma_provider * then you have a phys_addr_t for it.

If the exporter knows it is working with a MMIO mapping on a PCI
device it gets to acquire a p2pdma_provider and use the helper.

None of this is suposed to solve your "resources the CPU cannot reach"
problem, that has nothing to do with DMA API or P2P. It is not broken
just because it doesn't solve every problem.

Hellwig's point was that the subsystem needs a mapping helper that
goes from the subsystem address representation to the HW
representation and hides these details from the drivers.

Look at what he built in nvme around biovec.

The dma_buf_phys_vec_to_sgt() is the dmabuf version of the same idea,
the subystem provides the mapping helper. We can try to do better, but
better is not making the exporters touch the mapping algorithm.

Ultimately I want to see something in lib/ handle this with a
non-scatterlist datastructure, but there is a huge gulf between where
dmabuf is now and it being able to work with a non-scatterlist
datastructure.

Look, it is easy to complain you don't like how it looks, but this
stuff is hard there are lots of competing concerns, if you have a
better idea now is a good time to present it. Maybe if you look
closely you will appreciate how much work has gone into even getting
things this far.

I don't know how to respond to that. It is spec complaint, it is
shipping in enormous volumes, of course Linux needs to support the HW
that exists.

Yep. Very few devices in the world can use ATS for every single
operation. Many have this split operating model. Some even only use
ATS for DMA flows that are faultable.

Mostly the OS can't tell what the device is doing and doesn't
care. The P2P routing is the main issue and we have hacked around it
in our systems till now. Leon is trying to fix it. Thomas needs it
fixed too for Xe. So what's the issue here?

DMABUF needs to learn how to do interconnect specific behaviors. PCI
is an interconnect, it has lots and lots of crazy rules. An
importer/exporter that chooses to use PCI for their DMA should have a
way to exchange PCI specific information.

So should UALink and all the other zoo of options we have now. It
cannot be completely generic and meet everyones needs.

Can we focus on that instead of arguing if the PCI craziness should
exist or not?

Spec doesn't say anything about when a device has to translated vs
untranslated. The ATS flags only say translated is allowed to be used.

ATS is for alot more than that, and there is no abuse here.
