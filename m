I don't think it invalidates the concept you're going for, but this
description is a bit misleading without some historical context.  In
particular this is a bit confused by the fact that there are both
source-level (dts) overlays and binary-level (dtb) overlays.

Source overlays came first, in conjuction with /include/ support in
dtc, and were intended for use case (2) and similar.  A group of
boards with the same SoC was the most common case, but families of
similar boards and families of similar SoCs also used this mechanism.
At the time this was still envisaging that a complete tree was built
at boot time, and didn't change.

This started to drift into use case (1) since without hotplug (we'll
get to that), a board with different hats (or whatever) can be
considered variants of the same base board.

That still required the complete tree be built at compile time (or at
least bootloader / kernel installation time).  That wasn't great for
two reasons, roughly matching your two use cases:

 1. Compile time is obviously no good for hotplugged hats.  Even for
    coldplug hats, it's desirable to be able to complete the tree at
    boot time rather than compile / deploy time.

 2. Bootloaders often want to support a variety of related boards, not
    just a single configuration.  That was already possible by
    incorporating a full dtb for every variant, but it gets pretty
    bulky and bootloaders are often pretty constrained.

dtb overlays were invented to address these, though I don't know that
difference between the two motivations was particularly well
understood at the time.

dtb overlays were pretty much a direct transcription of dts overlay
semantics to dtb and runtime.  The use of "in band" encoding (special
properties) is kind of inelegant, but it worked well enough to become
popular.

This works reasonably well for use case (2).  That makes sense: the
semantics are based on dts overlays which were designed for use case
(2).

But, dtb overlays have always been a nasty hack for case (1), even
though that's become the predominant one.  Overlays can change
anywhere in the tree, whether or not that's physically sensible via
the hat connector (or whatever).  The semantics of applying an overlay
lose information (by design), which means that removing an overlay for
hot unplug is a complete mess.  The way we encode the information
necessary to apply an overlay is kind of messy and inconsistent.

Still, they worked well enough for (1) that they've become widespread.
Herv=E9 Condina is now working on a new scheme (dubbed "addons") which
is actually designed for case (1), and should suit it much better.
It's a fair way off being ready for use, but it's a good development.

I like this idea.  It separates the case where the impetus is just to
save binary size from the case where there's a logical separation
between the pieces.  It decouples the generation of dtb overlays from
their expression as dts overlays (where you want a logical separation
for human readability).

Nice.  I suspect this gap would be substantially smaller with a large
window compressor.  The trick here is that the factoring is finding
long distance redundancies which lz4 won't be able to see.

Thanks for that clear and helpful context.  My views on AI are
complicated, leaning negative, but I do think it can be a useful tool
and have no plans to reject patches purely because they're AI
assisted.  A statement like that goes a long way to convincing me that
I'm not about to waste my effort reviewing slop.  c.f. my rather
unfriendly response[2] to a recent very sloppish bug report which
vastly overestimated the impact of the bugs in question.

uss/

Understand that all dtc maintainership is unpaid volunteer time for
me, so I'm less responsive about reviews than would be ideal.  I am
gradually chiping away at the backlog, though.
