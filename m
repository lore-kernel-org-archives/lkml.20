We really need to move forward with this.

Are there any concerns other than backward compatibility?

As Andre already pointed out, there are no other notable projects
implementing the old, incorrect binding.

Out of tree users such as Armbian are likely cherry-picking WIP patches
from Jernej's tree or the mailing list, even the current stuff like this
patch[1], and they can and will continue to do so until the stuff is merged=
.
