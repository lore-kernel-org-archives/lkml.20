Yeah, forgot about that. Ideally, we should get the ioctl(SG_IO) to return
-EINVAL for an invalid data direction but that indeed requires parsing the
commands, which we do *not* want to do.

Yep, these are the only ones we can catch easily. Other commands we do not look
at/know about will keep potentially triggering iommu page faults, but that is
fine as that is not a crash. However, ideally, that should lead to the command
being failed, which it seems we are unable to do... Did you check if we can
propagate the fault into a the request to indicate a failure?

Not sure if that one is ideal either. Let me check and get back to you next week.
