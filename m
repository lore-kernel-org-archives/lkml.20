o OGC unstable prior to v1 where Denis reviewed and tagged it prior to it b=
eing submitted. I wasn't Cc'd or informed that it was already on a v2 less =
than 48h later, so I submitted my feedback directly on the PR a couple days=
 later. Had I been aware I would have obviously submitted feedback here.

If Denis reviewed it prior to V1 this is ok. It still does not explain
why you reviewed the PR after V1. I checked. Both V1 and V2 were
posted on Aug 24. Your feedback was on the 28th

What you did is a disservice to Matias and to us. Matias wants to see
his device work under Bazzite. You set the arbitrary requirement of
kernel drivers being needed for hid writes and that those drivers
_need_ to be on the mailing list before you merge them. So, his device
broke in a recent update. Then, Matias spends his personal time to
develop such a kernel driver and posts it to the mailing list.

Instead of getting thorough reviews here and support to show this
driver has traction, you conduct your review on a misc repo after
getting your arbitrary ML requirement met. This is a disservice to
Matias. And we see a driver without any traction and conduct
duplicative reviews. This is a disservice to us.

Explain how you will avoid this situation in the future
