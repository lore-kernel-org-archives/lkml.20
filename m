One name just crosses my mind. How about TDX_CFG_INDEP_F()? where INDEP stands
for independent.

- TDX_CFG_F() for features that are dependent on kvm_cpu_caps[]
- TDX_CFG_INDEP_F() for features not dependent on kvm_cpu_caps[]

1. why add comments for them? Because implementation wise, they are possible to
be supported by KVM but just current KVM doesn't have code to support them yet?

If so, are the others the features that are concluded to be impossible to be
supported by KVM?

2. We don't need to talk about FRED, which is even not suppported for normal VMs
yet. Unless we are trying to enable FRED for TDs specifically.

why not split into two category? Because they are overlapped?

  - Features forced to zero when #VE is reduced
  - Features lack KVM support

As for "features forced to zero when #VE is reduced", do you mean when TDX
module supports "#VE reduction" feature, the features becomes fixed0? or when
guest enables "reduce #VE", the guest see a 0 value even though the feature is
still configurable to host userspace and host userspace configure it to 1?

What is CID?
and Is PBE related to any bit of IA32_MISC_ENABLE? Did you mean PEBS instead?

I don't understand what this category. It talks about something when
TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE is set, which depends on guest TD's behavior. So what if
the guest TD doesn't set TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE?

PREFETCHWT1 (if the name is correct) is not supported by the kernel right? For
such unknown features, it's straightforward to not support it.

AMX-TRANSPOSE has been turned into reserved, and kernel never supports it. I
think we don't need to mention it at all.

RAO_INT is fixed 0 for TDX 1.5?

At last, I think we can just classify all of the above as 3 types:

- Features that are directly configurable by TDX and in kvm_cpu_caps[].
  use TDX_CFG_F()

- Features that are directly configurable by TDX and KVM actually supports them
  or KVM can support them but not in kvm_cpu_caps[]. Use TDX_CFG_EXTRA_F().
  For example, MWAIT, XTPR, and HT.

- Features that are directly configurable by TDX but KVM or kenrel doesn't
  support them.
  For example, RDT_A, RDT_M, PREFETCHWT1, PSN,
