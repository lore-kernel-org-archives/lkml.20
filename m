I originally pushed back on hard-coding a fixed frequency for these 
timers because if the bootloader changed the frequency of the clocks for 
these timers, we may run in to a problem. But I don't think the 
bootloader had changed the clock frequency in a long time, so it may not 
really be a problem. But it just feels wrong to not take in a frequency 
from the clock driver.

The other option is perhaps adding the ability to defer probe these timers?

Thanks,
Dinh
