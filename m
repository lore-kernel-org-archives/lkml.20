There are multiple series, and this is the final one:

1. arm-cca-guest series
2. arm-cca-host IDE setup series
3. iommufd interface for TSM operations
4. arm-cca-host TDISP support (this series)

We ended up with a viommu despite having no stage-1 SMMU or vSMMU
because it held the KVM reference needed by item (3) above [1]. With the
recent changes in that series [2], we now inherit the KVM details from
VFIO through iommufd_device_bind. I can possibly look at using the idev
for this instead.

We do not have a separate vdev-create operation; instead, we have
tsm_bind. The required iommufd objects (idev/viommu) are set up before
tsm_bind.

Currently, the primary reason for having a viommu is to obtain the KVM
reference. Now that the KVM details are inherited from VFIO through
iommufd_device_bind(), I can look at using the idev instead and dropping
the viommu requirement.

I designed this so that the PSMMU details are managed by the arm-smmu
driver, with minimal involvement from arm-cca-host. If the arm-smmu
driver does not set up the PSMMU correctly, tsm_bind, which is handled
by arm-cca-host, can fail.
