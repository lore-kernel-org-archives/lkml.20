Maybe, but I understand how the kernel, PCI, and P2P DMA work, and dma-buf
seems to operate in a parallel reality that is not aligned with any of them.

Let's discuss the PCI P2P case, where `p2pdma_provider` is present. In this
flow, the exporter has a PCI device, and the importer also has one when it
attaches. The decision about how to construct the addresses is made at that
point. Note that both the exporter and importer are PCI P2P devices, so the
importer should make the request.

How is it possible for exporter with p2pdma_provider?

But we are talking about in-tree exporters: RDMA, VFIO e.t.c

They need an access to p2pdma_provider too.
