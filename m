Thanks. I agree that a single DWord write would avoid the RMW need but I
don't think we can safely infer that bits 31:2 are reserved.

Section 5.2.3.2 defines Register Bit Width as the size of the given
register, while Access Size only specifies the transaction size.
With Bit Width 2, Table 8.26 designates reserved bits only within that
described register, it does not make the remaining bits of the 32-bit
access unit part of Performance Limited. Those bits could contain
unrelated state which must (generally) be preserved.

The full-width case is different: Bit Width 32 makes bits 31:2 part of the
Performance Limited register, so Table 8.26 identifies them as reserved and
Section 4.6.1 permits writing zero.

Therefore I think the generic driver must keep a 2-bit/DWord descriptor
readable but not clearable. If this platform guarantees that bits 31:2
have no side effects, firmware should just describe the register with
Bit Width 32? Then the current code would clear it using one DWord write.

Does that make sense? Did I miss anything?

Good to hear and thanks for testing!
(That being said, I'll drop your tags for v5 unfortunately as I have changes
in the middle of the series :/ )
