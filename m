Subject: [PATCH v4 12/21] perf test attr: Accept either sample id bit perf asks for

From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

evlist__config() asks for a way to tell the samples apart,
PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER where available, PERF_SAMPLE_ID otherwise:

  bool sample_id = opts->sample_id;
  ...
  if (opts->full_auxtrace || opts->sample_identifier) {
        ...
        use_sample_identifier = perf_can_sample_identifier();
        sample_id = true;
  } else if (evlist__nr_entries(evlist) > 1) {
        ...
        use_sample_identifier = perf_can_sample_identifier();
        sample_id = true;
  }

so the id is asked for whenever the evlist has more than one event, and
also when asked to outright, with --sample-identifier or by an auxtrace
session, or by record__config() for a pipe run, through opts->sample_id,
none of which depends on the sample types: 'perf record
--sample-identifier -e cycles' and the arm SPE expectations in this very
directory ask for it with a single event.

Which one it asks for depends on the composition of the evlist: with
more than one core PMU a request for 'cycles' becomes one event per core
PMU, the extra dummy tracking events then make the sample types differ and
perf goes for IDENTIFIER, while the expectations were written on machines
with a single core PMU, where perf asks for ID:

  expected sample_type=263, got 65799    # 263 | (1 << 16)
  expected sample_type=343, got 65815    # (343 & ~(1 << 6)) | (1 << 16), group-sampling

Both bits mean the same thing here, how the samples get associated with the
event that produced them, so when the expectation asks for one of them, ask
for "an id of some sort" on both sides, and when the expectation doesn't
ask for any, take the bits out of what got recorded: whether they are there
and which one it is are consequences of what was asked for and of how the
request got expanded, none of that is what these expectations are about.

Since Test.compare() looks at both directions, expectations matching the
recorded events and recorded events matching the expectations, keep track
of which side is the one perf recorded to take the bits out of the right
side.

The masking is only for the comparison: the warnings keep showing the
values as they are, nothing to un-mask by hand to see what is being
complained about.
