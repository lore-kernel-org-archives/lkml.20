Yes, good catch.

Following test loads successfully and then prints the empty range warning.

     call bpf_get_prandom_u32
     r6 = r0
     r6 <<= 32
     call bpf_get_prandom_u32
     r6 |= r0        /* r6 = full 64-bit unknown */
     w7 = w6            /* r7 is the zero extension */
     r8 = (s32)r6        /* r8 is the sign extension */
     if w7 != 5 goto 1f    /* new arm pins (u32)r6 to 5 */
     if w8 != 6 goto 1f    /* would pin it to 6 as well */
     r9 = 0
     r6 %= r9

v4 will give the new arm same prev/restore this code has.

Confirmed, that variant reaches empty range too. It exercises the two 
arms in sequence rather than this one twice.

FWIW, guarding only the new arm would have been enough for my first 
reproducer; it is this variant that shows both sites need the same 
post-condition. v4 routes both through one helper, which also takes the 
two gaps sashiko raised on 4/12 and 6/12: tnum_overlap() before 
tnum_intersect(), and a second range_bounds_violation() after 
reg_bounds_sync() rather than only before.

Nope. The arm is gated on which side carries the 32-bit kind:

     if ((known_reg->link_kind == BPF_REG_LINK_ZEXT ||
          known_reg->link_kind == BPF_REG_LINK_SEXT) && ...

so a BPF_REG_LINK_FULL known_reg never reaches it.

The comment now describes it by direction, and names that test.
