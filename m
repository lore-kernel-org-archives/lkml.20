It seems obviously correct (TM) to undo setting the features on error.

I think this needs clarification :)

The KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY series doesn't do this, or rather it only exposes the
ability for the pre-existing generic kvm_vcpu_pre_fault_memory() function to be
invoked by setting flags such as to expose pre-faulting as available for arm64.

So something like:

	The upcoming series that enables KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY exposes an
	existing bug in how vCPU initialisation is performed as it allows
	the generic kvm_vcpu_pre_fault_memory() function to be called which
	calls vcpu_load() before the vCPU might be initialised.

For that bit.

> such load NULL-dereferences in get_s2_mmu_nested() under mmu_lock.

Also I think this is a bit unclear, esp. the prior reference to 'second',
not clear what that refers to. I think you should bring in some of the
context you provide under the fold for the patch.

So clarify what you do i.e.:

1. KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT ioctl with an invalid configuration (HAS_EL2 |
   HAS_EL2_E2H0) - establishes the invalid kvm->arch.vcpu_features and
   doesn't clear down.

2. KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY - This call is benign, but it calls vcpu_put()
   which calls kvm_arch_vcpu_put() and that has:

		if (vcpu_has_nv(vcpu))
			kvm_vcpu_put_hw_mmu(vcpu);

  Since the broken config causes vcpu_has_nv() to return true, incorrectly,
  and causes:

  	vcpu->arch.hw_mmu = NULL;

  To be run even though the vCPU in fact has the canonical MMU...

3. KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY again - This time on load there's an issue:

	kvm_vcpu_pre_fault_memory()
	  -> vcpu_load()
	    -> kvm_arch_vcpu_load()

  Which has:

  	if (vcpu_has_nv(vcpu))
		kvm_vcpu_load_hw_mmu(vcpu);

  This leads to this path being taken:

		if (!vcpu->arch.hw_mmu) {
			scoped_guard(write_lock, &vcpu->kvm->mmu_lock)
				vcpu->arch.hw_mmu = get_s2_mmu_nested(vcpu);
		}

  And in get_s2_mmu_nested() it searches through the non-existent nested
  mmus leaving s2_mmu NULL, resulting in a NULL pointer deref on this line:

  	BUG_ON(atomic_read(&s2_mmu->refcnt)); /* We have struct MMUs to spare */

Hmm are 2 fixes really needed? It seems to me that commit 427733579744e
("KVM: arm64: Select default PMU in KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT handler") is the
right one because that added a step _after_ setting the bitmap that can go
wrong.

With the comments re: commit message/fixes tag addressed this seems correct
and a very good spot thanks! We very much need this for the pre fault
functionality.

I also think you should put the stack trace in the commit message, ideally
decoded via scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh!
