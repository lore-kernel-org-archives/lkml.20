Right, I_MHJZP says that if VTCR_EL2.HD is 1, then dirty state hardware 
management is enabled.

Then, R_XZFQH and R_BRFGY say that if (DBM+S2AP) bit combination is the 
given and the dirty state hardware management is enabled then a block 
descriptor is WC/WD.

R_XZFQH header, as an example:
For each translation stage using Direct permissions, if all of the 
following apply, then a Block descriptor or Page descriptor is described 
as writable-clean[...]

It says: 
"if all apply, the block is WC", 
it does not say 
"only if all apply, the block is WC".
so it forces one way, but not the other.

So I previously understood that we could also use the encoding for WC/WD in 
software, to avoid having 2 distinct encodings, when VTCR_EL2.HD=0. 

If that's not possible, as you mentioned, then yes, I failed to get that 
part. I also see that you mention it being RES0 when VTCR_EL2.HD==0, but I 
honestly could not find reference to that. :(

What I could find on Arm ARM M.cc was Table D8-53, which states for 
bit 51 that it's DBM if indirect permissions are disabled, or PIINDEX[1] 
if they are enabled. There is also no such information in D8.5.2 about this 
res0 behavior. 

So I am possibly missing the proper place to look for that information. 
Could you please share that with me so I can improve and maybe avoid being 
a inconvenience in the future?

Thanks!
Leo
