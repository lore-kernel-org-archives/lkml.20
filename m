nfsd polls a client that has accepted a CB_LAYOUTRECALL by sending the
callback again every 10 ms, with the stateid of the first callback. A
Linux client from v6.8 on answers the repeat with NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID,
and nfsd takes that as a failed recall. So a client that needs more than
10 ms to return a layout has the layout revoked and the fence path run.
With the block layout that client loses data it has written and synced,
with the SCSI layout it is cut off from the device. Patch 6 lets nfsd
keep polling instead.

A recall that takes longer makes the operation that started it wait
longer. When that operation is a WRITE, a SETATTR that changes the
size, an ALLOCATE, a DEALLOCATE, a CLONE or a COPY, the nfsd thread
serving it waits in XFS until the layouts are returned or the lease
break times out. As Chuck pointed out on v1, a few such requests can
take every nfsd thread, and the server then cannot serve the
LAYOUTRETURN that would release them. Patch 2 recalls the layouts
before the operation without waiting, gives the layouts of other
clients 30 ms to come back when it starts their recall, and otherwise
answers NFS4ERR_DELAY.

The cost of patch 2: a client that writes to a file through its layout
and, for writes that are not aligned, through the server recalls its
own layout with each such WRITE and has its LAYOUTGETs fail with
NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT meanwhile. In test 2 it wrote 48, 46 and 4 1 MiB
blocks through its layout in 30 seconds instead of 534, 537 and 505;
before, 6 of 7, 4 of 4 and 17 of 20 recalls ended in the failure path
and 7, 4 and 20 blocks were lost. The series on top of this one, with
the NFS client fix it needs, brings that to 193, 192 and 184 blocks.

Patches 3 to 5 are the others that patch 6 needs. Patch 3: the limit of
two lease periods on the poll has never triggered, and without it the
poll would have no end. Patch 4: for the block layout a lease break
gives up after fs.lease-break-time (45 s) without running
/sbin/nfsd-recall-failed. Until now the recall had failed long before
that; with patch 6 it is polled for up to two lease periods (180 s).
Patch 4 fences the client at fs.lease-break-time, as the SCSI layout
does since v7.1. Patch 5 then ends the recall, for both layout types:
polled on, the fenced client would keep every LAYOUTGET for the file
failing with NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT for up to 135 s, and its
LAYOUTCOMMIT would be applied after the operation that broke the lease.
Ending the recall drops its layouts, so what it wrote through them and
had not committed is lost. By default fs.lease-break-time is shorter
than the one lease period RFC 8881 section 12.5.5 has the server wait
after a recall.

Patch 1 fixes a lease break that hits a LAYOUTGET in progress and then
waits for a layout that is never recalled. It comes first because
patch 2 makes that common: the break of patch 2 runs outside the XFS
iolock, so it can land between the allocation of a layout stateid and
the insertion of its first layout.

Patch 6 also handles a client that a LAYOUTRETURN has moved past the
seqid of the recall. Such a client answers every poll
NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID and is never asked for the layouts it still holds,
so patch 6 polls a client that has not answered NFS4_OK with a new
seqid. Patch 7 deals with a client that answers NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID
after returning its last layout, which is fenced: it looks for layouts
first.

Patches 2 to 6 have to go together and need patch 1, also in stable
kernels; patch 7 stands on its own. If patch 2 should not go to stable,
patches 3 to 6 should not either; patches 1 and 7 can go alone. Kernels
before v7.1 do not have the lease break timeout that patches 4 and 5
fix, and take neither; there an operation on the server that does not
come from nfsd waits for the recall for up to two lease periods, as it
already does, without a limit, for a client that keeps answering
NFS4ERR_DELAY. Patch 2 uses nfsd_thread_local_info and needs adapting
where that is missing.

Tests. Tests 1 to 6 are from v2; the v3 runs are in test 7. QEMU guests
on one host: an nvmet-tcp target, the server (nfsd, XFS on the nvmet
namespace, pnfs export) and up to three clients, all on the same kernel
with KASAN and lockdep, NFS v4.2, block layout unless noted, O_DIRECT
I/O. "v2" is v2 of this series on nfsd-testing 56589cdb5881, "v1" is v1
on it, and "before" is that commit unless noted. No KASAN or lockdep
report on the server in any run, nor on the clients and the target in
tests 2, 3 and 5, where they were checked.

1. nfsd threads (patch 2), 4 nfsd threads. A client holds a layout of
   a file and its path to the device is cut for 70 s. Another client,
   without pNFS, sends 4 KiB WRITEs to the file through the server, all
   at once, and reads 4 KiB of another file every second:

                                            before     v1        v2
   8 WRITEs, NFSv4.0: the WRITEs take       46.7 s     -         45.2 s
     longest read of the other file         46.7 s     -         0.031 s
   64 WRITEs, NFSv4.0: the WRITEs take      -          49.2 s    45.4 s
     longest read of the other file         -          49.1 s    0.22 s
   8 WRITEs, NFSv3: the WRITEs take         47.0 s     -         51.2 s
     longest read of the other file         46.9 s     -         0.021 s

   The WRITEs wait for the lease break, which ends with
   /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed (patch 4). NFSv3 WRITEs take longer with
   v2 because the client waits 5 s after NFS3ERR_JUKEBOX. In the run
   with 64 WRITEs before this series, the recall failed after 10 ms, as
   described above, and the WRITEs were done in 0.5 s.

2. What patch 2 costs. Two clients write 1 MiB blocks to a new file for
   30 s, one through its layout and one (NFSv4.0) through the server,
   three runs. "+ follow-up" adds the nfsd series that goes on top of
   this one and an NFS client fix that it needs.

                      through the     of those, read      through the
                      layout          back as zeroes      server
   before             416/200/186     28/131/111          120/325/323
   v2                 174/176/170     0/0/0               184/203/220
   v2 + follow-up     170/175/176     0/0/0               284/223/207

   The 30 ms wait is what keeps the writer through the server going:
   two earlier revisions of v2 + follow-up that differ only in it gave
   79/79/80 blocks through the server without the wait and 238/230/137
   with it.

   One client doing both, 1 MiB blocks through its layout and 512 byte
   writes through the server:

                      through the     of those, read      writes through
                      layout          back as zeroes      the server
   before             534/537/505     7/4/20              32/21/87
   v2                 48/46/4         0/0/0               3600/3262/4917
   v2 + follow-up     193/192/184     0/0/0               1082/1488/1669

   With v2 alone, each WRITE of that client through the server recalls
   its layout. About half of its LAYOUTGETs then meet that recall and
   get NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT, as before; the other half are in
   progress when the WRITE breaks the lease, and patch 1 fails them.
   The Linux client waits up to 15 s between LAYOUTGETs that fail with
   NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT. The follow-up hands out the layout of such a
   LAYOUTGET and recalls it at once. That needs the referring call the
   follow-up adds to CB_LAYOUTRECALL: tried in this series, the recall
   overtook the LAYOUTGET reply, and in all three runs 92 to 104 of
   about 260 blocks read back as zeroes.

   On 214e388464bf, before and v2 gave the same picture, except that in
   one of three runs of the one-client case with v2 one block read back
   as zeroes, through the recall race described under "Not changed".

   The series applies to nfsd-testing c32fef6c476d unchanged, and there
   before and v2 gave the same picture again, also for NFSv3, whose
   replies now come from xdrgen. In test 1 the longest read of the
   other file was 47.8 s before and 0.036 s with v2 over NFSv4.0, and
   48.3 s and 0.019 s over NFSv3, where the WRITEs took 48.4 s and
   51.3 s. In this test, with two clients, 48, 94 and 90 of 180, 185
   and 181 blocks through the layout read back as zeroes before, and
   none of 161, 177 and 172 with v2; with one client, 8, 0 and 3
   before and none with v2.

   Writes to a file without leases: fio, NFSv4.0, no KASAN or lockdep,
   10 runs of 30 s, medians without and with an earlier revision of v2
   (the same path for such a file): 1 MiB sequential 65.8 and 67.5
   MiB/s, 4 KiB random 262 and 263 IOPS.

3. Recall polling (patches 3, 4 and 6). With v2 no recall ended in the
   failure path (0 of 9, 9, 63 and 277 in the arms of patch 6) and no
   block written to a new file was lost (0 of 545, 511, 477, 577 and
   36). Patch 6 has the runs before.
   On c32fef6c476d, four of those arms lost 4, 2, 18 and 9 blocks
   before, with 46 recall failures logged, and none with v2, with no
   recall failure.

4. One client writing through a block layout whose path to the device
   is cut while it can still talk to the server, and a 4 KiB write to
   the file on the server ("before" of the 15 s case is 32eb1a60b456).
   The client's write that is in flight stays stuck until the path is
   back.

                                                   before      v2
   path cut for 15 s: the server write takes       0.05 s      15.6 s
     the recall                                    fails       completes
     /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed is run               at once     no
   path cut for 70 s: the server write takes       0.05 s      47.2 s
     /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed is run               at once     at 47.1 s

   The same 70 s case with a script that expires the client it fences
   through /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/<clid>/ctl: with v1's fence worker,
   which runs the script itself, the script never finished and the
   server write went on only after the path was back, after 93 s. With
   v2 the script was done 36 ms after it started, and the server write
   took 46.1 s. With a lease time of 15 s, the recall reaches its limit
   (patch 3) after 30 s, before the lease break times out, and the
   recall failure path runs the script: there it hangs with v2 as well,
   the script in nfsd4_shutdown_callback() and rpciod in
   call_usermodehelper_exec().

5. A lease break during a LAYOUTGET (patch 1). With v2 the longest of
   424 writes on the server took 55 ms, and 108 ms with a delay of
   100 ms added to LAYOUTGET for the test. Patch 1 has the runs without
   it.

6. SCSI layout. The target runs a kernel with "nvmet: fix preempt of
   another registrant by the reservation holder" [1], so that the
   preempt removes the registration. With v2, the path of a client cut
   for 15 s: the server write takes 15.2 s and the client is not
   fenced; cut for 70 s: 47.6 s, and the fence worker fences the client
   (registrants 2 -> 1).

7. v3, on nfsd-testing 78c334bc5ae6, the same guests and kernels with
   KASAN and lockdep. "before" is that commit, and "v2" is v2 of this
   series rebased onto it without changes. No KASAN or lockdep report on
   the server in any v3 run.

   - Test 1, 8 WRITEs: over NFSv4.0 the WRITEs took 48.4 s before and
     45.2 s with v3, and the longest read of the other file 48.4 s and
     0.027 s. Over NFSv3 they took 51.4 s with v3 and the longest read
     0.008 s; before, the recall failed after 10 ms in that run and the
     WRITEs were done at once.
   - Two clients writing 600 1 MiB blocks each to a new file through
     their layouts, three runs: before, 13 and 7 blocks of one client
     read back as zeroes in two runs; with v3 none. One client writing
     through its layout and through the server with unaligned writes:
     before, 12 of 600 blocks read back as zeroes in one of three runs;
     with v3, 52, 13 and 54 blocks through the layout and none zero.
   - Test 3's arms: before, 34 recalls ended in the failure path and 5
     blocks read back as zeroes; with v3, none and none.
   - Test 4 with v3: path cut for 15 s, the server write took 15.4 s and
     the recall completed. Cut for 70 s, the script ran when the lease
     break timed out, the server write went on after 48.4 s, and the
     recall ended right after the script (patch 5); the client's
     LAYOUTCOMMIT when its path was back got NFS4ERR_BADLAYOUT. With v2
     the recall ended when the client returned its layout, and that
     LAYOUTCOMMIT was applied. With the script that expires the client,
     it was done 19 ms after it started.
   - Cut for 210 s: the script ran once with v2 and with v3. With v2 the
     recall was polled until its time limit, 180 s after it started;
     with v3 it ended right after the script, 47.5 s after it started.
     The same with the SCSI layout (test 6): the fence worker fenced the
     client with both, and with v3 the recall ended 10 ms after the
     fence.
   - An 8 MiB asynchronous COPY into a file whose layout holder has its
     path cut for 70 s (patch 2): with v2 the copy kthread waited in XFS
     and the COPY was done after 48 s; with v3 it got NFS4ERR_DELAY 9
     times and was done after 84 s, 31 s after the holder was fenced at
     a retry 53 s in. Without the cut, about 50 ms either way. The data
     was in place in all four runs.
   - Read from the code, not run: the inter-server COPY path of patch 2,
     the retry of a failed allocation in patch 4, and the loss of what a
     fenced client wrote and had not committed (patch 5).

pynfs BLOCK1, BLOCK2, BLOCK4 and BLOCK5 pass before and with v2 (BLOCK3
fails in both with a TypeError in the test), and the same with v3 on
78c334bc5ae6. The commit messages of patches 6 and 7 have pynfs clients
that answer as described there.

Not changed by these patches:

- A layout granted between the check of patch 2 and the break in XFS
  still makes the nfsd thread wait. No new layout lease is granted
  while a break is pending, so that needs a LAYOUTGET for a file that
  had no layout at the check. For an asynchronous COPY the window is
  the whole copy: a layout granted for its destination while it runs
  makes the copy kthread wait in XFS at its next 4 MiB step.

- The recall failure path still runs /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed from
  nfsd4_cb_layout_done(), in rpciod, while the callback is in flight.
  A script that expires the client it fences hangs there, because the
  teardown waits for that callback in nfsd4_shutdown_callback(); test 4
  shows it. Neither path looks at the exit status of the script, and
  the recall failure path does not look at the result of
  ->fence_client(): a fence that fails is taken as done there, and the
  layouts it drops end the retries of a fence worker that a lease break
  has started (patch 3 says so).

- nfsd still polls a client that has answered NFS4_OK with the seqid it
  has used, where RFC 8881 section 12.5.3 has the server increment the
  seqid in each request. Patch 6 only makes nfsd bear the answer and
  gives a new seqid only to a client that has not answered NFS4_OK,
  and while it polls, nfsd sends a callback every 10 ms for up to two
  lease periods.

- CB_LAYOUTRECALL carries no referring call, as CB_RECALL does since
  "NFSD: Send referring calls with CB_RECALL". When a recall overtakes
  the reply to the LAYOUTGET that created the layout stateid, the Linux
  client answers NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT, nfsd drops the layout and
  the client uses it afterwards. nfsd also trusts
  NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT while it still has layouts on the layout
  stateid. The series on top of this one adds the referring call and
  resends the recall once before it trusts that answer, and with it
  recalls a layout handed out by a LAYOUTGET that a lease break met,
  instead of failing that LAYOUTGET (see test 2).

- Which client makes progress when several clients use one file: the
  client that holds a layout now keeps it while it does I/O through it,
  where before its layout was revoked after 10 ms. Beyond the limits
  above, nothing here keeps one client from getting its layout back
  right after returning it and keeping others out again.

- A LAYOUTCOMMIT that a fenced client sends before the next poll ends
  its recall is still applied: nfsd4_layoutcommit() does not look at
  ls_fenced. That window lasts until the next answer to the recall: 10
  ms while the client answers.

Changes in v3:
- Patch 2: recall the layouts of a COPY before it is split into a
  synchronous and an asynchronous copy, so that an asynchronous COPY
  gets NFS4ERR_DELAY as well; an inter-server COPY recalls only its
  destination. Keep the kernel-doc to the contract and the comments
  short, as Chuck asked:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/deacbd2d-a82f-4691-92e5-0ea98856c3cc@slotpi15m67
- Patch 4, as Chuck suggested: retry a failed allocation of the script
  work item with the backoff of a failed ->fence_client(), skip the
  fence in nfsd4_cb_layout_done() when ls_fenced is set, and build the
  script arguments in one helper. The fence worker clears ls_file when
  it is done, so that path did not fence a second time before either;
  it still can while the worker's script runs. The recall failure path
  still runs the script synchronously, as the layouts are dropped right
  after it:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/166857d6-bb91-4731-8a94-a6a7fbb722e4@slotpi15m67
- New patch 5 ends the recall once the fence worker of a lease break is
  done, for both layout types, and the layouts are dropped then. Polling
  the fenced client until the time limit kept LAYOUTGETs for the file
  failing with NFS4ERR_RECALLCONFLICT for up to 135 s and applied its
  LAYOUTCOMMIT after the operation that broke the lease.
- Squash v2 patches 5 and 6 into patch 6, as Jeff asked, and shorten
  their comments:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/574bebd564ccb710cb5217998fdda5588361d12d.camel@kernel.org
- Jeff's Reviewed-by is on patches 1, 3, 6 and 7, and not on patches
  2, 4 and 5, which changed or are new.
- Rebased onto nfsd-testing 78c334bc5ae6, which has "nfsd: prevent a
  double put of revoked layout stateids", without conflicts.

Changes in v2:
- New patch 2, which recalls the layouts without waiting before an
  operation that modifies the file and answers NFS4ERR_DELAY, as Chuck
  asked:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/63ef8d7c-086f-4cc8-84bb-72c1b23bf596@slotpi15m67
- v1 4/6 is now patch 1, ahead of patch 2, which makes its case common.
  v1 1/6 to 3/6 are patches 3 to 5, v1 5/6 and 6/6 are patches 6 and 7.
- Sashiko on v1:
  - 2/6, the fence script waiting for itself when it expires the client
    through /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/<clid>/ctl: patch 4 runs the script
    in a work item on a new workqueue, nfsd4_fence, and the fence
    worker checks every 100 ms whether it is done. Teardown waits only
    for the fence worker, which no longer waits for the script.
  - 2/6, sleeping fence workers filling system_dfl_wq: the same change;
    a script that runs long occupies nfsd4_fence.
  - 3/6, ktime_get() stops during suspend: patch 3 takes the time with
    ktime_get_boottime().
  - 5/6, si_generation written under sc_lock in ->done and read under
    ls_mutex only: patch 6 reads it under sc_lock in
    nfsd4_preprocess_layout_stateid() as well.
  - 1/6, the result of ->fence_client() not looked at on the recall
    failure path, which also ends the retries of the fence worker: not
    changed, said in patch 3. Patch 3 makes the path reachable after two
    lease periods for a client that keeps answering; before, a client
    from v6.8 on reached it after 10 ms.
  - 2/6, the exit status of the script not looked at: not changed.
    Retrying a failed script would block the file for good on a server
    that has no /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed. Said in patch 4.
  - 6/6, NFS4ERR_NOMATCHING_LAYOUT trusted while layouts are left:
    preexisting, not changed here (see the list above).
- Rebased onto nfsd-testing c32fef6c476d without changes, and tests 1
  to 3 run again there.
- Test numbers in the cover from v2; the commit messages of patches 1,
  4 and 5 keep their runs on nfsd-testing 32eb1a60b456 for the side
  without the patch. Commit messages with one space after a period.
