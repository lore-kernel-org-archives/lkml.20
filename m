The MMU-600 in front of the PCIe controllers of the Rockchip RK3588
(mmu600_pcie) is enabled for every RK3588 board, but its node does not
describe its clock (ACLK_MMU_PCIE). Any enabled PCIe controller holds
that clock, which is why nobody noticed: on a board that enables none
of them (an Orange Pi 5 with its M.2 slot in SATA mode, or any RK3588
board without PCIe), the clock framework gates the clock as unused
after boot, while arm-smmu-v3 stays bound. The SMMU registers then stop
responding: at reboot, arm_smmu_device_shutdown() writes CR0 and polls
CR0ACK, "reboot: Restarting system" is never reached and the board only
comes back ~90 s later when the watchdog fires.

Patch 1 allows a single clock and a single reset in the arm,smmu-v3
binding (arm,smmu.yaml already allows clocks for the earlier SMMUs).
Patch 2 makes the driver get and enable the optional clock of its
firmware node first in probe, before any register access, for as long
as it is bound; nodes without a clock (and ACPI/IORT systems) are
unaffected. Patch 3 describes the clock in rk3588-base.dtsi, and patch
4 the reset (SRST_A_MMU_PCIE). Patches 1 and 2 are for the iommu tree,
patches 3 and 4 for the Rockchip tree once the binding is accepted.

This series is related to Pranjal Shrivastava's "iommu/arm-smmu-v3:
Implement Runtime/System Sleep ops" v11 (2026-09-29,
20260929034510.2023173-1-praan@google.com, not merged), which adds
pm_domain-based runtime PM and resumes the SMMU around shutdown, but has
no clock handling. The two are compatible: once it lands, the clock from
patch 2 should move into its runtime suspend/resume callbacks.

The second MMU-600 of the RK3588 (mmu600_php), which Shawn Lin asked
about, is disabled in rk3588-base.dtsi and is not changed here. Giving
it the same handling, as Heiko Stuebner suggested, needs a test with
that SMMU enabled and is left for a separate series.

Tested on an Orange Pi 5 (RK3588S) with the M.2 slot in SATA mode and
the root filesystem on the SATA SSD, where every reboot used to hang.
v1 (clock and PD_PCIE power domain): three consecutive reboots printed
"reboot: Restarting system" and the boot loader started 0.6 s later
(previously ~89 s, from the watchdog); clk_summary showed aclk_mmu_pcie
enabled with iommu@fc900000 as consumer; the SMMU probed as before and
SATA kept running at 6.0 Gbps without errors. With the power domain
alone (clock still gated) the reboot still hung at "arm-smmu-v3
fc900000.iommu: shutdown" on the serial console. Boards with PCIe
enabled are already in the state this series describes.

v2 (clock only, no power domain; patches 2 and 3, together with the
separately sent CMDQV fix, on a 7.3 kernel):
again three consecutive reboots printed "reboot: Restarting system" and
the boot loader started 0.59 s later each time; clk_summary showed
aclk_mmu_pcie enabled with fc900000.iommu as consumer; arm-smmu-v3
probed without errors or deferrals in all four boots; the root
filesystem stayed on the SATA SSD at 6.0 Gbps with no ATA errors, and
the kernel log had no warnings.

Patch 4 only completes the hardware description: the driver does not
use the reset, which is already deasserted at boot, so the board test of
the clock change covers all functional changes of this series.

This series was developed with Claude (Anthropic) as a coding assistant:
it wrote the code and the commit messages, and I reviewed and tested
every change as described above.

Changes in v2:
- The existing Tegra CMDQV reference leak on a bad #iommu-cells that
  the Sashiko AI review of v1 found is fixed in a separate patch,
  "iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Don't leak the CMDQV device on a bad
  #iommu-cells", as it is not related to this series.
- Dropped the v1 patches that allowed power-domains in the binding and
  put the SMMU in RK3588_PD_PCIE: the TRM puts MMU600_PCIE in PD_PHP,
  which Linux does not control (rk3588-base.dtsi has no PD_PHP node), so
  no power domain is needed (Sebastian Reichel, Shawn Lin). The hang was
  the clock alone, now tested on its own.
- Binding: allow a single clock with a description instead of up to
  four unconstrained clocks, and say why in the commit message (Sashiko
  AI review, Sebastian Reichel).
- Driver: get one optional clock to match the binding, and get it
  before the firmware probe, so that a failure or -EPROBE_DEFER cannot
  leak the CMDQV device reference (Sashiko AI review). Its comment now
  only says why the clock is got first (Sebastian Reichel). Sebastian's
  Reviewed-by of v1 is not carried over, as the patch changed.
- DTS: the clock patch's commit message now gives the whole cause on
  its own (clock gated as unused, SMMU registers no longer respond, hang
  in arm_smmu_device_shutdown()). Its diff is the same as in v1, so
  Sebastian's Reviewed-by is kept.
- Added the reset line to the binding and the PCIe SMMU node (new
  patch 4) (Sebastian Reichel).
- Capitalized the patch subjects.
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20261110-smmu-v3-pcie-pd-v1-0-628819ca44b9@gmail.com
