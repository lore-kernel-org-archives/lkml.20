If bcma finds both of these devices via EROM, why do they need a
"brcm,iproc-pcie" compatible?  If we omitted that compatible, what
would break?

Sorry to be dense, I'm probably asking dumb questions because I'm not
a DT expert.  I just imagine DT as being a substitute for native
enumeration protocols (e.g., PCI, ACPI, EROM), and as specific to a
piece of hardware, so this single DT that describes enumerable devices
with incompatible addresses doesn't fit my simple mental model.
