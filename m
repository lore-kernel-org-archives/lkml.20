Oooh, right, unassigned a page in the RMP only needs the PFN, but assigned a page
needs the ASID and GFN.

Nit, don't reference functions by name when it's easy-ish to avoid doing so.  And
don't give a play-by-play: the patch makes it pretty obvious the code is iterating
over folios, what isn't obvious is *why* the code does that.

Exaclty what SNP does isn't relevant.  Or rather, it's but on example of how this
needs to work.  I.e. the conversion needs to happen within the invalidtion sequence
because thems the rules for KVM.

To me, this isn't a valid argument.  We've fully committed to relying on vendor
specific behavior, and SNP can't truly work like TDX because the underlying
implementations are so different.

It's not just complexity, it's that the bindings might not even exist.  I.e. for
all intents and purposes, doing on-demand updates is mandatory, because that's the
only time a relevant memslot binding is guaranteed to exist.

All in all, this?

   When doing in-place conversion from PRIVATE to SHARED, immediately inform
   arch code of the conversion for all allocated pages/folios, e.g. so that
   arch code can put hardware metadata tables in the correct state.  Eagerly
   updating the table for to SHARED conversions avoids having to implement
   on-demand updates, e.g. when faulting in host userspace mappings.  Skip
   the entire flow if the arch doesn't implement conversion callbacks, as
   getting folios from the filemap is noticeably expensive, especially when
   converting large chunks of memory.

   Deliberately don't eagerly update the metadata table on conversions from
   SHARED to PRIVATE, because assigning a page to a VM (versus "returning" it
   to the host) requires the exact GFN associated with the page, i.e would
   require walking the memslot bindings.  And because KVM *must* do on-demand
   metadata updates when getting a PFN for KVM-internal usage, as that's the
   only time a relevant memslot binding is guaranteed to exist.

   Note!  Inform arch code of the conversion within the protection of the
   invalidation sequence, to ensure that any existing mappings are dropped
   before hardware is updated, and to ensure that new mappings can't be
   established until after the conversion is complete.
