Here's RFC v3 of guest_memfd alternative providers.

This RFC is meant to show line of sight to a few things, and will have to be
split into a few series for upstreaming:

1. Supporting alternative folio providers (tmpfs used for illustration)
     ends at "KVM: selftests: Test guest_memfd conversions with tmpfs backing"
2. Introducing a sample memory provider
     ends at "KVM: selftests: Test marking page ranges read-only"
3. Supporting pfn-mode providers in KVM
     ends at "KVM: selftests: Test flag dependency of PFN_MODE on USE_RESOURCE"
4. Making sample memory provider a guest_memfd pfn-mode provider
     ends at "KVM: selftests: Test guest_memfd conversions with sample memory provider backing"
5. Making VFIO a guest_memfd pfn-mode provider
     ends at the last patch

I was trying to get this to work at a conceptual level:

In this version, after working with VFIO, the provider fd should be clarified as
the provider control/config plane fd.

* tmpfs: the directory fd is used as the control plane, since it indicates which
  mount to get folios from, what the mount config is, etc
* sample memory provider: the provider file fd doesn't allow access to memory
  (data plane), but is a handle for memory that is pre-carved out using
  alloc_contig_pages()
* VFIO: I added a VFIO_DEVICE_BIND_FLAG_CTRL_ONLY flag for
  VFIO_DEVICE_BIND_IOMMUFD, which partitions VFIO operations into data plane
  (mmap_supported + some ioctls) and control plane (everything else, which I
  think shouldn't be used for Confidential IO, and gmem doesn't want to manage
  anyway)

The split between vfio fd and gmem fd is this:

* gmem fd: Read/write/mmap mappable BARs 0-5 from userspace and stage 2, and
           conversions
* vfio fd: Read/write everything else. mmap, ioeventfd, and dmabufs are blocked
           for CTRL_ONLY

I also formalized Sean's suggestion of gmem requiring exclusive access to the
resource, which shows up in the locking requirements (I updated the docstrings
for all the gmem provider ops accordingly).

For VFIO, this is implemented as a .bars_available field. On attach, we take
dev_set->lock in vfio to store .gmem_inode, while vfio-pci takes ->memory_lock
and initializes .bars_available based on whether memory decoding is enabled and
the device is awake.

After setting .bars_available = true, gmem has exclusive access to the data
plane for VFIO, which should be everything needed for Confidential IO. gmem will
use its filemap_invalidate_lock for VFIO operations. Everything on the VFIO side
is locklessly checked.

Revoking from the VFIO side first sets .bars_available = false to block racing
accesses from gmem, then calls kvm_gmem_revoke().

For testing VFIO, I selected igb as the test driver since it is the most
full-featured yet can work with my qemu testing setup :). mdpy and mtty don't
use vfio-pci so they don't use ->memory_lock.

And then when I introduced the last test on read/write I realized this
implementation has a slightly different behavior between vfio and gmem-wrapped
vfio, which is that the reads/writes to the gmem-wrapped version doesn't
automatically get the device out of low power mode. I don't like this slight
difference required.

It doesn't get the device out of low power mode because getting the device out
of low power mode involves taking vdev->memory_lock, and this model commits to
not taking the lock while holding the filemap_invalidate_lock() in gmem.

The problem here is that read/write needs to take a provider side lock, but
guest_memfd, the caller, needs to hold the filemap_invalidate_lock() to make
sure shared/private state doesn't change during the read. Holding
filemap_invalidate_lock() while taking the provider side lock
(vdev->memory_lock) causes an ABBA locking issue. Not taking the provider lock
is possible but results in slightly different functionality.

Aneesh's version [1] didn't implement read/write. I think David mentioned during
gmem biweekly it shouldn't be that hard, so I tried and that turned out to be
_the_ challenge, lol. From a gmem provider perspective, the goal is to try and
get line of sight to a broad set of providers, hence VFIO's read/write is a good
challenge. Either way, I do think we should try to preserve as much vfio
functionality even after wrapping with gmem.

Aneesh, I think I'm finally at a point where I have enough background
understanding to compare our approaches, so I'll get to that after KVM forum.

I didn't get around to prototyping the Confidential stuff but I still want to
post this because our proposals differ very much in the exclusive access and
locking setup, and I'd like to get your help to also see if the
Confidential-specific parts of gmem+VFIO works, and if there are other parts we
can converge on. I left a patch prefixed QUESTION for the CoCo community.

At a higher level, I'm really trying to make VFIO not that different a provider
from other PFN providers.

Sean/Aneesh, it turns out that ARM relies on the VMA to determine cacheability
in stage-2 page tables. Since guest_memfd memory may not have a VMA, reporting
cacheability somehow from provider (VFIO) via guest_memfd to KVM makes sense
imo. In "KVM: guest_memfd: Support reporting PFN cacheability", for x86, I just
left a WARN-ing if there's a discrepancy to be resolved.

Fred, these are the other changes more relevant for the regular PFN provider:

* Cleaned up the sample memory provider (formerly MPS) implementation and added
  selftests.
* Fixed bug in the RFCv2, MPS' .lookup_pfn_range() implementation always
  returned nr_pages = 1, but it can return much more than nr_pages = 1. The
  intent was to have nr_pages be as large as possible to indicate the full
  contiguous block beginning at the returned PFN.
* .lookup_pfn_range() will now set *nr_pages on -ENOENT to indicate the size of
  the hole. This helps with VFIO since the holes are huge and iterating would be
  sad.
* Added the readonly support within KVM ("KVM: guest_memfd: Support reporting
  PFN attributes")
* Didn't get around to verifying proper support for more than order 0 PFN ranges

This was built on kvm/next, and the series is also available here for your
convenience:
