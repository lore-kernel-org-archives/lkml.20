Not sure and actually the point here is about opting in for using
-EPROBE_DEFER in consumer drivers (so that they have a choice on probe
deferral rather than being deferred behind their back).

I implemented devlink supports for these platform devices but I don't
think it is best way forward - given this discussion.
