Yes, reading io_cpu locklessly in the I/O hot path is intentional. However,
to avoid KCSAN splat, we should mark read and write access with READ_ONCE()
and WRITE_ONCE() respectively.

Unfortunately, the Clang context analyzer cannot currently model a lock that
serializes writers while allowing readers to access the protected variable
without holding that lock. Annotating io_cpu with __guarded_by() would therefore
require us to annotate lockless reads with context_unsafe() or data_race(),
which I think we'd prefer to avoid.

I suggest introducing two helpers: one to read io_cpu and another to update it:

static inline int nvme_tcp_queue_io_cpu(struct nvme_tcp_queue *queue)
{
	return READ_ONCE(queue->io_cpu);
}

static inline void nvme_tcp_queue_change_io_cpu(struct nvme_tcp_queue *queue,
		int cpu)
	__must_hold(&queue->ctrl->io_cpu_lock)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(queue->io_cpu, cpu);
}

All readers could then access queue->io_cpu through nvme_tcp_queue_io_cpu(),
while all writes would go through nvme_tcp_queue_change_io_cpu(). The __must_hold()
annotation on the update helper would allow the Clang context analyzer to verify
that callers hold io_cpu_lock when modifying io_cpu, without requiring annotations
for the intentional lockless reads.

May not be true always when nvme_tcp_wq is inited with wq_unbound. We
have a module option using which we could toggle this behavior.

This looks good. However, I wonder why we need to check NVME_TCP_Q_ALLOCATED
here? If the user can update io_cpu only while the queue's sysfs directory
exists, and that directory is created and removed along with the queue's
allocation and teardown, shouldn't we be able to drop this check?
