Trust me it was never about being nice to FW guys :P

The reasoning, which I am indeed myself questioning these days, was to
be able to carry on and boot a minimal Telemetry working system even
without all of the detailed description retrieved by this command
enumeration process since all of that data descriptors are NOT strictly
needed, unless yout system defines groups or FastChannels.

Because on one side it is true thet DE_DESCRIPTION is a mandatory
command BUT on the other side it is also true that the spec does really
delegate any further detailed description of the Telemetry data to some
external JSON-like file: so you can really carry on without all of this
informational and topological data.

As an example if userspace does not want to use kernel mediated access
to the Telemetry data (most of the IOCTL ABI later on) but instead it
decides to grab and parse directly the RAW mmaped data from the SHMTI/TDCF,
in that case you just need the fds to the areas to mmap and its fully
comprehensive (hopefully) JSON file.

Another possible scenario is bring-up with a limited features FW.

This is also the reasoning behind having the lazy resource enumeration:
you can boot, get the SHMTIs fds and mmap those areas and that's it:
you're good to go without doing any enumeration at all.

There were more FW issues indeed that I used to 'survive' early in this
series that I stop being graceful about it, and even in this case, despite
surviving in a degraded state I printout a FW_BUG.

Now the bad side of the story is that keeping half-initialized stuff
in a degraded system lead to an increasing number of possible issues
flagged by Sashiko, mostly rare errors on path conditions to fix, but
I am starting to wonder if all of this is worth...

Thanks,
Cristian
