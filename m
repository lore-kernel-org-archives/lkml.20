Interesting idea.

How would that work for devices that want early display support ? In
particular, how does it interact with your recent work on "fastboot"
support (with the kernel drivers taking over a running display
configured by the boot loader) ?

I'm also wondering about the incentives for vendors to upstream the
code. How will we avoid having a proliferation of out-of-tree drivers ?
