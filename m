It looks like the early ones are straightforward and good-to-go.  How
many could we just apply in order to get them out of the way?
I'm guessing at least the first six (up to and including "PCI: Derive
aligns[] array size in a define")?

You mentioned "this also causes yet another regression" so I assume
there's something we're not quite ready to merge yet?  I'd like to get
the rest in linux-next as soon as we can.
