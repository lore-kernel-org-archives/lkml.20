Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

As arm-smmu-v3 rapidly finds its way into SoCs designed for hand-held
devices, power management capabilities, similar to its predecessors, are
crucial for these applications. This series introduces power management
support for the arm-smmu-v3 driver.

Design
======
The arm-smmu-v3 primarily operates with in-memory data structures
through HW registers pointing to these data structures. The proposed design
makes use of this fact for implementing suspend and resume ops, centered
around a software gate embedded in the command queue.

1. CMDQ Gate (CMDQ_PROD_STOP_FLAG)
To safely manage runtime PM without regressing performance on high core
count servers or systems not opting for runtime power management,
this series introduces a CMDQ_PROD_STOP_FLAG (bit 30) in the command
queue's producer index. The flag acts as a Point of Commitment in the
cmpxchg loop of arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmdlist(), ensuring no new indices
are reserved once suspension begins.

2. Suspend / Resume Flow
The suspend operation follows a multi-stage quiesce sequence:
  a. Stop Traffic: Sets SMMUEN=0 and GBPA=Abort to halt new transactions.
  b. Gate CMDQ: Sets the CMDQ_PROD_STOP_FLAG to block new submissions.
  c. Command Flush: Waits for any in-flight "owner" threads to commit
     their reserved indices to hardware.
  d. SW Quiesce: Waits for all concurrent threads to release the shared
     cmdq->lock, ensuring no CPUs are left polling CONS register.
  e. HW Drain: Polls the CMDQ until all committed commands are consumed.
  f. IRQ Quiesce: Disables hardware IRQs and waits for racing handlers to
     complete via synchronize_irq()

Entering the suspend sequence implies that the device has no active
clients. In v8, a surgical state-correction is added to runtime_suspend:
if draining fails, the software trackers (cons and owner_prod) are forced
to align with the masked producer index. This voids any stale commands for
the next session and prevents deadlocks or spurious executions upon
resumption.

The resume operation clears the STOP_FLAG & performs a full device
reset via arm_smmu_device_reset(), which re-initializes the HW using the
SW-copies maintained by the driver and clears all cached configurations.

3. Guarding Hardware Access and Elision
The driver ensures the SMMU is active before hardware access via
arm_smmu_rpm_get() and arm_smmu_rpm_put() helpers. To maintain code
clarity, invalidation call-sites no longer perform manual elision checks;
instead, elision is authoritative within the CMDQ submission path.

The renamed helper, arm_smmu_is_active(), is preserved only for
critical diagnostic (ATC), early-drop (Page Response), and gerror
short-circuits. For ATC invalidations, devlinks must guarantee the SMMU
is active if the endpoint is active; a WARN_ON_ONCE() catches
inconsistencies.

4. Implementation-Specific Quiescing (Tegra VCMDQ)
Implementation-specific gating and draining are consolidated into
a unified quiesce_and_drain_queues callback. The tegra241-cmdqv driver
is updated to gate all active local virtual queues (VINTF0) before
draining.

5. Interrupt Re-config
a. Wired irqs: The series refactors arm_smmu_setup_irqs to allow
separate installation of handlers, aiding in correct re-initialization.

b. MSIs: The genirq/msi core caches the msi_msg in
irq_chip_write_msi_msg() and provides msi_device_domain_restore_msi_msgs(),
which arm_smmu_resume_msis() invokes during resume.

c. GERROR: Late-breaking global errors are captured and handled
immediately after SMMU disablement during suspend to ensure no diagnostic
information is lost.

Scalability and Performance
===========================
A key design goal of this series is to ensure that high-performance
systems (typically servers) that do not enable runtime PM are not
penalized. By embedding a stop flag in the command queue's producer
index and designing RPM helpers to perform only read-only checks when
RPM is disabled, command submission on these systems incurs negligible
overhead. Power-managed systems only utilize runtime PM atomics as
necessary, ensuring that scalability is maintained across all hardware
classes.

Sashiko Reviews and Documentation
=================================
The series was run through Sashiko locally. In response to the review
feedback, extensive verbose comments have been added across the series to
thoroughly document hardware/software synchronization invariants, memory
ordering dependencies (Point of Commitment, dma_wmb vs. smp_mb), and
devlink power guarantees. Several edge-case race conditions, unmasking
bugs, and resource leak paths were also addressed.

[v11]
 - Replaced platform_device_msi_rewrite() and driver-side msi_msg caching
   with generic genirq/msi core support as suggested and provided by tglx
   (Thomas Gleixner):
   * Cache desc->msg in irq_chip_write_msi_msg() and document why the
     assignment in __pci_write_msi_msg() remains for direct callers.
   * Provide msi_device_domain_restore_msi_msgs() in kernel/irq/msi.c.
   * Update arm_smmu_resume_msis() to call msi_device_domain_restore_msi_msgs()
     and drop manual msi_msg caching from arm_smmu_write_msi_msg().
 - Rebased onto v7.3-rc4.

 - Picked up common drain helpers from Nicolin's PRI series v3 [1].
 - Introduced platform_device_msi_rewrite() in platform/msi core
   (suggested by Jason).
 - Fixed the stale interrupt issue caused by calling arm_smmu_setup_irqs()
   early in probe (as reported by Sashiko in v9) by passing a bool to 
   arm_smmu_device_reset() to ensure irqs aren't set-up again on resume.
 - Fixed a CMDQ gate bypass race where threads waking from 
   poll_until_not_full() could commit commands after STOP_FLAG was asserted
 - Fixed a masking issue in __arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmdlist() & tegra241-cmdqv
 - Added tegra241_vcmdq_wait_quiescent() to wait for in-flight owner threads
 - Fixed VCMDQ drain loop error handling to continue draining remaining
   queues rather than abandoning them on timeout (pointed by Sashiko in v9)
 - Explicitly zeroed *_IRQ_CFG0 registers during resume as they reset to
   unknown values.
 - Cleared ARM_SMMU_FEAT_MSI on MSI setup fallback to avoid spurious
   MSI rewrites on resume.
 - Retitled GERROR patch to "Factor out arm_smmu_handle_gerror()" for clarity
 - Handled devlink creation failure in arm_smmu_probe_device()
 - Added checks for the retval of arm_smmu_rpm_get() in 
   arm_smmu_disable_action() & arm_smmu_device_shutdown()
 - Clarified rationale for asynchronous put in teardown and shutdown paths
   where hardware has already been explicitly disabled.
 - Documented safety of eliding ATC invalidations during suspend based on
   PCIe link power states and devlink guarantees per Jason's comment.
 - Fixed stack timer lifecycle in KUnit tests using timer_setup_on_stack()
   and timer_destroy_on_stack(), and resolved mock register endianness.
 - Added extensive verbose comments across the patches explaining locking,
   synchronization invariants, and devlink power guarantees based on local
   Sashiko review.
 - Collected Reviewed-by tags from Jason Gunthorpe.

   only for diagnostic/safety paths (ATC, GERROR, Page Response).

 - Updated tegra241-cmdqv to gate virtual queues before draining,
   addressing non-deterministic timeouts from guest-side submissions.
