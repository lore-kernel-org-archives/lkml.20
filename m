Hmm, let's look at where the tracepoints added:
void __flush_tlb_range(struct mm_struct *mm,
                              const struct cpumask *cmask,
                              unsigned long start, unsigned long size,
                              unsigned long stride)
void flush_tlb_all(void)

most of the information you exported with the tracepoints are just
parameters of flush_tlb_range.
So kprobe or function trace can also get most of them, while whether
local or not needs to calcuate the cmask, but getting this info is
also easy via. adding one LoC to the kprobe routine.

The tlb invalidation is frequently executed, so we need to carefully
evaluate the convience VS maitanince offort and performance overhead when
adding permanent tracepoints, given current riscv tracepoint overhead
isn't trivial.

BTW: whether SBI RFENCE or cross-cpu-call is much easier. Just search
IPI in /proc/interrupts. No need to kprobe/function trace/tracepoint

But we need to live with it. Per the Radim email, gcc14 can still
see the issue, given the minimum gcc version of kernel building
requirement is gcc8 now, gcc14 has a long time to bailout.

And another tricky point here is
one of your motivations of adding the tracepoint is to profile then
improve the tlb related code path performance, but adding the
tracepoint brings non-trivial overhead to tlb code path.
