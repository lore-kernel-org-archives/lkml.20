I'm just not sure how to actually do it right, because so many SoCs include that
feature. That is why I asked how you would do it having more insight as a
subsystem maintainer. It just looks incomplete to me. In the past I actually
verified it working with H2, H2+ and H3, none of them being
"allwinner,sun6i-a31-hwspinlock".
