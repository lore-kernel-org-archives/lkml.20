Sorry, ECAM blocker blocks both config and MMIO access, my bad.

That's true. But this is our best effort to avoid SError.

Yes, that's my understanding as well. And I believe SError won't happen if the
RC gets Unsupported Request (UR). SErrors are mostly associated with Completion
Timeouts and that will only happen if the PCIe link between the Switch
downstream port and Endpoint is still active and the Endpoint becomes inactive
(rare).

But if the Endpoint gets removed, then the link between the Port and the
Endpoint will go down and the Port will return Unsupported Request to the RC for
any read request.

Yes, that's the implementation issue in some ARM SoCs.

Last sentence needs correction. UR won't trigger SError, but only Completion
Timeouts will. So when a device connected to a PCIe switch gets removed, it
won't result in SError as long as the downstream port responds with UR.

But in the case of Qcom RPs, most of the time, Completion Timeouts are observed
when the CPU issues read to device whose link is down. That's why we need this
ECAM blocker feature to avoid it (not all the time though as you noted above,
but still better than nothing).
