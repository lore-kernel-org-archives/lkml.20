I don't understand what this comment is trying to say. The nested NMI is
confusing.

You are completely disabling stocks for memcg charges in nmi context. Why? I
assume that is what the comment above trying to explain but it is failing.

IIUC you want to use spin_lock instead of local_trylock because you want to
support draining from remote cpus and spin_lock on UP are simply disable irq and
does not protect from NMI. Maybe you need spin_trylock similar to local_trylock.
Not saying you to implement that but please explain stuff clearly.

migrate between cpus? Why? What are you gaining by allowing that?

Why do you need to disable irqs?

Anyways, you are changing the fast path of the charge drastically. Previously
there was no atomic ops and not irq toggling but this patch is adding atomic op
and irq toggle (not sure about why irq toggle is needed) on the fast path.

I understand that remote draining is the only reason you need to use spin locks
here otherwise you will need to allocate work_struct in page_counter_stock. You
are making these design decisions very silently and implicitly.

How about we decouple the decision of remote drain / spin lock from moving stock
inside page counter? First move the stock to page counter without any spin lock
or remote drain and later in the series you convert to spin lock plus remote
draining with performance numbers.
