I see, thanks for digging this up. Either way I think we want to keep
things consistent between here and nested_svm_check_permissions(). We
probably want a CPL check here, and it would be a superset of
X86_EFLAGS_VM as you mentioned. We probably wanna drop the CR0.PG
check from both places, and add an explicit X86_EFLAGS_VM check in
nested_svm_check_permissions() to #UD instead of #GP?
