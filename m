When asked to explain what I’m working on during hallway conversations, I usually
start with a top-down view:

“In order to support P2P in VMs, the virtual PCI topology needs to know whether
P2P is possible. However, the guest OS cannot see the physical topology because
it is hidden by the hypervisor. Since the VM and hypervisor run the same OS, we
need a generic way to report whether P2P is supported, rather than relying on a
CPU-supported whitelist. This is why we need ACPI HMAT [1].

However, HMAT alone is not enough: it is static and comes from firmware, the
BIOS, or the platform. We also need to account for ACS registers and different
traffic types.

This series provides the ACS, traffic piece of the puzzle.”

It is a fundamental building block (see my explanation above), but it is also
useful on its own. Even without VMs or HMAT, ACS and routing are important
(see the removed patch [2]): they allow us to dynamically enable or disable
ATS for each DMA mapping, support asymmetric PCI topologies, and more broadly
enable P2P by checking every PCI route.

This is why I didn't mention VM to the cover letter.

Right, the path and these bits are static.

This is equivalent to returning -EOPNOTSUPP when the functionality is
unavailable.

This means that this is regular DMA transfer which involves CPU.

I'm not sure the first part (return PCI_P2PDMA_MAP_NOT_SUPPORTED) is correct,
since callers have so far ensured that P2P is supported before calling this
function. The second part is correct.

PCI spec allows "A Function is permitted to intermix translated
and untranslated requests" and p2p doesn't decide anything except
if routing is possible or not.
