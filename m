Hi Leo,

Yes, that's exactly the approach in v5.

During write-protect, stage2_attr_walker() strips DBM from blocks (RO) 
but keeps it on level-3 pages (WC). After a block is split, the new 
level-3 pages are marked writable-clean. On the first write fault, 
relax_perms() upgrades the faulting page to writable-dirty.

So all three cases you listed are already covered:

- Blocks -> RO
- Pages -> WC
- Fault -> WD

Thanks,
Tian
