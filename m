Hi,

we have independently observed what appears to be the same NFSv4.1 
client hang against Microsoft Server for NFS, but with several important 
differences from the May 2026 report:

- the mounts are HARD, not soft
- sec=krb5 (RPCSEC_GSS), not AUTH_SYS
- observed on Linux 5.15 and Linux 6.8 clients
- Windows Server for NFS is from the Windows Server 2019 / build 17763 
family
- the trigger is strongly correlated with a Windows/NFS server restart, 
especially two rapid consecutive restarts during Windows servicing

Mount options:
   vers=4.1,rw,hard,timeo=1200,retrans=5,sec=krb5,proto=tcp

We currently have two affected clients preserved in the hung state.

Client A (Linux 5.15):
   nfsv4 SEQUENCE ... q:xprt_pending
   two nfsv4 GETATTR tasks ... q:ForeChannel Slot table

All of these use the same TCP transport to the Windows NFS server.

Client B (Linux 6.8):
   nfsv4 SEQUENCE ... q:xprt_pending

The NFS state-manager thread is blocked in:
   nfs4_drain_slot_tbl
   nfs4_reset_session
   nfs4_state_manager
   nfs4_run_state_manager

`lease_expired` continuously increases on the affected clients.

A 135-second tcpdump on Client B showed only TCP ACK packets between client
and server and no NFS RPC payload. The same SEQUENCE XID remained blocked on
q:xprt_pending before and after the capture.

Windows-side state at the same time:
- healthy Linux clients: TotalSessions=1 and an NFS session exists
- affected clients: the client record may still exist, but TotalSessions=0;
   Get-NfsSession and Get-NfsOpenFile return no objects
- one affected client is no longer listed by Get-NfsMountedClient at all,
   while the Linux client still waits on the stale local NFSv4.1 state

Historical correlation:
We have more than two independent incidents where the Windows NFS 
service/server was
restarted twice in rapid succession. In both cases one Linux client 
entered a
persistent abnormal NFS client state immediately afterwards. In the current
incident multiple Linux clients are affected while other clients recovered
normally.

This seems to indicate a client-side recovery deadlock: the server is 
back and
TCP is healthy, but the Linux client no longer sends useful NFS traffic 
because
a SEQUENCE/session slot never drains, and the state manager can wait 
indefinitely
in nfs4_drain_slot_tbl.

Questions:
1. Is there a known path where an outstanding NFSv4.1 SEQUENCE RPC can 
remain on
    xprt_pending while session recovery waits for the corresponding slot 
to drain?
2. Should nfs4_drain_slot_tbl be able to wait indefinitely in this 
situation?
3. When the server has lost the old session and is reachable again, 
should the
    client force teardown/recreation of the local session rather than 
waiting for
    the old slot forever?
4. Is there an existing patch or additional tracepoint/debug data that 
would be
    useful while we still have affected clients preserved in the hung state?

The May 2026 report appears closely related:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg6188959.html

We can provide the full SUNRPC debugfs output, mountstats, state-manager 
stacks,
Windows NFS session output, tcpdump, and timestamps of both server restart
incidents.

Regards,
Peter Schubert
