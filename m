Devres generally only works when all resources are device managed.
Therefore you should always provide the underlying non-devres manages
interface as well so that you don't force devres on drivers where it
could cause trouble.

We just discussed the renesas driver which can schedule rescan work
before registering the host controller. [1]

If such a driver also has non-devres managed resources that are freed
before the work is cancelled you have a use-after-free.

Yes, that looks wrong, but that's a separate issue.

I only pointed at greybus as an example of a driver which has non-devres
managed resources. If there is (rescan) work still scheduled after
probe() or remove() returns, there's a potential use-after-free.
