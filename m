can: peak_usb: validate channel numbers in PCAN-USB FD

The patch replaces the ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev) checks in the four
PCAN-USB FD decoders with a check against the adapter ctrl_count. It also
adds a NULL check on the usb_if->dev[] slot and returns -EINVAL instead
of -ENOMEM. Finally, it adds a loop to peak_usb_disconnect() that kills
all anchored RX URBs before any netdev is unregistered.

> This prevents potential out-of-bounds accesses when handling
> unexpected or corrupted messages received from PCAN-USB FD family
> devices.

[Severity: Low]
Is "out-of-bounds accesses" the right description? The commit in the
Fixes: tag (a6921dd524fe) already added ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev) checks to
all four decoders, so the index could not go past the array.

ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev) is PCAN_USB_MAX_CHANNEL, which is 2. The
pcan_usb_fd and pcan_usb_chip adapters use ctrl_count =
PCAN_USBFD_CHANNEL_COUNT, which is 1.

On those adapters a record with channel 1 passed the old check. It then
reached usb_if->dev[1], which is never assigned and so stays NULL from the
kzalloc. That NULL was dereferenced through dev->netdev or
container_of(dev, ...)->bec.

Would it be more accurate to describe this as a NULL pointer dereference?

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message only covers channel number validation in the PCAN-USB
FD decoders. Should this change to peak_usb_disconnect() go in its own
patch, or at least be described here?

peak_usb_disconnect() is the .disconnect callback of peak_usb_driver, so
this changes teardown for PCAN-USB, PCAN-USB Pro and all FD variants. The
Fixes: tag points at the range-check commit, which did not touch teardown
ordering.

It is also unclear which case the loop fixes. peak_usb_driver does not set
soft_unbind, so on a normal unbind the USB core already does this:

drivers/usb/core/driver.c:usb_unbind_interface() {
    ...
	if (!driver->soft_unbind || udev->state == USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED)
		usb_disable_interface(udev, intf, false);

	driver->disconnect(intf);
    ...
}

That call flushes all URBs on the interface before ->disconnect runs. As
far as I can tell, the new loop only changes behaviour when
peak_usb_probe() calls peak_usb_disconnect() directly after
peak_usb_create_dev() fails:

peak_usb_probe() {
    ...
		err = peak_usb_create_dev(peak_usb_adapter, intf, i);
		if (err) {
			/* deregister already created devices */
			peak_usb_disconnect(intf);
			break;
		}
    ...
}

> +	 */

[Severity: Medium]
Is this guarantee actually enforced? usb_kill_anchored_urbs() only blocks
resubmission while it is running.

The netdevs stay registered. PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED is only cleared per
device, inside the second loop, and no lock is held across the two loops.
So a concurrent open can re-arm the RX URBs after the drain:

peak_usb_ndo_open()
  peak_usb_start()
    usb_submit_urb()

On a normal unbind those submissions fail, because the interface has
already been disabled. On the peak_usb_probe() failure path the endpoints
are still enabled.

Take a two-channel FD adapter where creating channel 1 failed after
dev_init. usb_if->dev[1] still points at the freed channel 1 device (see
the comment in pcan_usb_fd_decode_canmsg() below).

Suppose can0 is brought up between the first loop and
unregister_candev(can0). Could a channel=1 record then be decoded through
the freed device?

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but when a decoder returns an
error like this one, peak_usb_read_bulk_callback() dumps the whole RX
buffer:

peak_usb_read_bulk_callback() {
    ...
			err = dev->adapter->dev_decode_buf(dev, urb);
			if (err)
				pcan_dump_mem("received usb message",
					      urb->transfer_buffer,
					      urb->transfer_buffer_length);
    ...
}

transfer_buffer_length is the allocated size, PCAN_UFD_RX_BUFFER_SIZE
(2048 bytes) for FD, not urb->actual_length. peak_usb_start() allocates
these buffers with a plain kmalloc().

Can a device send a short transfer with a bad channel number on the first
completion of each URB? If so, stale heap contents past actual_length
would go to the kernel log through print_hex_dump(KERN_INFO, ...).

The dump is not rate limited, and every ndo_open allocates new buffers.

Would dumping only urb->actual_length bytes be enough?

[Severity: High]
Does this check cover a channel whose device has already been freed?
Nothing ever clears usb_if->dev[]. The only writer is in
pcan_usb_fd_init():

	pdev->usb_if->dev[dev->ctrl_idx] = dev;

pcan_usb_fd_free() does nothing for a channel that still has siblings:

	if (!dev->prev_siblings && !dev->next_siblings) {

Consider probe of a two-channel FD adapter such as PCAN-USB Pro FD or X6:

peak_usb_create_dev(0)              can0 brought up, RX URBs live
peak_usb_create_dev(1)
  register_candev(can1)
  pcan_usb_fd_init()                dev[1] = dev1
  dev_set_bus(dev1, 0) fails        device stalls or times out
  adap_dev_free:
    pcan_usb_fd_free(dev1)          no-op, prev_siblings is set
  unregister_candev(can1)
  free_candev(can1)                 dev1 freed, dev[1] still set

Until peak_usb_probe() reaches peak_usb_disconnect(), a channel=1 record
on one of can0's URBs passes both the ctrl_count check and the !dev
check.

pcan_usb_fd_decode_error() then writes device-supplied counters into the
freed object:

	pdev->bec.txerr = er->tx_err_cnt;
	pdev->bec.rxerr = er->rx_err_cnt;

pcan_usb_fd_decode_canmsg(), pcan_usb_fd_decode_status() and
pcan_usb_fd_decode_overrun() read dev->netdev from freed memory and use
it.

Should the slot be cleared, and sibling RX quiesced, before a channel that
was already published to usb_if->dev[] is freed?

[Severity: Low]
The new NULL checks in pcan_usb_fd_decode_canmsg(),
pcan_usb_fd_decode_status(), pcan_usb_fd_decode_error() and
pcan_usb_fd_decode_overrun() target a sibling's RX completion that runs
while probe is publishing the slot in pcan_usb_fd_init().

Both sides use plain accesses: a plain store in process context and a
plain load in URB completion context. KCSAN would report this as a data
race.

Nothing orders the ctrlmode and ctrlmode_supported copies made in the
sibling branch of pcan_usb_fd_init() before the store either.
pcan_usb_fd_decode_canmsg() reads dev->can.ctrlmode.

The slot only ever goes from NULL to non-NULL, so the impact looks
limited. Should the store and loads use WRITE_ONCE()/smp_store_release()
and READ_ONCE()/smp_load_acquire()?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but peak_usb_create_dev() calls
register_candev() before dev->adapter->dev_init(). The FD netdev is
therefore visible to userspace before pcan_usb_fd_init() has set
pdev->usb_if, pdev->cmd_buffer_addr and usb_if->dev[].

A bitrate change in that window goes through peak_usb_set_bittiming() to
pcan_usb_fd_set_bittiming_slow(). That function writes through
pcan_usb_fd_cmd_buffer(dev) while it is still NULL. pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd()
also dereferences pdev->usb_if->fw_info.

This patch adds a small sub-window of its own. usb_if is kzalloc'ed and
published, and cmd_buffer_addr is allocated, before usb_if->adapter is
assigned here. Every decoder now starts by dereferencing
usb_if->adapter->ctrl_count.

That sub-window is very hard to hit, because decoding requires
PCAN_USB_STATE_STARTED. Before the patch, the same window crashed on the
NULL dev[] slot instead.

Could usb_if->adapter be assigned right after the kzalloc? The root fix
would be to finish dev_init before register_candev().

[ ... ]

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but it is in the same probe teardown code.
The error path in peak_usb_create_dev() frees the shared FD state before
the netdev is unregistered:

peak_usb_create_dev() {
    ...
adap_dev_free:
	if (dev->adapter->dev_free)
		dev->adapter->dev_free(dev);

lbl_unregister_candev:
	unregister_candev(netdev);
    ...
}

For channel 0 of any FD adapter, pcan_usb_fd_free() sees no siblings. It
kfree()s pdev->cmd_buffer_addr and pdev->usb_if and does not clear either
pointer.

If can0 was opened between register_candev() and the failing
dev_set_bus(dev, 0), unregister_candev() closes it:

unregister_candev()
  peak_usb_ndo_stop()
    pcan_usb_fd_stop()
      pcan_usb_fd_set_options()          writes freed cmd_buffer_addr
      pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count--   writes freed usb_if
    pcan_usb_fd_set_bus()                writes freed cmd_buffer_addr

pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd() also reads fw_info from the freed usb_if. Until
can0 is closed, its RX URBs keep decoding through the freed usb_if.

Should unregister_candev() run before dev_free here, in the same order
peak_usb_disconnect() uses?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the PCAN-USB Pro driver has
the same NULL slot dereference that this patch guards against in the FD
decoders. pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg() and pcan_usb_pro_handle_error() in
pcan_usb_pro.c only do this:

	if (ctrl_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev))
		return -EINVAL;

	dev = usb_if->dev[ctrl_idx];
	netdev = dev->netdev;

pcan_usb_pro_init() sets usb_if->dev[1] only when channel 1 is created. By
then can0 is already registered and can be opened, and its RX URBs are
live on the shared PCAN_USBPRO_EP_MSGIN endpoint.

The device can widen that window by delaying its responses to can0's
dev_set_bus(0) and dev_get_can_channel_id calls.

Can a record with ctrl_idx == 1 arriving in that window cause a NULL
pointer dereference in URB completion context? Should the Pro decoders get
the same NULL check?
