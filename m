Add the initial Kconfig and build-system plumbing for the Arm Core Local
Accelerator driver.

Introduce the common driver header and register definitions used by
later CLA support. The definitions cover the CLA MMIO frame, launch
response and status fields, standard accelerator registers, launch
opcodes, error codes and memory translation context state.

Add documentation describing the CLA programming model, its CPU-local
MMIO access rules, userspace assignment model, domain grouping and
expected boot state.

+Arm Core Local Accelerator (CLA)
+================================
+
+Arm CLA is an interface local to a CPU for programming accelerators that access
+memory via the CPU's MMU::

+                │ Caches and memory │
+                └───────────────────┘
+
+
+Hardware
+========
+
+The CLA supports up to 8 attached accelerators, which are accessed by
+programming the CLA's MMIO registers. Operations are launched to an accelerator
+and are polled for completion. CLA does not raise interrupts.
+
+::
+
+            CPU                     CLA              Accel
+             |--- write DATA[7:0] -->|                 |
+             |--- write LAUNCH ----->|---- launch ---->|
+             |<--- poll LRESP -------|                 |
+             |                       |                 |
+             |<--- poll STATUS ------|<--- complete ---|
+
+Each operation can take a 512-bit payload in the DATA registers. After handling
+a LAUNCH write, CLA indicates the launch status in the LRESP register. A further
+operation can only be launched after LRESP indicates completion of the previous
+launch.
+
+Some operations continue to run asynchronously on the accelerator after launch
+completion. In this case progress is tracked by polling the STATUS register.
+When the CLA updates the STATUS register, it also raises an event which will
+wake an in-progress WFE (wait for event) instruction on the local CPU.
+
+The CLA's MMIO registers are not accessible from remote CPUs. Although each CLA
+has a unique physical address, accesses from remote CPUs are read as zero and
+write ignored.
+
+The CLA registers are accessible from four different Privilege Level (PL)
+frames, with usage inteded to map to EL0 - EL3. The PLxCTRL registers may be
+written via a higher PL frame to suppress access to accelerators via a lower PL
+frame.
+
+The CPU and CLA share an MMU, although FEAT_TTCNP (common not private) is
+implemented, allowing both CPU and CLA to independently opt into and out of
+sharing TLB entries at runtime. TLB invalidation is performed via the CPU TLBI
+instructions; any TLBI instruction that targets the CLA's local CPU will also
+implicitly target the CLA.
+
+CLA has its own set of Memory Translation Context (MTC) registers, distinct from
+the CPU. A PL can set the MTC registers corresponding to an equivalent CPU
+Exception Level (EL) (eg. TCR_EL2 configurable only from the PL2 and PL3 MMIO
+frame).
+
+Faults during address translation are reported by the accelerator in its
+registers and in STATUS. While polling for work completion, software fixes up
+the faults and notifies the accelerator with RESOLVE operations.
+
+Accesses to the MMIO registers must be aligned 64-bit loads and stores, and the
+registers are mapped with Device-nGnRE attribute. Invalid accesses (unaligned,
+atomic, badly sized, etc) to the MMIO frame are either read as zero and write
+ignored, or cause a data abort, depending on the platform. Invalid access will
+never cause an SError.
+
+
+Inter-Accelerator Communication
+-------------------------------
+
+On some platforms, multiple accelerators, each attached to a separate CLA within
+a cluster, are also directly connected to each other via a shared bus to
+accelerate cooperation between accelerators. The accelerators sharing a bus
+cannot be isolated from each other. When collaborative operations are launched
+on each of the participating accelerators, they synchronize over the bus,
+stalling until all are ready.
+
+
+Intended SW Usage Model
+=======================
+
+CLA is designed for its PL0 MMIO frame to be mapped into user space and for user
+space to directly launch accelerator operations and poll for completion. It has
+been observed that for some use cases, the operation execution time is small and
+a trip through the kernel would consume a significant amount of the CPU budget
+for preparing the next operation leading to a significant reduction in bandwidth
+through the accelerator.
+
+User space software is expected to create a thread to drive each CLA it is
+using, and for each thread to be pinned to the CLA's local CPU.
+
+Software should rely on WFE (wait for event) to reduce power consumption when
+polling STATUS.
+
+The CLA is intended to be configured, by privileged software via PL1 and/or PL2,
+so that it shares virtual addresses with the process to which it is assigned
+(SVA). In practice this means configuring the CLA's MTC to point to the same
+page tables and use the same ASID (and VMID if relevant) as the process to which
+it is assigned. This ensures the architectural TLB invalidations also correctly
+target the CLA's TLB entries.
+
+We investigated the possibility of having the CLA driver allocate private page
+tables, private ASIDs/VMIDs and implement an MMU notifier for invalidation, but
+that suffers from 2 issues; there is a possibility of over-invalidation since
+the ASID and VMID spaces overlap with the CPU's (minor), and when issuing a
+TLBI, VMID is implicitly taken from CPU's VTTBR_EL2.VMID, which won't match the
+CLA's private VMID - therefore, for a virtualization scenario, TLB invalidation
+becomes impossible (major).
+
+Because the CLA has its own MTC registers, it is correct and safe for it to be
+executing an operation on behalf of user process A, while its local CPU is
+executing a thread from user process B.
+
+
+Difficulties for software to deal with
+--------------------------------------
+
+Although each CLA is attached to a single CPU, not all CPUs have a CLA, and CLAs
+may have a different set of accelerators attached. Users need to probe around to
+find a suitable accelerator and bind their process to it.
+
+Since remote CPUs can't access the CLA, dealing with CPU hotplug migrating tasks
+is challenging. And virtualization breaks down if the hypervisor cannot
+guarantee that a vCPU is pinned to a CPU.
+
+Saving and restoring the internal state of the accelerator is an optional
+feature. If an accelerator cannot preserve in-flight work, preempting it cancels
+that work. Software must carefully consider how to balance forward-progress
+guarantees with preemption latency.
+
+
+Driver
+======
+
+Booting
+-------
+
+A host expects to be booted with CLAs in the following state:
+
+- All attached accelerators have STATUS_IDLE set.
+- PL2CTRL: AVAIL all enabled for attached accelerators.
+  DBG at the firmware's discretion, preferably all enabled.
+- TSCTRLOWNER.PL, TSOFFOWNER.PL, PMUOWNER.PL all EL2.
+
+A guest expects to be booted with CLAs in the following state:
+
+- All attached accelerators have STATUS_IDLE set.
+- PL1CTRL: AVAIL all enabled for attached accelerators.
+  DBG at the hypervisor's discretion, preferably all enabled.
+
+Linux discovers the base address of each CLA device in the firmware tables and
+creates platform devices. cla_dev behaves mostly like a regular platform device,
+but it can only be accessed from one specific CPU. CPU hotplug notifiers probe
+and teardown the CLA device.
+
+CLAs may be grouped into domains. The topology is described in the firmware
+tables, and the driver creates cla_domain objects containing one or more
+cla_dev.
+
+
+Assignment to userspace
+-----------------------
+
+One char device per accelerator class provides enumeration and mmap abilities
+through ``/dev/cla/<class-id>``. Accelerators belong to the same class when
+their IIDR.IMPLEMENTER and IIDR.PRODUCTID register values match. ``<class-id>``
+is encoded as ``<IIDR.IMPLEMENTER:IIDR.PRODUCTID>``, each part using 3 hex
+digits. All class files enumerate all physical CLAs, with the same device IDs,
+domain IDs and mmap offsets. ``ARM_CLA_PARAM_DEV_ACCELS`` reports only the
+accelerator slots belonging to the opened class, and may be zero.
+
+The user task queries the driver to find a suitable set of CLAs, and mmaps their
+registers. For each mapped domain, the driver creates a cla_ctx context. When
+the user accesses the registers, the driver's fault handler queues the cla_ctx
+and waits for assignment. A context reassignment switches the whole cla_domain,
+by calling each CPU in the domain to switch the CLA context. A time slice is
+given to each context before being deassigned.
+
+In order to access the registers, the task must be bound to the CLA's CPU with
+sched_setaffinity(). Accesses from remote CPUs are ignored. If the CPU gets
+offlined, the task is migrated to an online CPU, and the driver disables the
+offlined CLA. User space may choose to use a mechanism such as restartable
+sequences to be notified when its task has been migrated away from its intended
+CLA.
+
+The accelerators access memory using the CPU's MMU. When assigning a context,
+the driver sets up the CLA's Memory Translation Context (MTC) with the page
+directory (TTBR), address space ID (ASID) and configuration (TCR) of the
+context's mm. When receiving translation faults from the accelerator, the user
+space task accesses the faulting address from the CPU to trigger the fault to be
+fixed up by the kernel before launching a RESOLVE operation to the accelerator.
+
+
+Power management
+----------------
+
+When a CPU enters a deep low-power state, then depending on the platform, the
+attached CLA and accelerators might not retain their state. In that case the
+firmware is expected to save the CLA and accelerator states before entering CPU
+low-power state, and restore them after exiting. The CLA driver does not expect
+to notice a CPU deep idle. However, if an accelerator does not support context
+saving, userspace will notice from the STATUS register that its work was
+canceled during deep idle. Given that userspace would be polling STATUS, the CPU
+is unlikely to enter deep idle while the CLA is running. To ensure
+forward-progress the admin can disable deep idle states (see
+Documentation/admin-guide/pm/cpuidle.rst).
