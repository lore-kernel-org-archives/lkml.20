So essentially tags of different (fixed) length live in different
namespaces.  Ok, that makes good sense to me, but wasn't initially
obvious to me.  So, I think we need to spell this out a bit better.

Right, now understanding your thoughts on the originally proposed
encoding, the "fixed" versus "variable" distinction makes more sense I
think.  I do see the advantage of never having a variable length
encoded within the tag word.

Right, so revising my suggestions in light of a better understanding
of what you had in mind originally, it comes down to:

 * I think adding more bits to the size field would be worthwhile to
   allow a wider variety of future fixed length metadata tags.

 * Originally I was thinking that having a length in bytes rather than
   just a length in 32-bit words would be worth it.  But thinking
   further, there's probably no benefit.  The length rounded up to
   32-bit words is all we need for skipping over it when unknown.
   Even if we want a fixed length tag with, say, 3 bytes of data, we
   can pad that out to a 1-word tag with a reserved byte.

Ok, so more length bits and better documentation of the fixed
vs. variable distinction are the only remaming suggestions.
