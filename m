This should be prevented by the following predicates:

1) Realms only support guest_memfd backed memslots for mappable memory.
2) Memslots cannot be created after the Realm is created, as is with the
protected VMs. (This check seems to have been lost over the iterations,
  but should be reinstated).

The Realm mem abort code should prevent this by ensuring that the
memslot is backed by gmem for private_faults. With the mandate of
in-place conversion, even the shared pages must come from the
gmem backed memslots.

Agreed. I will address these concerns in the kvm part2 of the CCA changes.
