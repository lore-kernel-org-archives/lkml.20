But that's a driver imposed timeout, and it sounds rather arbitrary (and 
bad). How quickly does the firmware usually reply? What would be the 
situation where the firmware takes e.g. 1.5s to reply? I would guess 
that if the FW updates the KEEP_ALIVE_p every N us, it would also reply 
to us in that time.

In any case, changing MAILBOX_TIMEOUT_US would be another patch. 
KEEP_ALIVE_p sounds fine if you know how often the FW updates it.
