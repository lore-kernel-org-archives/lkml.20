Oooh, actual hotplug of vCPUs.  That makes sense.

It's not disallowed, just unusual, obviously.

Gah, foiled by my own documentation.  I had this wrong in my head.  It's no=

aliasing logic that matters, it's literally the behavior of the optimized m=

I was documenting.

Yeah, ignore that.

Backing up a step, what exactly is the problem you're trying to solve?  Bec=
ause
I suspect there's no solution that will magically fix everything.  E.g. if =
you're
trying to resolve an issue where vCPUs aren't recognizing SIPIs, then the e=
xample
you provided means vCPU_531 will never wakeup, i.e. which vCPU is  "buggy" =
changes,
but the bug itself is still there.

If this is about SIPIs hitting the all CPUs, then I think to have a robust =
(well,
as robust as this mess can get) implementation, we'd have to disable use of=
 the
optimized map when processing SIPIs with PHYSICAL delivery, e.g.
