Ah, I understand your point. I was assuming that the driver could later
be detached after uniphier_uart_resume() failed, leaving the clock disabled.

If that sequence cannot happen after a failed system resume, then my concern
doesn't apply. Thanks for pointing this out.

In that case, I have no further concerns about the use of
devm_clk_get_enabled() here.

Thank you,
