My bot found errors running 'make dt_binding_check' on your patch:

yamllint warnings/errors:

dtschema/dtc warnings/errors:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/boot-logo-clut224.example.dtb: chosen: 'logo' does not match any of the regexes: '^framebuffer', '^pinctrl-[0-9]+$'
	from schema $id: http://devicetree.org/schemas/chosen.yaml

doc reference errors (make refcheckdocs):

See https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/devicetree/patch/20260923201035.51007-3-maximpedraza@gmail.com

The base for the series is generally the latest rc1. A different dependency
should be noted in *this* patch.

If you already ran 'make dt_binding_check' and didn't see the above
error(s), then make sure 'yamllint' is installed and dt-schema is up to
date:

pip3 install dtschema --upgrade

Please check and re-submit after running the above command yourself. Note
that DT_SCHEMA_FILES can be set to your schema file to speed up checking
your schema. However, it must be unset to test all examples with your schema.
