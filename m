The driver implements device_pause/device_resume, but device_tx_status
keeps reporting DMA_IN_PROGRESS for a paused channel, so clients cannot
tell a paused channel apart from a running one. Report DMA_PAUSED when
the channel is paused and the cookie is still in flight, including for
callers that pass a NULL dma_tx_state, and clear the stale is_paused
flag in dma_chan_terminate_all(), which disables the channel and thus
implicitly cancels the paused state.

Also, the residue of an in-flight transfer is currently derived from
the number of completed LLI blocks, so it only advances in block-size
steps and stays stale for the duration of a large block. Read the
current hardware pointer (CH_SAR for MEM_TO_DEV and MEM_TO_MEM, CH_DAR
for DEV_TO_MEM) and walk the descriptor's LLIs to compute how many
bytes have actually been transferred. The 64-bit pointer is sampled
with a tearing-safe double read, as the transfer may be running
concurrently. The pointer is only consulted for the descriptor most
recently programmed into the hardware, tracked in the previously
unused chan->desc field; any other descriptor has not been started yet
and keeps reporting its full length. When the transfer has just
completed but the descriptor has not been reaped yet, the pointer sits
at the end of the last block and the residue naturally reads as 0;
conversely, a channel whose enable bit is still set never reports full
completion, so a stale pointer left by a previous transfer reusing the
same buffer cannot be mistaken for a finished one. Cyclic descriptors
keep the block-granular accounting.

Tested on an FPGA platform.

Changes in v4:
- Track which descriptor the hardware pointer registers belong to via
  the (previously unused) chan->desc field instead of testing the head
  of desc_issued: a queued-but-never-started descriptor must not be
  matched against the stale pointer left by a previous transfer, which
  could otherwise falsely report full completion when its buffer is
  reused.
- Clear chan->desc when its descriptor is reaped or the channel is
  terminated.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20260923044104.3234-1-wr574332525@163.com/
Changes in v3:
- Report DMA_PAUSED also to callers passing a NULL dma_tx_state.
- Never report full completion while the channel enable bit is still
  set, so a stale pointer (e.g. a new transfer reusing the buffer of a
  just-finished one) is not mistaken for completion.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20260923034653.1413-1-wr574332525@163.com/
Changes in v2:
- Sample the 64-bit SAR/DAR with a tearing-safe double read instead of
  lo_hi_readq(), avoiding a torn pointer when the low half wraps.
- Read the hardware pointer for the in-flight descriptor even after the
  hardware has just completed it (channel enable self-cleared, IRQ not
  yet handled), so the residue reads 0 instead of jumping back to the
  full length.
