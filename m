The M62's vendor controls are driven by hid-topping-m62, added in the
previous patch, which speaks a vendor protocol on the card's HID
interface. Those controls belong on the sound card that plays the
audio, not on a card of the HID driver's own.

This adds the other half of that: a component master, registered from
the M62's mixer quirk, which hands its struct snd_card to the HID
driver at bind time and takes the controls away again at unbind. The
lifetime rules are the component framework's, which is the point --
neither driver has to be told about the other's disconnect, and neither
has to guess at the other's state. The same shape binds HD-audio to the
graphics drivers in sound/hda/core/component.c, with sound as the
master there too.

The master's context lives in devres on the audio control interface
rather than in drvdata, which on a usb_interface belongs to
snd-usb-audio itself; devres_find(), keyed on the release function,
gives it back inside the callbacks, which are handed nothing but a
struct device *. It hangs off the control interface rather than off the
USB device because component_match_add() allocates the match list with
devm: on the interface that is released at unbind, while on the
usb_device it would live until the device itself was released and a
rebind would stack a second list on top.

Neither component_compare_dev() nor component_compare_dev_name() fits:
the audio side has no pointer to the HID device, and the HID device's
name carries an instance counter that is not predictable. The match is
therefore one of descent -- the HID device sits two levels below the
USB device -- and which interface it is stays the HID driver's
business, since it registers a component for the vendor interface and
for no other. That keeps sound/usb free of HID symbols and of any
opinion about this card's interface numbering.

component_master_add_with_match() returns 0 with the aggregate merely
pending when the HID driver is absent, so the card comes up either way
and grows the vendor controls if and when the other half appears.
