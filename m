I was hoping that we could get this into the next merge window, but as we are
approach rc6 and I didn't even manage to review all patches (shame on me), I
assume this would be a quite fit.

So I assume this series is one of the things that we'll try to get in shape over
the next merge window to queue it early after rc1.
