For the record, the CONDITIONAL ones are required for self-describing
cases for L1_GPT_CREATE and TRACKING_GRANULE_SET, where the RMM could
accept DELEGATED granules for the objects (if not self describing) or
UNDELEGATED granules  (if they are self-describing).

For now, we don't support such RMMs, so will reject the type for now.
