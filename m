OK. So I fully agree that foreign dirty tracking and flushing is very
rough. The basic premise of that infrastructure is that foreign dirtying
should be very rare and amount of foreign dirty pages very low and thus
largely irrelevant for the dirty throttling. The flushing is there mostly
as a last resort solution to have a chance of *some* kind of forward
progress in corner cases where the amount of foreign dirty pages is
substantial.

As Tejun wrote [1], bdev inodes are kind of breaking these assumptions.
Still number of dirty pages there should be low compared to data pages but
for some workloads that isn't necessarily the case.

If you look at the logic in writeback_sb_inodes(), it actually goes to
great lengths to avoid the fairness issues you describe above. We only
write a limited amount of pages from each inode (see
writeback_chunk_size()), then we switch to another one, cycling through all
inodes queued to b_io list in this way. Inodes on b_io list get fixed when
the writeback work starts (see queue_io()) so new inodes cannot appear
there. This is not bulletproof but it avoids the practical livelocking
cases. So generally I don't expect your systems have practical issues with
foreign flushes not really flushing what they should.

As I wrote above, at this point I'm not convinced concurrent dirtying is
your practical problem. If you can show foreign flushes in your real
workloads often don't end up flushing what they should, then we can discuss
how to improve the writeback behavior (or foreign flush behavior) to avoid
that.
