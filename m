Most findings will hold for multiple models across different years
as asus reuses a lot of code for the same lineup. Thankfully!

Fair enough.

Does this laptop have other lights? I wonder what that is changing...

I have a cursed TUF that does the same and looks correct and yet it
doesn't sleep in linux... Someday I will understand what's going on
with that. Thankfully it's not the case here as the sleep residency
is high for you.

Wow... okay... so it was actually designed this way.

Probably because the idea is that "keyboard lit" = "ready to go"/"press a key to resume".

Could be that they simply leave it on as said above.

Doesn't look like something to be investigated further, perhaps try to see
if there is some unknown devid in wmi that does something cool.

in the OGC discord (ex asus-linux discord, you find it on our website) people
are planning a GUI redesign, perhaps if you have spare time you can add an option
to asusd to shutdown leds when entering sleep to have a GUI on a widely used tool
but I think this is time consuming enough that is probably not worth unless you find
it funny to do.
