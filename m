Hi all,

Thanks for the feedback and the discussion. The device_name ->
iommu_group -> sid mapping shown in the patch[1] is only one
configuration example. It may not fully exploit MPAM capabilities,
especially when multiple devices share the same iommu_group.

There are other possible configuration approaches, for example deriving
the SID directly from the PCIe BDF. I prefer to use the device directly
  rather than iommu_group, as that is more aligned with the MPAM
specification. I also agree that iommu_group is not ideal as a new uAPI,
for the reasons Jason and others have pointed out.

However, there are two problems with using the device directly:

Not all devices can obtain their SID via a device name in the same way
PCIe devices can.

MPAM actually supports SSID-granularity control and monitoring, but
users currently cannot obtain the SSID.
