Thanks for your sharing with deliberate thought.

Agreed, and I want to be clear that the size knob is my implementation
choice, not something the design needs.

Now in v2, xswap's create() already takes no size, only an optional
priority: the device's address space is set by the kernel to the machine's
memory and cluster_info is mapped lazily, so nothing is allocated up front.
The only knob left is an optional per-device ceiling. If we really want to
remove it, that's quite easy thing, we can just remove the runtime
growth ceiling and the shrink machinery that serves it.

When I asked why shrink is needed, Nhat told on system, memory pressure
could reach a peak, than later may not reach it again for a long time. I
don't like the continuous automatic growing/shrinking, I think it
doesn't make much sense just for saving that memory serving struct
swap_cluster_info. But it's not bad to provide a mechanism for
admin/users to tune it.

But as I said, xswap/vswap both claim to solve the problem of zswap
physical disk slot and swap slot coupling, and meantime extend
functionality to make it more flexible than zswap/zram. While Nhat's
vswap is boot-time per-device swap. And Nhat's own description of it
in this thread is "vswap is just a normal swap device, no?". If I didn't
apply Nhat's code and test I couldn't realize it. I executed swapon but
can't see any output. I was shocked.

I really appreciated your patient and detailed sharing, while it takes
you so long words to explain it. IMHO, it deserves a separate patch
posting to justify it so that anyone can know why it is.

Thanks
Baoquan
