Hi Neil, Maxime, Benjamin, and others,

I've been following the patch set over the past couple of days, mostly
out of curiosity. You folks understand the details of your subsystem
best, therefore I trust you with that, but I've seen a lot of
misunderstandings which feed into unjustified worries about how some
of this will work.

For clarity, as several people have already pointed out:
1) BPF programs ship with complete bytecode and line information from
the source, so I don't think the concern about the program being a
binary blob is justified in any sense. The verifier has to verify it
after all, before it gets loaded into the kernel. They also must be
licensed as GPL to have access to any kernel functionality.
2) Adding BPF interfaces does not lock the kernel side ABI into a
perpetual stability contract. There have been several thriving
communities (sched_ext, HID-BPF) which have used BPF successfully in
practice and have never had to make suboptimal technical choices
because they support BPF-based customization. The interfaces have
changed and in some cases completely rewritten without breaking users.
Of course, you might decide to be less or more graceful w.r.t.
backwards compatibility, but this is a choice left in the hands of
subsystem maintainers.
3) On top of all this, there are several mechanisms in BPF programs to
detect availability of APIs and adapt it during load to allow programs
to work across kernel versions, both for functions the program can
call and data it can access.

As far as people being able to carry downstream changes, I think, at
this point, that is already trivial with or without BPF (esp. with
LLMs), the only thing you change is how easy it is for users to avoid
being tied to kernel release cycles.

With the right incentives people will end up sharing their BPF
programs with the rest of the community. sched_ext and HID-BPF are two
strong examples of this. All programs get developed in the open with
community involvement, even when several companies make use of them
internally for their production use cases. The theoretical worries are
fine, but as far as practical evidence goes it has worked out
positively for everyone involved (not once, but twice).

The only valid concern I saw was the dependency on user space to load
these programs. We have had a bpf_preload mechanism in the tree since
forever, it has not found much traction since existing use cases
didn't often need the ability to load programs early. We'd be happy to
explore how it could be adjusted, or reworked to better support
whatever requirements emerge from this work.

In any case, I am not equipped to decide what is best for your
subsystem, but at least from the BPF side, I saw several
misconceptions which I hope the above can address.

Thanks
