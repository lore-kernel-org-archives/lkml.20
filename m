The root cause is that the journal was intentionally corrupted to
make an empty journal appear full. The normal mechanisms to free
journal space for transaction reservations or return space after
recovery don't work because -there is nothing to free-. V5
filesystems detect this specific issues and error out; v4
filesystems only warn.

IOWs, this hang has nothing to do with transaction reservation or
log sizes, and everything to do with passing the filesystem a
carefully crafted image with corrupted index values that will never
actually happen in the real world....

Deeds speak louder than words. If you want it fixed, fix it and
propose the fix for inclusion.

As I said in 2018 about this specific v4 fuzzer "issue":

| And this comes back to my repeated comments about fuzzers needing

| things like this. Fuzzing random collections of v4 filesystem

| about fuzzing filesystems and reproducing bugs that are meaningful
| and useful to us.

It should be pretty obvious that in 2018 we weren't fixing this sort
of stuff in v4 filesystems because the default v5 format catches
them and errors out correctly.

Now it's 2026, v4 format is officially deprecated, we don't build v4
support by default, and V4 support is officially going to be removed
in 2030. We're not going to fix this.

I welcome your 2028 report. You'll get the same answer.
