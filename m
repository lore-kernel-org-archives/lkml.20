Thanks, Josef.

Would you mind describing what other solutions you considered?  I've been
looking over this set since Tuesday, and finding it hard to reason about.
(Part of that is certainly the nature of the problem, and it's possible
that this is the best/simplest solution.)

If we replaced the userns->parent_could_setfcap bool with a ref to the
creator's cred, then at both setns and write we could check the actor's
credentials, right?  There are probably issues with that specific idea,
but that's why it would be good to see what else you've considered.

Of course UID 0 will always continue to carry privileges even with an
empty cap_eff.  Here we're stopping it from writing filecaps to uid 0
owned files, but if it can open a 0 owned file on the host, like
/bin/sh or a systemd init file, or ptrace a process (in a child ns that
maps parent uid 0) doing so, it can still cause damage.  My point being,
we do need to keep in mind the tradeoff of keeping the code simple
versus the realistic threat of the problem being addressed.
