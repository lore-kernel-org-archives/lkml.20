From: Luka Gejak <luka.gejak@linux.dev>

The RTL8723BS reports free TX page counts that the generic 8051 path
reads back from the chip on every transfer, which is both slow over SDIO
and unreliable on this part: the register frequently reads back zero
while pages are in fact available. It also gates transmission on a free
count in the SDIO output queue, REG_SDIO_OQT_FREE_PG, which rtw88 does
not track at all. The vendor driver calls this the OQT free space and
never expands the acronym; the register holds the number of further
transfers the SDIO output queue can accept, and the chip discards
writes that arrive when it has run out.

Mirror the vendor driver and keep the per-queue and public page counts
in software, seeded at start and resynchronised from the chip only when
the cached counts say there is not enough room. Wait for a free output
queue entry before writing, and account for the pages consumed after a
successful transfer.

The check, the output queue wait and the accounting are serialised by
a mutex. The TX worker and the H2C path reach this function
concurrently, and two writers that both pass the checks can otherwise
claim the same pages and output queue entry, after which the chip
silently discards whichever transfer arrives second. The vendor driver
avoids the same race by funnelling all transmission through one thread.

Measured on RTL8723BS hardware against an iperf3 server one hop behind
the AP, with the wlan0 byte counters as ground truth. On the generic
path the association completes but no data passes at all: TCP and UDP
both measure 0 bit/s in either direction. With this patch TCP is
25.3 Mbit/s up and 37.3 Mbit/s down, and UDP is 25.0 Mbit/s up at 0%
loss.

Notes:
    Changes in v10:
      - the transfer size comes from sdio_align_size() now. On this card,
        which reports multi block support and a 512 byte block size, it is
        identical to the open coded rounding: checked at the block
        boundaries and then against every frame of a session, 80000 frames
        with no difference.
      - the block padding is gone from this patch. Measured on hardware it
        is not something the chip needs. Transferring unpadded, exactly as
        the generic path does, gives 20.9 to 21.1 Mbit/s uplink against
        19.5 to 19.8 padded, with scans, reconnection and a UDP flood clean
        either way. What the padding really fixes is that the aligned
        length is read from past the end of the frame, which every SDIO
        part does today, so it is a separate fix and not part of this
        patch.
      - dropped the comment above rtw_sdio_write_port_8723bs() and trimmed
        the ones on the page counters.
    Changes in v9:
      - rtw_sdio_write_port() is now only a dispatcher, with the two paths in
        rtw_sdio_write_port_8723bs() and rtw_sdio_write_port_generic(), as
        you asked. The chip specific one takes the mutex with guard()
        directly, so the extra rtw_sdio_8723bs_write_port() layer, which only
        existed to give the guard a scope while the generic path shared the
        outer function, is gone.
      - the unaligned SKB warning is in rtw_sdio_write_to_port() now, once,
        next to the transfer whose pointer it checks and after any padding.
        __func__ therefore reads rtw_sdio_write_to_port on every SDIO part.
    Changes in v8:
      - RTW_TX_QUEUE_VO is accounted against the normal page pool rather than
        the high one. rtw_sdio_get_tx_addr() writes it to the normal transmit
        FIFO, and that is the pool the chip charges: over a saturating VO
        flood the high pool never lost a single page while the public pool
        drained. The vendor maps VO to the high queue, but it also writes VO
        to the high FIFO, which rtw88 does not.
      - the output queue entry claimed before the transfer is handed back
        when the transfer fails, rather than staying claimed until the cache
        next resyncs from the chip.
      - mutex_destroy() for tx_credit_lock on teardown and on the init error
        path, matching rtw_core_deinit().
      - the comment on the cached page counters no longer explains the
        atomic_t by the several contexts that write them. Since v7 the
        transmit paths all update them under tx_credit_lock; what is left
        outside the lock is rtw_sdio_start() seeding them, and that is the
        reason they stay atomic_t.
      - the free page check, the output queue wait, the transfer and the
        accounting moved into rtw_sdio_8723bs_write_port(), which takes the
        lock with guard(mutex) as you suggested. The generic path is a short
        branch in rtw_sdio_write_port() that never touches the lock, and the
        transfer itself is shared as rtw_sdio_write_to_port().
      - lockdep_assert_held() added to rtw_sdio_8723bs_write_port(),
        rtw_sdio_8723bs_wait_tx_oqt() and rtw_sdio_8723bs_consume_txpg(),
        and checked on a kernel built with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING over
        bidirectional traffic and three module reloads: nothing fired.
      - the padding uses a pad_size local and the comment is down to the one
        point that matters, that __skb_pad() must not free the skb.
      - the comment above the lock is gone; the one at the declaration of
        tx_credit_lock covers it.
    Changes in v7:
      - the free page check, the output queue wait and the accounting after
        the transfer are serialised by a mutex. The TX worker and the H2C
        path run concurrently, and two writers that both passed the checks
        could claim the same pages and output queue entry; the OQT refill
        could also read the register while the other writer was between its
        claim and its transfer. The chip silently discards the overcommitted
        transfer, which for H2C means a lost firmware command.
      - the CMD53 address is computed from skb->len again, as upstream does.
        Passing the aligned size changed the encoded transfer length for
        every other SDIO chip whenever sdio_align_size() padded; for the
        RTL8723BS the two encodings are the same value.
      - the padding is applied with __skb_pad() and only on the RTL8723BS
        path. The open coded version wrote into a cloned skb's shared buffer
        when the tailroom happened to be large enough, and it also ran on
        the generic path, giving other chips a new allocation and failure
        mode. __skb_pad() does not move skb->len, so the trim on the way out
        is gone too. It must not free the skb on failure, since one caller
        requeues it and the other frees it.
    
    Changes in v6: none.
    Changes in v5:
      - the commit message now says what OQT is, as far as the vendor driver
        reveals it.
      - rtw_sdio_8723bs_sync_free_txpg() returns whether the chip reported
        anything and is the only caller of _store_free_txpg(), and
        _init_free_txpg() returns an error rather than nothing. That found a
        real bug: the public pool size was acq_pg_num minus the reserved
        queues with no check, so a chip coming up with no transmit page
        allocation would underflow a u16 and leave about 65000 free pages.
        It is now rtw_sdio_8723bs_pubq_num(), shared with the queue page
        allocation repair path, and it fails cleanly.
      - the output queue wait is bounded by a jiffies deadline rather than a
        loop count, so RTW_SDIO_OQT_TIMEOUT_MS is really milliseconds.
      - rtw_sdio_8723bs_check_rqpn() returns an error instead of silently
        doing nothing when the pool cannot cover the reserved queues, and
        rtw_sdio_start() propagates it. Both early returns are explained.
