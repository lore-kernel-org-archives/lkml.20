That's good! The probe function is unfortunately a bit chaotic as it
is already... After all this driver must handle many different wildly
different devices so keeping it simpler benefits the addition of new
devices.

Well you know how this things go... Only who does nothing can claim
to have made no mistakes. There's no problem for me, in fact it happened
to me too to do work based on assumptions that ended up being false...
It just happens and is nobody's fault!

I actually like reading these things so I know what was done and tested
and what to look for in case I find myself in similar situations (and what
to look for when bringing up new hardware in the fastest way possible).

I haven't looked much at these models beside the wmi side so I don't
know if they are like ROGs/TUFs but ROGs and TUFs have the keyboard
backlight that can be configured in s2idle and/or hibernation, but even
if powered on usually the pattern changes... So I am concerned that
hardware isn't entering s2idle properly... Are you sure it is?

You can use the amd-s2idle tool even if the CPU is an intel one to check
that.

I don't want to speculate too much, but if it really is sleeping then we are
either missing a way to configure backlight enablement on power states
or a command to send while suspending.
