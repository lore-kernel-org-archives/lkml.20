Please don't.  I've added dso__dbginfo_type() to handle debug files and
that's the correct way to get the file.  Probably dso__debuginfo() would
work for you.

I was working on cleaning up this area, but sidetracked by other things.
I hope to find time for it soon but you can go with the above helpers.

Thanks,
Namhyung
