I'm not sure if that was a question, but I don't think it would matter eith=
er
way. If RV generates it's own events, these exist even before the monitor r=
uns
(just like bpf_printk) so it doesn't really matter when ftrace attaches to =
them.

By the way, there are other occurrences in the kernel, apparently used only=

Yes, that's actually what standard RV has always been doing, I've never not=
iced
dropped tracepoints.
I thought bpf_printk used some shared buffers or some other things on top o=
f
that but it doesn't seem to have anything but a tracepoint string.

Fair enough, I feel to be cautious at redefining what reactors are right no=
w,
though. Currently they are nothing but a function call to the set-up action=
.
It's trivial to verify where the code goes without adding the tracing subsy=
stem
as a dependency in the path (typically important in some safety critical ca=
ses).
Sure, handlers are called by the same tracing subsystem nonetheless, so it =
may
not add much value.

Let's leave reactors aside for a moment. What I am coming to terms with,
instead, is that the current ringbuffer to userspace design isn't what we w=
ant.
In kernel monitors communicate their status through tracepoints, perfectly
integrating to tracing tools, BPF monitors use a custom buffer.

Generating a tracepoint here is probably the way to go. bpf_printk does gen=
erate
one, but as Tomas pointed out, hijacking that for everything (think of moni=
tor
events) might be a bit much.
Nonetheless, we want RV BPF handlers to generate tracepoints, then attachin=
g
actions on error tracepoints (whether we call that reactors or not) can be =
done
later.

Summarising, we have 2 potential designs.

1. bpf_printk only:
  bpf_printk("event: monitor: curr_state x event -> next_state")
  bpf_printk("error: monitor: event not expected in curr_state")

2. new kfunc(s) calling a tracepoint:=20
  trace_event_da_bpf("monitor", "curr_state", "event", "next_state")
  trace_error_da_bpf("monitor", "curr_state", "event")

1. is simpler and works mostly out of the box, depending on how powerful gl=
ob
filters are, it can reach the same functionality as 2. Might risk to overlo=
ad
the shared bpf_printk event and perhaps have a higher filtering overhead.
2. is closest to the current in-kernel implementation and offers flexibilit=
y to
easily filter the type of event (useful for DA, e.g. I want a backtrace onl=
y
when going from state A to B). But it requires a series of kfuncs (e.g. err=
or
and event for each monitor class).

In both cases a malicious actor could call the kfunc and make us believe th=
ere
was a reaction (they cannot mess with the model though). If we own the kfun=
cs we
can at least limit the availability (tracing-only and CAP_SYS_BOOT).
This, unless we register BPF monitors in the kernel like in V1.

I'm going to test each design once I get again to work on this.

Thoughts?
