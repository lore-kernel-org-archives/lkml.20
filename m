Ha, I also noticed this issue in the buffer_head path when I was adding
the iomap path earlier. I was planned to start addressing the generic
bio completion converting work across both writeback paths after the
current stage of work wraps up, so thanks for fixing this one separately!

Yes, Jan discussed this optimization direction with me previously. Next,
I'll try to remove ext4's own deferred workqueue and migrate the work
into the generic flow.

Thanks,
