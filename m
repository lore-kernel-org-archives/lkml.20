In general in mm and mm-adjacent we prefer not. I think this might vary by
subsystem, but it gets buried easily in even single patches, so best to default
to not I think.

OK appreciated!

Ack, this seems to be a trend. And obviously we're not against LLM usage, as I'm
sure you're aware, this is about rate-limiting that's all.

Also use of lean seems like a nice way of bounding LLMs in a way that makes them
less likely to go awry, I didn't know people were already using that for the
kernel, so that's interesting!

In general the bug reports are welcome, just space them out a bit, or if you
have a bunch for a subsystem, contact maintainers ahead of time.

I know you've generally only sent a few-per-subsystem, but in general this is
about managing workload.

Right now the biggest issue with AI submissions is volume-of-submission
vs. review resource. The former can grow exponentially, the latter very much not
:)
