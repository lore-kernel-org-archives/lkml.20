Right.

This is what I wanted to fix in my earlier attempt.

Ok.

Can you please do this in a separate patch?  I think it's better to
minimize the patch and focus on the core changes.

Ok, but also can be done in a separate patch.

Sounds like it should be done with step 2 above.

Can be a separate change as well.

Right, it's confusing that we have both --filter-pids and -p.

What's the benefit to users of disabling syscall augmentation?  Is it
only for debugging?  Anyway, I think this should be added as a separate
patch.

It'd be great if you can shorten the commit message..
