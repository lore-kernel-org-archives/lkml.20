If you agree to having mmap() go through guest_memfd, then read() and
write() should also go through guest_memfd imo. I think it makes sense
since guest_memfd gates accesses based on shared/private status.

guest_memfd already had plans to support write() [4], so I think
supporting read() should be fine too.

I'm not super familiar with ioeventfd, let me know if this makes sense:
ioeventfd is a kind of config, like mmap() is a config, but faulting is
where the actual access can happen.

guest_memfd always allows mmap(), but only allows faults on shared
offset ranges.

If userspace sets up some link between a private range and some eventfd,
I think that's ok, since it's not actually doing accesses. When the
signalling actually happens, then guest_memfd needs to gate that.

Going by that, I think if the ioeventfd ioctls are just setting up
links/mapping, then it can go through the VFIO fd.

Between going via the VFIO fd and guest_memfd, I think if "everything is
wrapped by guest_memfd" a simpler mental model to go with, then maybe we
could just go with swapping the entire f_ops with guest_memfd's
intercepted version?


IIUC during the LPC discussion some people were suggesting creating a
brand-new only-for-guest-memfd resource fd and not relying on existing
mount fds or VFIO fds. What do you think of that? Instead of using the
existing VFIO fd, would it be better to create a new for-gmem-to-wrap
VFIO fd? I didn't like the idea of needing to create a new kind of fd
for every resource guest_memfd needs to wrap.

Yes please, gmem_provider_ops in my RFC was just a minimal set, we can
expand that as providers require.

Imo we should have either gmem_provider_ops in some ops
(super_operations or file_operations or elsewhere), or a registration
model for all of gmem_provider_ops, but not a mixture of global vs
registration.

I see, so infrequent == once ever? Could the guest want to, at runtime,
switch some BARs between shared/private? I wonder if the spec supports
runtime conversions.

I was hoping blocking conversion could make the implementation simpler
if we never need to convert at runtime. It might be easier to merge if
we trim the features. :) It's also nice to have consistency with regular
guest RAM though.

Did you mean to just block mmap() access completely from userspace on a
gmem-wrapped-vfio-fd?

If the CoCo guest and device allows some BAR to be shared, I was
assuming that's because the host might need to take some action on those
ranges. If so, then mmap() would be one way to access those ranges (in
addition to read()/write()). I think we should still support faulting
into userspace page tables for shared ranges from a
gmem-wrapped-vfio-fd, and ideally follow the same model as regular
guest_memfd where mmap() is always allowed, but not faulting for
CoCo-private offset ranges.

I see, thanks for explaining! This is one thing different private BARs,
that private BARs cannot be faulted into stage 2 at runtime.

With Confidential IO, private BARs don't support fault handling, do
shared BARs support fault handling?
