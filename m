Hi Jiayuan

You are right on the technical side, and your patch was correct
from an RFC point of view. The old behavior was a side effect,
not a designed mechanism, and the reporter setup only works
because the masquerading relay keeps the exception fresh.

But it did work for them, for years, and it stopped working after
a stable update. That is the part we have to fix first, even if the
setup relies on an accident. MSS clamping on the relay is the proper
long term answer for them.

This is partly my fault: I reviewed the patch and did not object to
the Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 + Cc: stable tags. A behavior change like this
one should have stayed in net-next.

I think we mus take the revert in net as well, so that
mainline and stable trees behave the same, and the stable
backports do not diverge.

Then a net-next patch is welcome, keeping the historical behavior
as the default. Before adding a new sysctl, please check if the
existing per-route advmss metric is enough for the DSR case,
as Esko showed in the changelog. If it is not (for instance because
it is too hard to deploy on many routes), a sysctl sounds fine to me.

Thanks!
