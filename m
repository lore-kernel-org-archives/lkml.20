With all due respect, you've already said that you don't have any hardware
that uses the sata_dwc_460ex driver.

So you have not encountered a problem in the real world, and you have not
been able to test that your LLM-assisted patch solves that real world
problem.

The risk of accepting LLM-assisted patches for problems that no one has
been able to reproduce on real hardware, is that the fix itself might
introduce another problem, and then we just trade one problem for another.

AFAICT, this seems to have been the problem at least twice so far:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/anw-k62wK-GhkHSI@monoceros/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20260908141538.731237-1-nik.borisov@suse.com/

It was years since I saw anyone with a Synopsys email contribute to their
PCIe controller driver, or their Ethernet controller drivers.

sata_dwc_460ex is an older DWC (Synopsys) SATA controller, newer DWC SATA
controllers are AHCI compliant and is using drivers/ata/ahci_dwc.c.

So that probably leaves us with the company who submitted this driver.
They don't seem to have sent anything since 2011, so I doubt that they
care about this driver either.

That said, we are happy to accept any patch for any driver for which you
actually have the hardware to test.


Kind regards,
Niklas
