Yes, in some of our systems, deviceA to deviceB is going through
different route than deviceB to deviceA.

My guess is that the hardware and system architects have ensured this
doesn't happen. At least, I haven't received any complaints about this
series during internal testing.

These names come from p2p users such as dma-buf and NVMe. I didn't want
to rename them as they already exists and is in use inside p2p code.
