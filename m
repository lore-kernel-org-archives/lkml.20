Well I agree, then we shouldn't be bringing up the topic of OS agnostic

I fully understand that this interface is already deployed in firmware and
that changing that firmware ABI may no longer be practical. However, I
think we need to separate two things: supporting an existing firmware ABI
and accepting that ABI as the abstraction exposed through the upstream SCMI
framework.

The former is a compatibility constraint for Qualcomm platforms. The latter
is an upstream interface and maintainability decision, and the existence of
deployed firmware cannot by itself determine that decision.

This was specifically targeted for having performance related tunables
outside of PERF protocol. If that is not possible, then I take back that
statement.

It is common for intermediate versions to receive Reviewed-by tags, but those
do not necessarily imply final acceptance of the entire series. If there is an
instance where I provided a Reviewed-by and later withdrew it without
providing a technical justification, please point it out.

Also, with code alone, please do not expect me to review these series
effectively. It took more than a year and half for the documentation to reach
a state where the design and implementation could be reasonably understood.
Now that we have sufficient improved documentation and a clearer understanding
of the approach, a proper and detailed review has just begun.

Therefore, I do not think it is fair to claim that these issues should have
been identified during reviews over the past two years. The lack of clear and
adequate documentation made meaningful review difficult, and I have repeatedly
requested improvements to the documentation for precisely this reason.

My concern with the generic extension protocol remains the multiplexing
model. SCMI protocol IDs are themselves the mechanism by which
independently defined functionality is identified, discovered and
versioned. Introducing another namespace underneath a single vendor
protocol, where an algorithm string selects effectively independent
interfaces with their own sets of param_ids, duplicates that mechanism and
makes protocol 0x80 a container for potentially unrelated functionality.

This is also why I suggested treating MEMLAT as a distinct vendor protocol.
I am not suggesting that MEMLAT can necessarily be replaced by the standard
Performance protocol or MPAM. Those are separate questions. If MEMLAT
semantics do not map to either of those, then that is a perfectly valid
reason for having a vendor protocol. But "this functionality requires a
vendor protocol" does not imply that the generic SET/GET/START/STOP
multiplexing protocol is the right upstream representation of it. I am
completely against such generalisation which will end up being ambiguous
sooner or later.

I also don't think the fact that this has gone through several revisions
means that architectural concerns can no longer be raised. I appreciate the
amount of work that has gone into the series and the changes made in
response to previous reviews, but neither elapsed time nor deployed
non-standard vendor firmware can make an upstream interface immutable
before it is merged. This series is not even properly versioned, carries
RFC still without version if it is no the first RFC. Anyways, there are
series that go through 15-20 versions before it get merged. See SCMI
telemetry itself at v11 already. So, I don't understand your complaint and
all I can say is welcome to the kernel development process if its still a
for you.

So I don't see this as a choice between accepting the current generic
protocol or abandoning users of existing firmware. Sorry!

If it is easier as you mentioned, yes please re-design MEMLAT and any other
algorithm as a separate vendor protocol. If it helps take this as NACK for
the current interface. Hopefully this helps you in making proper progress
on upstreaming using the standard development process.

This is not the only or first firmware ABI Qualcomm has failed to upstream
because it was all baked and couldn't be changed. So nothing new/surprise
at that end.

I don't quite understand this. Please elaborate.
