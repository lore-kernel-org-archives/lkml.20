The names are important, the values are not. 

There are two cases that currently use the same VMA_UFFD_* flags:
* the way VMA is registered with uffd, i.e. the 'mode' part
* the type of the user fault that the generic #PF handler passes to
  handle_userfault()

They are related, a fault in a VMA that was registered as MISSING will
never pass MINOR to handle_userfault(), but I think it'll be actually
clearer to separate them semantically, so that when you read a call site of
handle_userfault() it is clear what type of the fault it is and when you
parse userfaultfd code you see what modes user wanted for a VMA.

I can see that ;-)

Again, the bit numbers do not matter, they are the same because it's easy
to count from 0. I can make one of those count backwards if it helps :)

Yeah, and the PAGEFAULT_FLAG numbers are set in stone because it's uABI.

Didn't you suggest to make 'reason' an unsigned int as well?

'mode' in 6/6 is an unsigned int because if it were an enum it'd require
#include <linux/userfaultfd_k.h> in mm_types.h, see the commit message
there.
