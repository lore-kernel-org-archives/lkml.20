Add documentation for the TI ADS112C14 and ADS122C14 ADC driver.

These chips have several quirks that don't map cleanly to the usual IIO
ABI, so it is worth documenting them for users. This covers how the
devicetree channel nodes map to IIO channels, the system monitor
channels, the order in which the interdependent filter_type,
oversampling_ratio and sampling_frequency attributes need to be written,
the settlingtime attribute and when it applies, burnout current, GPIOs,
debugfs register access and the different behavior of buffered reads
depending on which trigger is used. Also include some devicetree
examples of typical sensor configurations.

+================
+ADS112C14 driver
+================
+
+ADC driver for Texas Instruments ADS112C14 and similar devices. The module name
+is ``ti-ads112c14``.
+
+Supported devices
+=================
+
+The following chips are supported by this driver:
+
+* `ADS112C14 <https://www.ti.com/product/ADS112C14>`_ (16-bit)
+* `ADS122C14 <https://www.ti.com/product/ADS122C14>`_ (24-bit)
+
+These are low-power ADCs with 8 analog inputs and an I2C interface. They are
+primarily designed for use with resistive sensors such as RTDs, thermocouples
+and resistive bridges.
+
+Supported features
+==================
+
+Measurement channels
+--------------------
+
+Each ``channel@`` node in the devicetree describes the conditions needed to
+take a particular measurement rather than just a physical input. In addition to
+the analog input(s), this includes the reference source, excitation currents,
+burnout current and input chopping. See the `ti,ads112c14.yaml`_ devicetree
+binding for the details.
+
+.. _ti,ads112c14.yaml: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/adc/ti,ads112c14.yaml
+
+The IIO channels in sysfs are named after the analog inputs given in the
+devicetree:
+
+* The ``single-channel = <X>`` devicetree property creates an ``in_voltageX``
+  channel.
+* The ``diff-channels = <X>, <Y>`` devicetree property creates an
+  ``in_voltageX-voltageY`` channel.
+* If the measurement uses the external reference and the
+  ``ti,refp-refn-resistor-ohms`` devicetree property is given, the measurement
+  is ratiometric to the resistor between REFP and REFN, so it is reported as an
+  ``in_resistanceX`` channel instead, where ``X`` is the positive input. In
+  this case, ``raw * scale`` gives the resistance in ohms.
+
+If a devicetree channel node has a ``label`` property, it can be read from the
+``in_*_label`` sysfs attribute.
+
+Unless the ``bipolar`` devicetree property is given, the raw value is unsigned.
+
+The ``in_*_scale`` sysfs attribute selects the PGA gain. The available values
+are listed in the ``in_*_scale_available`` sysfs attribute.
+
+Excitation currents are left enabled after a measurement until a measurement is
+made that does not use them.
+
+System monitor channels
+-----------------------
+
+The following channels are always present in sysfs, regardless of the
+devicetree:
+
+============================ ===============================================
+Channel                      Description
+============================ ===============================================
+``in_temp100``               Internal temperature sensor.
+``in_voltage101``            External reference voltage (REFP - REFN).
+``in_voltage102``            AVDD supply voltage.
+``in_voltage103``            DVDD supply voltage.
+``in_voltage104-voltage104`` Internal short, used for offset calibration.
+============================ ===============================================
+
+The chip measures the external reference, AVDD and DVDD through an internal
+attenuator that divides by 8. This is already taken into account in the scale,
+so ``raw * scale`` gives the actual voltage in millivolts.
+
+The internal short channel has a writable ``in_voltage104-voltage104_scale``
+sysfs attribute so that the PGA gain can be set to match the gain of the
+measurement channel being calibrated.
+
+When the external reference is a resistor driven by the excitation currents
+(e.g. in an RTD configuration), there is only a reference voltage while the
+excitation currents are enabled. So a measurement that uses the excitation
+currents needs to be made first, otherwise the ``in_voltage101`` reading will
+not be meaningful.
+
+Filter type, oversampling ratio and sampling frequency
+------------------------------------------------------
+
+The filter type, oversampling ratio and sampling frequency can be set per
+channel with the ``in_*_filter_type``, ``in_*_oversampling_ratio`` and
+``in_*_sampling_frequency`` sysfs attributes.
+
+On these chips, these three settings are tightly coupled and do not map
+directly to separate register fields. The available values of one attribute
+depend on the current value of the others, so the attributes must be written in
+a specific order:
+
+1. Write ``in_*_filter_type``.
+2. If the filter type is ``sinc4`` or ``sinc4+sinc1``, write
+   ``in_*_oversampling_ratio`` and then ``in_*_sampling_frequency``.
+3. If the filter type is ``sinc4+sinc1+pf1``, write ``in_*_sampling_frequency``
+   and then ``in_*_oversampling_ratio``.
+
+After each write, check the ``*_available`` sysfs attribute of the next
+attribute to see which values can be selected.
+
+Settling time
+-------------
+
+The ``in_*_settlingtime`` sysfs attribute sets the total time for the ADC to
+settle before it outputs the first conversion result after starting conversions
+or after changing settings. The ``in_*_settlingtime_available`` sysfs attribute
+gives the range of allowed values as ``[min step max]``.
+
+The minimum value is the fixed latency of the digital filter for the current
+filter type, oversampling ratio and sampling frequency. This already includes
+the time for the conversion itself. Selecting a larger value adds a
+programmable delay before the conversion starts, which can be used to allow
+external circuitry (e.g. filters on the analog inputs) to settle. The available
+delays are not evenly spaced, so the driver selects the smallest delay that
+gives at least the requested settling time. Read back the attribute after
+writing it to see the actual value.
+
+The settling time applies to more than just the first conversion in some
+cases:
+
+* In single-shot mode, every conversion is a first conversion. This includes
+  reading ``in_*_raw`` and buffered reads that are not using the DRDY trigger
+  (see `Device buffers`_).
+* When input chopping is enabled with the ``input-chopping`` devicetree
+  property, the input mux is swapped after each conversion, so every
+  conversion waits for the settling time. In this case, the actual data rate
+  is lower than ``in_*_sampling_frequency`` and is approximately
+  ``1 / settlingtime``.
+
+Burnout current
+---------------
+
+If a devicetree channel node has the ``burn-out-current-nanoamp`` property, the
+channel has an extra ``in_*_burnoutraw`` sysfs attribute. Reading it takes a
+single conversion with the burnout current sources enabled. This can be used to
+detect an open or shorted sensor. The burnout current affects the accuracy of
+the reading, so it is only enabled for this conversion and not for normal
+reads. Input chopping is also disabled during this conversion since the chip
+does not allow it to be used together with the burnout current sources.
+
+External clock
+--------------
+
+If the ``clocks`` devicetree property is given, the chip is clocked from the
+external clock on the GPIO3 pin instead of the internal 4.096 MHz oscillator.
+The available sampling frequencies and settling times in sysfs are scaled
+accordingly.
+
+I2C CRC
+-------
+
+The I2C CRC feature of the chip is always enabled. The driver checks the CRC of
+all register reads and direct reads. For buffered reads, see `Device buffers`_.
+
+GPIO controller
+---------------
+
+If the ``gpio-controller`` devicetree property is given, the AIN4/GPIO0 to
+AIN7/GPIO3 pins can be used as GPIOs. The lines are named ``iio:deviceN:GPIOx``.
+
+Pins that are used for something else according to the devicetree are not
+available as GPIOs. This includes:
+
+* Analog inputs and excitation current outputs used by any measurement channel
+  (AIN4 to AIN7 are GPIO0 to GPIO3).
+* GPIO0 and GPIO1 when an external reference is used (REFP and REFN share these
+  pins).
+* GPIO2 when ``interrupt-names`` contains ``fault``.
+* GPIO3 when ``interrupt-names`` contains ``drdy`` or when the ``clocks``
+  property is given.
+
+Outputs are always configured as push-pull.
+
+Debugfs register access
+-----------------------
+
+The chip registers can be read and written via the ``direct_reg_access``
+debugfs attribute. This can be used to check settings against the datasheet and
+to check status that is not otherwise available, such as the AVDD and reference
+undervoltage and fault flags in the ``STATUS_MSB`` register (0x02). For
+example:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ cd /sys/kernel/debug/iio/iio:device0
+    $ echo 0x02 > direct_reg_access
+    $ cat direct_reg_access
+
+Writing registers this way bypasses the driver, so it should only be used for
+debugging.
+
+Unimplemented features
+----------------------
+
+* Power management (power-down and standby modes).
+* Monitoring and events (e.g. AVDD and reference undervoltage, /FAULT pin).
+* Open-drain configuration of the GPIO outputs and /DRDY output.
+
+Device buffers
+==============
+
+This driver supports IIO triggered buffers. The behavior depends on which
+trigger is used.
+
+DRDY trigger
+------------
+
+If the ``interrupt-names`` devicetree property contains ``drdy``, the driver
+provides a trigger for it. The driver does not set the interrupt trigger type,
+so it must be given in the ``interrupts`` devicetree property. Since /DRDY is
+active low, this should be ``IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING``.
+
+When this trigger is used, the chip runs in continuous conversion mode and the
+data is read each time a conversion completes. In this mode, only one channel
+may be enabled at a time, and the data rate is given by the
+``in_*_sampling_frequency`` sysfs attribute of that channel (except when input
+chopping is enabled, see `Settling time`_).
+
+The trigger is not assigned by default, so it has to be selected by writing to
+the ``trigger/current_trigger`` sysfs attribute. The trigger is named
+``<name>-dev<N>-drdy``, where ``<name>`` is the value of the ``name`` sysfs
+attribute of the IIO device and ``<N>`` is the same number as in the
+``iio:device<N>`` directory name of the IIO device. For example, for
+``iio:device0``, ``<N>`` is ``0``:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0
+    $ echo "$(cat name)-dev0-drdy" > trigger/current_trigger
+
+Other triggers
+--------------
+
+When any other trigger is used (e.g. an hrtimer trigger), the chip runs in
+single-shot mode and each enabled channel is read in turn each time the trigger
+fires. In this mode, any number of channels may be enabled. Since every
+conversion includes the settling time, the trigger frequency cannot be set as
+high as ``in_*_sampling_frequency``. Each time the trigger fires, it takes at
+least the sum of the ``in_*_settlingtime`` values of all enabled channels plus
+the I2C communication time to read all of the channels. The trigger frequency
+needs to be low enough to allow for this.
+
+Buffer data format
+------------------
+
+Each sample is stored in 32 bits, big-endian, with the conversion result in the
+upper bits. The byte immediately following the conversion result contains the
+CRC byte sent by the chip. The driver does not check this CRC for buffered
+reads, so userspace can use it to detect and discard corrupted samples. The CRC
+is CRC-8 with polynomial 0x07 and initial value 0xFF, calculated over the bytes
+of the conversion result.
+
+Devicetree examples
+===================
+
+The following examples show some typical sensor configurations. See the
+datasheet for the corresponding circuit diagrams.
+
+2-wire RTD
+----------
+
+One excitation current drives both the RTD and the reference resistor, so the
+measurement is ratiometric and the RTD resistance is available from
+``in_resistance1_raw`` and ``in_resistance1_scale``.
+
+.. code-block::
+
+    adc@40 {
+        compatible = "ti,ads122c14";
+        reg = <0x40>;
+        avdd-supply = <&avdd>;
+        dvdd-supply = <&dvdd>;
+        ti,refp-refn-resistor-ohms = <500>;
+        #address-cells = <1>;
+        #size-cells = <0>;

+3-wire RTD
+----------
+
+Two matched excitation currents are used to cancel out the lead resistance.
+Input chopping is enabled to reduce offset errors.

+
+Resistive bridge with thermistor
+--------------------------------
+
+The bridge is excited by AVDD, which is also connected to REFP, so the bridge
+measurement is ratiometric. The thermistor is measured using the internal
+reference. The labels make it easy to find the channels in userspace.
