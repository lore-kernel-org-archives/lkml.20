  KVM: always make in-place conversion a compile-time constant when possible (2026-10-21 03:28:21 -0400)

There are some arm64 changes to support inclusion of arch/arm64/include
files from s390's arch/s390/kvm/arm64/ directory, which result in a
conflict with the arm64 tree.  For sysreg.h, the resolution at end of
message is a lot more wordy than the actual intervention required; the
actual conflict is just that Catalin's pull request removed the nearby
"#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN" block.

There is also a patch ("arm64: Use proper include variant") that is
included here as a build fix and is duplicate with the arm tree.

Thanks,

Paolo

----------------------------------------------------------------
ARM:

- pKVM state isolation: years after pKVM started being enabled upstream,
  we finally get the basics in the form of state isolation. The vcpu state
  is now off-limit for the host for protected VMs.

- pKVM also grows a hypervisor-private memory allocator, allowing it to
  deal with sub-page allocation, much like everywhere else.

- pKVM also lands a trace_printk() equivalent, which hopefully will make
  debugging a bit easier.

- First shot at annotating portions of the KVM/arm64 code to be extracted
  and built on s390. The real fun is yet to come.

- Allow pre-faulting of stage-2 canonical mappings from userspace, joining
  x86 and s390 in implementing this feature.

- Add a reverse mapping infrastructure for shadow stage-2, significantly
  improving performance when MMU notifiers kick in, and avoiding full unmap
  of all shadow tables for this VM.

- Next step of GICv5 enablement, adding support for the IRS block, and
  providing both SPI and LPI support.  This is the first point where
  KVM/arm64 can support an SMP GICv5 guest.

- As a preliminary to eventually enabling CCA, add a bunch of
  infrastructure to KVM/arm64, splitting some of the basic operations into
  individual backends (normal VM, normal pKVM VM, protected pKVM VM).  This
  allows CCA to later slot in without polluting the rest of KVM with its
  firmware-driven nonsense.

- Make ID registers immutable from the point where a vcpu is able to run,
  even if it fails to run. This prevents KVM from sampling untrusted values.

- Restore some type checking to the EL2 object. KVM/arm64 originally had
  some strong type checking between the kernel and the EL2 object, but
  lost it along the way when the private hypercall interface was (somewhat
  pointlessly) converted to SMCCC.  Type checking is back, syscall style,
  and with added sparse goodies.

- Expand the FFA support to FFA_NOTIFICATION_*, and add some sanitisation
  of the protocol that pKVM relays to the "trusted" runtime.

- Make GICv3 RD assignment more robust to userspace nonsense

- Convert the remaining MMU fault handler backends to kvm_s2_fault_vma_info
  and co., fixing a number of bugs in the process.

- Fix the SError/SEA selftests to be both more robust and less braindead.

- Fix a smattering of documentation bugs, some of them as a result of our
  AI friends spitting out credible assertions based on non-existing symbols.

- The usual collection of low impact bug fixes (SMCCC, timers, PMU).

Loongarch:

- Add separate vmid support.

- Simplify MSI interrupt injection.

- Add crash hypercall support.

- Allow to set pv_feature until vCPU run.

- Enable HW page table walk automatically in selftests.

s390:

- rework page allocation for secure guest variable storage

- Selftests and documentation improvements.

- Replace get_zeroed_page with kzalloc.

- Fix corner cases of floating interrupt injection.

- Initial arm64 on s390 support.

x86:

- Clean up the handling of vcpu->arch.xen.long_mode to be consistent and
  correctly handle 32-bit/64-bit alignment, and various other bug fixes have
  accumulated over the months since v1.

- Grab KVM's SRCU "lock" in kvm_zap_gfn_range() to fix a recurring bug where
  callers fail to do so.

- Fix a variety of issues in the pre-fault code that are mostly benign in the
  current code base, but will show up in big ways if/when the pre-faulting
  logic is used to implementing prefetch-on-fault for the TDP MMU.

- For PREEMPT_RT=y kernels, drop the rmaps' individual bit-spinlock and just
  walk the rmaps' with mmu_lock taken.  On the write side (which always uses
  mmu_lock), the bit-spinlock was assuming that preemption was disabled, but
  that is *not* true when rwlocks become sleepable.

- Prepare a memory_fault exit (paired with -EFAULT) when KVM hits an error
  PFN, e.g. so that userspace can resolve transient issues instead of killing
  the guest.  Convert a variety of WARN()+EFAULT paths into KVM_BUG_ON()+EIO
  so that KVM can hard commit to filling memory_fault on -EFAULTs that occur
  in the page fault path.

- Fix a NX hugepage un-accounting bug where KVM would always uncharge the
  shadow MMU, even when handling TDP MMU pages.

- Mask off the address space ID when checking for illegal usage of
  kvm_set_internal_memslot() to prevent false negatives on the sanity check.

- Explicitly zero reserved flags when delivering a SynIC message to avoid
  leaking a byte of stack information to the guest.

- Rework TDX's handling of the canonical MMU root level to not rely on
  userspace to fill CPUID correctly, as doing so lets userspace trivially
  trigger a KVM_BUG_ON().

- Reject KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE if userspace "restores" L1 with EFER.LMA=1 &&
  EFER.LME=0, which confuses KVM into trying to configure an 64-bit MMU
  without PAE.

- Ignore EFER.LMA (clear it from KVM's cached save state) if EFER.LME=0 when
  preparing L2 state, to fix another way to confuse KVM's MMU (and because
  real hardware also ignores EFER.LMA).

- Improve KVM's sanity checks for a misconfigured MMU to (hopefully) detect
  all of the ways KVM can botch EFER.LMA vs. CR4.PAE.

- Remove the "full" out-param from kvm_x86_ops.flush_tlb_gva() as the param
  is only used to avoid what effectively amounts to a single memory write.

- Fix a mostly-benign bug where KVM can write through a guest's read-only
  mapping due to not checking the error code when expediting emulated MMIO
  page faults.

- Honor the guest's view of the "EFER.LMSLE must be zero" defeature so that
  userspace can provide migration compatibility between Rome and Milan+.

- Pend a KVM_REQ_EVENT request when an exception is morphed into a nested
  VM-Exit, otherwise KVM can fail to actually deliver the nested VM-Exit,
  e.g. when injecting a page fault.

- Add support for PML on SVM.

- Add support for virtualizing Bus Lock Detect on SVM, and fix a number of
  DR6 bugs and warts along the way.

- Fix a variety of warts in KVM's handling of guest TSC, kvmclock, and
  timekeeping in general, as a (big) first step towards addressing several
  longstanding problems with the kvmclock implementation.  Most notably,
  fix a precision issue where get_kvmclock_ns() computed the clock from
  the *host* TSC without applying guest TSC scaling, causing systemic
  drift from the values the guest computes from its own TSC.

- Rip out KVM's shadow timekeeping structures, now that ktime snapshots
  are powerful enough to replace it.

- Misc fixes and cleanups.

x86 (AMD):

- Fix a benign-in-practice bug where KVM unintentionally sets a non-zero
  error code when delivering exceptions to SEV-ES+ guests.

- Force a new ASID in both VMCBs on pCPU migration to fix a bug where KVM
  can run a VMCB with a stale ASID due to the tracking being per-CPU, not
  per-VMCB.

- Return INVALID_INPUT to the guest instead of exiting to userspace with
  -EIO if KVM can't access "guest request" buffer, i.e. try to keep the
  guest alive if the guest or userspace goofs.

x86 (Intel):

- Enable Notify VM-Exits (now called Instruction Timeout in the SDM) and Bus
  Lock VM-Exits for TDX guests when they're enabled by userspace (KVM forgot
  to wire up the TDX Module knobs).

- Move all common (between VMX and TDX) APIs/helpers to common.h/main.c, and
  change all namespace prefixes from "vmx" to "vt".

- Fix a thankfully benign bug (due to other areas of KVM being hardened) where
  userspace can bypass INIT_MEM_REGION's address wrap check by providing a
  nr_pages that will overflow a u64 when converted to bytes, and fix an also-
  benign off-by-one bug in the check (inclusive vs. exclusive).

- Set the vmcs.GUEST_ACTIVITY_STATE back to ACTIVE when userspace sets KVM's
  mp_state to anything other than HALTED, e.g. so that a vCPU doesn't get
  stuck in HLT if userspace emulates RESET.

guest_memfd:

- Take the invalidate lock when unbinding a dying file to fix a race with
  kvm_gmem_invalidate_end() that results in KVM leaving the MMU invalidation
  count elevated.  Not taking the lock in the first place was pure misguided
  paranoid.

- When binding a memslot, purge the bindings if storing the new memslot fails,
  as Xarray's "store range" API can subtly fail partway through.

- Establish memslot<=>guest_memfd bindings *after* the memslot is ready, as
  the memslot becomes reachable the instant the binding is installed.

- Don't grab a page refcount when reloading an SNP VMSA and stop returning a
  "struct page" from guest_memfd's PFN lookup altogether, to ensure that KVM
  doesn't hold any unnecessary refcounts (the lifetime of the page is ensured
  by MMU notifiers and similar hooks).  Preventing unnecessary refcounts
  greatly simplifies supporting in-place SHARED=>PRIVATE conversions.

- Add support for in-place PRIVATE<=>SHARED conversion, i.e. allow a single
  guest_memfd instance to be used for both PRIVATE and SHARED variations of
  CoCo guests' memory (though not at the same time).  This eliminates the need
  to double allocate guest memory for TDX and SNP, and is basically a hard
  requirement for pKVM, which relies on being able to preserve memory contents
  on conversions.

- Hack-a-fix a deadlock bug in ->error_remove_folio() by returning -EBUSY if
  the filemap invalidate lock is contended.  Punt on a proper fix for the
  moment, as a proper fix likely involves reworking truncate_error_folio().

- Add a pile of selftests for in-place conversions.

- Misc guest_memfd cleanups

Generic:

- Move some configuration items to preprocessor symbols, to help with
  arm-on-s390's need to compile the same code twice with different values.

- Allow KVM implementations to choose alternative device names, also for
  s390's support of ARM virtualmachines.

- Switch the KVM-VFIO interface and external consumers over to standard
  file-based reference counting, eliminating all external KVM symbol exports.

Selftests:

- Rework KVM selftest's handling of memory regions all so that PPC can force its
  page table allocations to be naturally aligned.

- PPC support.

- Fix emulation of VMPTRST and VMPTRLD when eVMCS is in-use to match real
  Hyper-V's behavior.

- Saturate L2's TSC frequency if stacking L1 and L2 scaling multipliers
  exceeds what hardware supports, as attempting to run L2 with an illegal
  multiplier will either cause VM-Entry to fail (VMX) or trigger a #GP when
  writing MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO (SVM).  The #GP is thankfully benign in the
  grand scheme as even "unsafe" WRMSRs have exception fixup.

- Rework KVM selftest's handling of memory regions so that PPC can force its
  page table allocations to be naturally aligned.

- Clean up selftest's VMX instruction helpers, and drop an absurd number of
  completely useless return values, e.g. functions that unconditionally
  return %true and then have every caller assert success.

- Add selftests support for Zhaoxin CPUs.

- Overhaul the TSC scaling test to add a regression test for the saturation
  behavior, and to increase its coverage in general.

- Fix selftests usage various NUMA syscalls to account for an undocumented,
  but known since 2007, off-by-one kernel bug.  Add helpers to try and avoid
  re-introducing the same flaws in the future.

- Automatically run xAPIC IPI migration test (between NUMA nodes) when
  possible, as the entire point of the test is verify KVM's handling of page
  migration of the APIC backing page.

- Misc cleanups.
