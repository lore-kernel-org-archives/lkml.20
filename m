I think you should check for uid_valid(root) here.  A namespace
doesn't have to have a mapping for 0.

Maybe call it caller_root_kuid?

> +	uid_t id;

Can we call this something like rootid_in_targetns?
caller_root_in_targetns?

So if the caller's root id has a mapping in the target, then
since caller lacks CAP_SETFCAP, deny.  Good.

This next bit could maybe stand to be a clearly commented separate
static inline function.

> +	id = from_kuid(ns->parent, root);

So if there are no mappings yet into the target namespace, and if the
caller_root_kuid has a mapping into the target's parent ns,

> +	return id != (uid_t)-1 && uid_eq(ns->owner, root) &&
> +	       (id || ns->parent_could_setfcap);

then we restrict the userns_install if .. caller's root user is mapped
into the target namespace parent, and that user is the target
namespace's owner (creating user) and that user, at time of ns creation,
had setfcap?

I don't think the 'uid_eq(ns->owner, root)' is right, though.  So
long as it is the case that

	from_kuid(ns->parent, caller_root_kuid) != (uid_t)-1

then that means that, caller_root_kuid could get mapped into ns,
and a root process in ns could have setfcap over it.
