I think the point is the RFC needs to say why it can't be merged.
Otherwise we have to guess no documentation is because you don't know
that's a requirement or because it is an RFC.

Overlays were the plan when FPGA regions were added to the kernel. Not
sure why that never happened. I would suggest you go read any
discussions from that.

Not sure I'd go that far. There are plenty of areas that need
help/attention. And I don't like merging new things with only one user
because every time I do that, someone comes along right after wanting
something a bit different...
