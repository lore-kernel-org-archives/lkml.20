These topology problems were discussed at length in the case of DFSDM.
The main blocking point being support for interleaved channels (scan 
mode), a problematic issue that is still found with MDF.
The constraints that led to this approach are in the following thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210919191414.09270f4e@jic23-huawei/

FYI: An implementation attempt had been made also via the "concverter 
framework" proposal, but this approach has been abandoned in favor of 
the backend framework.
