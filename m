can: peak_usb: reject records for unset channels in PCAN-USB Pro

This patch changes the PCAN-USB Pro record decoders so they reject CAN
and status records whose channel slot in usb_if->dev[] is NULL. It also
clears the channel slot in pcan_usb_pro_free(). Slots are published with
smp_store_release() and read with READ_ONCE().

[Severity: Low]
Should a well-formed record for an unset channel cause the rest of the
transfer to be dropped?

pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() treats any negative return from the handlers
as fatal:

		case PCAN_USBPRO_RXRTR:
			err = pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg(usb_if, &pr->rx_msg);
			if (err < 0)
				goto fail;

Suppose channel 0 is open while channel 1's dev_init() is still running.
A channel 1 record then makes the decoder skip every later record in the
same bulk-IN transfer, including channel 0 frames and RXTS records.

The buffer is then dumped twice: once in pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() and
once in peak_usb_read_bulk_callback(). Neither dump is rate limited at
this commit.

Would it be better to skip just this record, for example by returning 0?
The same applies to the new check in pcan_usb_pro_handle_error().

Later in the series, "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" moves register_candev() into peak_usb_probe(),
after all channels are initialized. That seems to make this branch
unreachable by the end of the series. Also, "can: peak_usb: only dump
received bytes on decode error" rate-limits the dump in the core.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. Since
this function is being changed anyway: can the payload memcpy() further
down in pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg() read past the record and past the
RX buffer?

pcan_usb_pro_handle_canmsg() {
    ...
	can_frame->len = rx->len & 0x0f;
    ...
		memcpy(can_frame->data, rx->data, can_frame->len);
    ...
}

The length comes from a nibble set by the device (0..15). The only check
in pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() is that the record size chosen by data_type
fits in the transfer:

	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXMSG4] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 4,
	[PCAN_USBPRO_RXMSG0] = sizeof(struct pcan_usb_pro_rxmsg) - 8,

An RXMSG0 record is 12 bytes, so its data[] lies entirely after the
record. An RXMSG0 or RXMSG4 record with a length nibble of 8 would copy
bytes from past the end of the record.

Those bytes are stale or uninitialized parts of the 1024-byte RX buffer
that peak_usb_start() allocates with kmalloc(). If the record ends at
exactly 1024 bytes, the bytes come from beyond the allocation.

The frame passes can_is_can_skb() because len <= 8, and it is delivered
through netif_rx(). Can those kernel bytes then reach CAN_RAW sockets
through raw_recvmsg()?

With a nibble of 9..15, the memcpy() writes past the 8-byte
can_frame->data field into skb tailroom. That would trip the
FORTIFY_SOURCE field-spanning write check.

The issue is still present at the end of the series. Could the code
reject len > CAN_MAX_DLEN? It could also reject any length larger than
the record format provides: 0 for RXMSG0 and RXRTR, 4 for RXMSG4, and 8
for RXMSG8.

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does the caller,
pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf(), read pr->data_type before checking rec_ptr
against msg_end?

	for (; rec_cnt > 0; rec_cnt--) {
		union pcan_usb_pro_rec *pr = (union pcan_usb_pro_rec *)rec_ptr;
		u16 sizeof_rec = pcan_usb_pro_sizeof_rec[pr->data_type];

rec_cnt comes from the device. Take a 1024-byte transfer holding the
4-byte header and 51 complete RXMSG8 records (4 + 51 * 20 = 1024), with
rec_cnt set to 52. After the last record, rec_ptr points to the end of
the allocation, and the next iteration reads one byte past it.

The byte is only used as an index into the 256-entry table, and the
result then fails one of the checks that follow. The effect is a 1-byte
out-of-bounds slab read that KASAN would report. This code is unchanged
at the end of the series.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch, but
can usb_if still be used after this kfree() for channel 0?

At this commit, peak_usb_create_dev() calls register_candev() before
dev_init() and dev_set_bus(). Suppose userspace opens can0 in that
window, and dev_set_bus(dev, 0) then fails. The error path runs:

adap_dev_free:
	peak_usb_stop_rx(dev->prev_siblings);   /* NULL for channel 0 */

	if (dev->adapter->dev_free)
		dev->adapter->dev_free(dev);        /* kfree(usb_if) */

lbl_unregister_candev:
	unregister_candev(netdev);

peak_usb_stop_rx(NULL) stops nothing, so channel 0's own RX URBs keep
running. pcan_usb_pro_decode_buf() keeps using the usb_if returned by
pcan_usb_pro_dev_if(dev), and clearing the slot does not cover that
access.

unregister_candev() then closes the netdev, and ndo_stop reaches
pcan_usb_pro_stop(), which runs this on the freed object:

	pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count--;

Later in the series, "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" removes register_candev() and the
lbl_unregister_candev label from peak_usb_create_dev(). After that, no
netdev can be open when adap_dev_free runs, which seems to fix this.
