Oh, okay. IIUC it will be enough if PG_dirty flag is set once, right?

While on HAFDBS/HDBSS we will skip the fault for marking them dirty again, 
we always take the first fault for every PTE (or prefault them), so 
PG_dirty should always be set once the page is first wroten to.

Ah, I see your point.
During dirty-tracking guest reads a page, then HAFDBS promotes it to 
writable without marking it as dirty. Good catch!

But wouldn't a simpler solution be to change the conditions in the fault 
handler, so that it indeed marks it as dirty if dirty-tracking is on, even 
if it's just a read fault? 

Thanks!

Just as a note for future readers: on another thread we agreed to wait for 
the discussion to reach a point we are all happy before rebasing 
everything.
