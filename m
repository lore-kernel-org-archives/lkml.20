Fair point, sorry for that.

The commit message was purposely vague due to the fact that the change
fixes a security issue and I didn't want to publish a HOWTO guide for
exploiting it.  However, I obviously overdid it a little and left out
the reasoning you'd need to review the patch.  The short version is that
an unauthenticated peer can currently change an associated station's
power save state with frames that shouldn't be able to have that
capability which can be used against the station.

Happy to send you the details off-list.

Plans for v2 with your blessing:

 - Rewrite the commit message to explain the problem and the reasoning
   properly, rather than just quoting the spec.

 - Make the PM handling consistent in both directions, so it doesn't
   honour the bit in one case and ignore it in the other, while keeping
   the re-authenticating station case from 9fef65443388 working.

Does that work for you?
