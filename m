Did you look at that syzbot?  He has 1 reply on-list pointing to the
discussion and remedy of the issue - which was debug validation code
running outside the rcu lock.

Did you check this with lockdep?

Any access to the maple tree without holding the write lock or the rcu
read lock will cause lockdep to complain.

Likewise, any sleeping while holding the rcu read lock would produce
warnings.

Note that you do not need to hold the rcu read lock on the vma maple
tree if you have the write lock.  This looks to be the case for most (or
all?) of the cases you have below.

I suspect you have a locking issue in your modifications.

Please send patches as RFC if they need discussion.

It looks like you have asked gtp to fix the locking issue you have
discovered by editing the exit_mmap() function.  I suspect this
functions complex locking dance has fooled things up on you.

If any of these issues were a problem, lockdep would be reporting about
missing locks and people would have hit these in the last 3 years (the
last syzbot report which is resolved).  Your scenario isn't that unusual
- most cloud vendors run machines flat out with as much ram used as
possible.

Thanks,
Liam
