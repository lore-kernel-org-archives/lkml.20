Hi,

Unfortunately, this is ASPM thing is still wrong solution and you even=20
admit it yourself in a pci_info message that ASPM got enabled=20
"unexpectedly".

Please handle ASPM disabling (and reenabling) through the aspm driver, do=
=20
not write to ASPMC in this driver at all!! (For better disable/enable ASPM=
=20
driver API, you may have to look in one of the pending ASPM series and=20
build on top of that.)

If/when you need "inhibit", that should be done by the ASPM driver. Note=20
though that the way aspm driver handles state disabling is not entirely=20
satisfactory, It should probably keep counter for each ASPM state and only=
=20
allow enabling ASPM state X when nothing has disabled it, because a driver=
=20
could also want to disable ASPM and possibly re-enabled it later (e.g.=20
over a duration of a reset or fw update). Saving LNKCTL here would mess=20
that up so it should be ASPM driver's sole responsability to prevent=20
enabled ASPM prematurely if anything has asked a state to be kept off.

Some code comments are much longer than the code lines, and they are hard=
=20
to read because of that. The comments would be better to still be limited=
=20
to 80-chars, even if for code the 80 chars limit can be exceeded where it=

makes sense.


I see you also added HASW/HAWD handling which is good!

>   - Placed speed check immediately following pcie_get_speed_cap() and han=
dled PCI_SPEED_UNKNOWN (Ilpo J=C3=A4rvinen).
>   - Converted lanes in struct pci_margin_dev to a flexible array member w=
ith __counted_by(num_lanes) allocated via struct_size() (Ilpo J=C3=A4rvinen=
).

> Changes in v4:
>   - Added Sample Multiple Receivers (Bit 5) concurrency verification in m=
argin_lane_timing_write() and margin_lane_voltage_write() per PCIe r6.0 sec=
 8.4.4, returning -EBUSY if another lane on the same receiver is already ma=
rgined when simultaneous lane margining is not supported.
>   - Added active operating link speed verification (PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_CLS >=
=3D 16.0 GT/s) in margin_enable_write() before enabling LMR, as LMR command=
s are physically undefined on links operating at Gen1/Gen2/Gen3 speeds.
>   - Added fast-path hardware NAK detection in pci_lmr_run_cmd() to return=
 -EOPNOTSUPP immediately if a receiver echoes MTYPE =3D=3D NO_CMD (0x7) aft=
er command issuance rather than waiting 150ms for a timeout.
>   - Added pci_reset_lmr() hooked into __pci_reset_function_locked() to sy=
nchronize software state and demargin on FLR or Secondary Bus Reset.
>   - Comprehensive NULL pointer checks and array/lane/receiver bounds chec=
ks added across all internal helpers and debugfs write handlers.
>   - Added MAINTAINERS entry for PCIe Lane Margining at Receiver (LMR).
>=20
> Changes in v2:
>   - Fixed NO_CMD (0x7) clearing in pci_lmr_run_cmd() before issuing new c=
ommands per PCIe r6.0 sec 8.4.4.
>   - Protected plane->rx updates with mdev->lock in margin_lane_receiver_w=
rite().
>   - Corrected Margining Port Capabilities bit definition to PCI_LMR_PORT_=
CAP_USES_SW_READY (0x0001) in <uapi/linux/pci_regs.h>.
>   - Updated kselftest script (pcie_lmt.sh) to locate LMR debugfs entries.
>   - Validated integer bounds against LMR_MAX_TIMING_STEP / LMR_MAX_VOLTAG=
E_STEP before narrowing u8 cast.
>   - Moved mdev->enabled checks inside mutex_lock(&mdev->lock) to eliminat=
e TOCTOU races.
>   - Checked return values of all pci_read_config_word() calls, propagatin=
g -EIO on failure.
>   - Eliminated dead store of cap in margin_enable_write().
>   - Explicitly checked speed =3D=3D PCIE_SPEED_64_0GT in pci_lmr_init() t=
o avoid misidentifying PCI_SPEED_UNKNOWN (0xFF) as Gen6.

This feels like duplicating similar functionality with the aspm driver=20
that also wants to infer ends of the link when giving a pci_dev in. The=20
aspm driver currently does that within, but it kind of duplicating=20
pci_bus.

It would be nice to avoid the duplication and have something similar for=20
this in PCI core.

I'd have already tried to move it out of the aspm driver into pci_bus but=
=20
I highly suspect pci_bus is allocated too late for it to be trivial to=20
just embed link information into the struct pci_bus.
