Thanks for the investigation!

So, I think I understand the problem (rmap walks race PTE zapping, which no
longer serializes on the PTE lock), but I don't understand your solution at
all.

Namely, why moving this hunk of code up there makes any difference.
I suppose it's subtly changing memory order, but it's not immediate
in any way why this is correct.

What you really need (I think) is a happens-before relationship between
the rmap changes and the PMD zapping. Something like:

On top of your diff. Where the smp_wmb() is perhaps not required: I suppose TLB flushing
works as a sort of memory barrier itself on most/all architectures.
Either way, we have to document and fix expectations around this code.
