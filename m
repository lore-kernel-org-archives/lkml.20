Hi Luigi,
Thanks for looking into it.

I used 0 because the goal was to preserve the existing hardirq fast path
and avoid the throughput cost we had observed with threaded interrupts.

I have both modes on the same kernel image. Threaded interrupts did
prevent the lockup, but at QD256 they reached 3.165M IOPS versus 4.986M
with the IRQ-poll fallback. At QD1 they reached 21.2K versus 25.0K IOPS.

So threaded interrupts are a valid workaround, but on this system they
cost about 15% at QD1 and 37% at QD256 compared with the fallback.

More details in my initial cover letter.

GSIM was creating gaps for individual sources, but the other NVMe 
sources sharing that CPU were filling most of them.

I traced irq_handler_entry/irq_handler_exit with trace-cmd for the four 
NVMe queue vectors routed to CPU0. The test used GSIM fixed at 10 us 
with all 56 data-NVMe I/O vectors opted in.

Without timer push, I recorded 37,218 NVMe handler invocations in three 
seconds. The median handler duration was about 2 us, but the median gap 
between NVMe handlers was only 4 us. The p99 gap was 872 us.

With timer push enabled, the same three-second CPU0 trace contained only 
531 NVMe handler invocations, and the median gap increased from 4 us to 
517 us. This confirms your diagnosis, adding one delay per additional 
source restores a real CPU-wide gap.

The full QD256 workload then completed without a soft lockup or kernel 
taint. There was a significant cost, though. The delayed completions 
accumulated into much larger CQ batches:

   - median NVMe handler duration increased from 2 us to 3.1 ms
   - p99 handler duration increased from 106 us to 7.1 ms

For comparison on the same workload:

   fixed 10-us GSIM + timer push: 1.906M IOPS
   adaptive GSIM + timer push:    1.712M IOPS
   threaded NVMe IRQs:            3.165M IOPS
   NVMe IRQ-poll fallback:        4.986M IOPS

So the timer-push idea does prevent the lockup, and the trace confirms 
the multi-source gap issue. On this NVMe topology, however, delaying all 
sources creates very large completion batches, and the NVMe handler 
still drains each batch without a bound in hardirq context. That causes 
the large throughput and tail-latency cost above.

Naman
