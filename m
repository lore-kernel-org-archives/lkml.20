  This lowest-common-denominator issue suggests that resctrl may need a
  logical CLOSID/RMID namespace that is independent of the ID space
  implemented by each hardware controller.

  A resctrl group would retain a system-wide logical CLOSID/RMID, while
  each resource or architecture backend maps those logical IDs to its
  controller-local allocation entries and monitoring counters. This would
  avoid unconditionally limiting the number of resctrl groups to the
  minimum ID count across all enabled resources.

  The current resctrl allocation model uses that minimum as the
  system-wide CLOSID limit, which is safe for direct indexing but leaves
  additional entries in larger controllers unused.

  On the RISC-V CBQRI side, we are discussing a hardware mechanism that
  could provide such per-controller mapping while requests continue to
  carry the logical RCIDs/MCIDs:
