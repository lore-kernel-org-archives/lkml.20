It has been about 4 years since we came up with 07eab0901ede IIRC we
had a huge email thread with a whole bunch of attempts at fixing
the issue in a generic manner.

IIRC some of those attempts tried to identify the exact problematic
issue the quirks try to fix where there is an EFI MMIO reservation
covering the entire bridge window.

Maybe we can dig through the old thread and see if with the knowledge
we have now one of the previous attempts of fixing it from the thread
is better?

I agree that needing to go back to quirks is likely going to be painful
and break a whole bunch of other systems. IIRC 07eab0901ede fixed
a whole bunch of laptops having issues around the time not just
the Clevo NL4XLU and Lenovo Yoga C940. But this info might be spread
over various bugzilla entries, etc. + some models where likely never
reported but just fixed in time for users to not report things.

I also wonder if given we only have this magic black-hole on geneo/zen4
if it would not be better to go with Mario's original approach here ?
Esp. since Mario's quirk is chipset based where as the other problems
seem to be model/product based so that is 1 quirk vs many quirks.

Regards,

Hans
