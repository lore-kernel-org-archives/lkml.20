Hello!

Thanks for the review!

What other ways of driving a terminal are you alluding to?  (I assume
the LLM wrote that?  Did it make that up, or does it have another trick
up its sleeve for sending signals that we are overlooking?)

LANDLOCK_SCOPE_SIGNAL was previously described in two lines here.
Now we have 15 lines, 13 of which are talking exclusively about the PTY corner
case.  I am afraid this will water down the main message here.

I understand that LLMs can help in writing good English, but they also
have a tendency to be much more verbose than the existing text and can
direct the reader's attention away from the main points with that.

Suggested replacement:

  Holding a PTY master FD still grants the capability to issue signals
  through that PTY to the processes running under that terminal.

Does that seem reasonable?

Listing the full list of signals that can be sent through a PTY seems like an
excessive level of detail here.  But if you find a reference listing
the same signals in kernel doc or a stable URL, we could link it from
the docs.


Please also add an (even shorter) remark to the landlock.h header
file's description of LANDLOCK_SCOPE_SIGNAL, similar in length to the
one we added for the whiteout objects for LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG
recently.

Some meta-level remarks:

* Please send new patch sets as top-level emails rather than as
  responses to existing mail threads.  (It is not technically wrong to
  do that, but they do get overlooked within mail threads more often.
  To connect the dots, you can link the original mail on lore as
  you've already done here as well.)

* *If you want*, a thing that would still be worthwhile having in code
  would be a regression selftest for this signal sending path.  This
  is similar to the tests you've already created in your initial
  patchset, but would now check that signal sending *works* despite
  the sender being in the scoped domain.

(For transparency, I should remark that the final decision on this
code review is still up to Mickaël in the end.  I do believe that this
approach is the best solution, but the reasoning is less clear-cut
than in other bugs we had before.)

Thanks,
—Günther
