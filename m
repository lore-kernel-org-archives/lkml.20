Do you have an actual suggestion on how to fix it instead? It is
needed for every SPI controller that uses cs-gpios which is
potentially all of them. There's 522 cases of cs-gpios and only a few
are NAND. Even if it is 10 boards per SoC, that's still 52 cases which
would be more than I want to list in the kernel.

Perhaps the SPI core when requesting "cs-gpios" could state "apply the
polarity quirk to to this GPIO" rather than the GPIO core having any
specific knowledge about "cs-gpios".

However, IMO, for bus nodes, the node names are ABI. That's the only
way we can identify what type of bus for some buses. The DT core looks
for "isa", "pci" or "pcie" node names for ISA and PCI buses for
example. So I don't have much issue with the current approach.
