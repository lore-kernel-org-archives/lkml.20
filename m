The RT_GROUP_SCHED is broken beyond repair and it is to not enable it
during compile. If enabled it is recommended to disable it at boot time
with the rt_group_sched= option.
With it enabled it is not possible to set the policy of a task to
SCHED_{FIFO|RR} because its cgroup has no runtime assigned. The runtime
can not be assigned with cgroup v2. The root group has however all the
runtime assigned meaning the global sysctl runtime parameter
(sched_rt_runtime_us) can no be reduced because the new bandwidth will
be less than what is current available.
It is possible to schedule SCHED_DEADLINE tasks but the admission
control is stuck can only be disabled via -1 (same sysctl parameter).

As a result all major distors (Debian, Open Suse, Fedora, Archlinux)
have it disabled.

I don't think it is needed to somehow fix RT_GROUP_SCHED. The DL fair
server already handles the RT throttling mechanism. There is work on
Hierarchical constant bandwidth server (HCBS) which aim to group
multiple real-time tasks within one deadline configuration.

Remove CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED.

-0. WARNING
-==========
-
- Fiddling with these settings can result in an unstable system, the knobs are
- root only and assumes root knows what he is doing.
-
-Most notable:
-
- * very small values in sched_rt_period_us can result in an unstable
-   system when the period is smaller than either the available hrtimer
-   resolution, or the time it takes to handle the budget refresh itself.
-
- * very small values in sched_rt_runtime_us can result in an unstable
-   system when the runtime is so small the system has difficulty making
-   forward progress (NOTE: the migration thread and kstopmachine both
-   are real-time processes).
-
-1. Overview
-===========
-
-
-1.1 The problem
----------------
-
-Real-time scheduling is all about determinism, a group has to be able to rely on
-the amount of bandwidth (eg. CPU time) being constant. In order to schedule
-multiple groups of real-time tasks, each group must be assigned a fixed portion
-of the CPU time available.  Without a minimum guarantee a real-time group can
-obviously fall short. A fuzzy upper limit is of no use since it cannot be
-relied upon. Which leaves us with just the single fixed portion.
-
-1.2 The solution
-----------------
-
-CPU time is divided by means of specifying how much time can be spent running
-in a given period. We allocate this "run time" for each real-time group which
-the other real-time groups will not be permitted to use.
-
-Any time not allocated to a real-time group will be used to run normal priority
-tasks (SCHED_OTHER). Any allocated run time not used will also be picked up by
-SCHED_OTHER.
-
-Let's consider an example: a frame fixed real-time renderer must deliver 25
-frames a second, which yields a period of 0.04s per frame. Now say it will also
-have to play some music and respond to input, leaving it with around 80% CPU
-time dedicated for the graphics. We can then give this group a run time of 0.8
-* 0.04s = 0.032s.
-
-This way the graphics group will have a 0.04s period with a 0.032s run time
-limit. Now if the audio thread needs to refill the DMA buffer every 0.005s, but
-needs only about 3% CPU time to do so, it can do with a 0.03 * 0.005s =
-0.00015s. So this group can be scheduled with a period of 0.005s and a run time
-of 0.00015s.
-
-The remaining CPU time will be used for user input and other tasks. Because
-real-time tasks have explicitly allocated the CPU time they need to perform
-their tasks, buffer underruns in the graphics or audio can be eliminated.
-
-NOTE: the above example is not fully implemented yet. We still
-lack an EDF scheduler to make non-uniform periods usable.
-
-
-2. The Interface
-================
-
-
-2.1 System wide settings
-------------------------
-
-The system wide settings are configured under the /proc virtual file system:
-
-/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us:
-  The scheduling period that is equivalent to 100% CPU bandwidth.
-
-/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us:
-  A global limit on how much time real-time scheduling may use. This is always
-  less or equal to the period_us, as it denotes the time allocated from the
-  period_us for the real-time tasks. Without CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED enabled,
-  this only serves for admission control of deadline tasks. With
-  CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED=y it also signifies the total bandwidth available to
-  all real-time groups.
-
-  * Time is specified in us because the interface is s32. This gives an
-    operating range from 1us to about 35 minutes.
-  * sched_rt_period_us takes values from 1 to INT_MAX.
-  * sched_rt_runtime_us takes values from -1 to sched_rt_period_us.
-  * A run time of -1 specifies runtime == period, ie. no limit.
-  * sched_rt_runtime_us/sched_rt_period_us > 0.05 inorder to preserve
-    bandwidth for fair dl_server. For accurate value check average of
-    runtime/period in /sys/kernel/debug/sched/fair_server/cpuX/
-
-
-2.2 Default behaviour
----------------------
-
-The default values for sched_rt_period_us (1000000 or 1s) and
-sched_rt_runtime_us (950000 or 0.95s).  This gives 0.05s to be used by
-SCHED_OTHER (non-RT tasks). These defaults were chosen so that a run-away
-real-time tasks will not lock up the machine but leave a little time to recover
-it.  By setting runtime to -1 you'd get the old behaviour back.
-
-By default all bandwidth is assigned to the root group and new groups get the
-period from /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us and a run time of 0. If you
-want to assign bandwidth to another group, reduce the root group's bandwidth
-and assign some or all of the difference to another group.
-
-Real-time group scheduling means you have to assign a portion of total CPU
-bandwidth to the group before it will accept real-time tasks. Therefore you will
-not be able to run real-time tasks as any user other than root until you have
-done that, even if the user has the rights to run processes with real-time
-priority!
-
-
-2.3 Basis for grouping tasks
-----------------------------
-
-Enabling CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED lets you explicitly allocate real
-CPU bandwidth to task groups.
-
-This uses the cgroup virtual file system and "<cgroup>/cpu.rt_runtime_us"
-to control the CPU time reserved for each control group.
-
-For more information on working with control groups, you should read
-Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.rst as well.
-
-Group settings are checked against the following limits in order to keep the
-configuration schedulable:
-
-   \Sum_{i} runtime_{i} / global_period <= global_runtime / global_period
-
-For now, this can be simplified to just the following (but see Future plans):
-
-   \Sum_{i} runtime_{i} <= global_runtime
-
-
-3. Future plans
-===============
-
-There is work in progress to make the scheduling period for each group
-("<cgroup>/cpu.rt_period_us") configurable as well.
-
-The constraint on the period is that a subgroup must have a smaller or
-equal period to its parent. But realistically its not very useful _yet_
-as its prone to starvation without deadline scheduling.
-
-Consider two sibling groups A and B; both have 50% bandwidth, but A's
-period is twice the length of B's.
-
-* group A: period=100000us, runtime=50000us
-
-	- this runs for 0.05s once every 0.1s
-
-* group B: period= 50000us, runtime=25000us
-
-	- this runs for 0.025s twice every 0.1s (or once every 0.05 sec).
-
-This means that currently a while (1) loop in A will run for the full period of
-B and can starve B's tasks (assuming they are of lower priority) for a whole
-period.
-
-The next project will be SCHED_EDF (Earliest Deadline First scheduling) to bring
-full deadline scheduling to the linux kernel. Deadline scheduling the above
-groups and treating end of the period as a deadline will ensure that they both
-get their allocated time.
-
-Implementing SCHED_EDF might take a while to complete. Priority Inheritance is
-the biggest challenge as the current linux PI infrastructure is geared towards
-the limited static priority levels 0-99. With deadline scheduling you need to
-do deadline inheritance (since priority is inversely proportional to the
-deadline delta (deadline - now)).
-
-This means the whole PI machinery will have to be reworked - and that is one of
-the most complex pieces of code we have.
