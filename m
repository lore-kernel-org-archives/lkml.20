Very good point. I think we need to think for net rx for two scenarios. First,
the modern NICs with rx steering support and second, old NIC with shared queues.

On the modern NICs where the workloads get their own rx queues, I think the
proposed mechanism can help to do the accurate accounting (I have to extend this
to softirqs as it is limited to kthreads atm) very easily.

The challenge you mentioned is for the old NICs where we get to know the cgroup
assosiation of the rx packets very late (or deep) in the stack. Also CPU spent
on each packet is not necessarily uniform (due to out-of-order or drops or
checksum errors or window shrinking) but for simplicity we can assume uniform
CPU. Maybe the right place to charge for such scenario might be at application
receiving those packets into the memory. I feel like we might need a very
special way to account for this case (maybe through BPF or something). At
the moment to me it seems very hard to have a universal solution which helps
this case and the reclaim case I am targetted.

If you don't mind, I think having solution for modern NICs i.e. dedicated rx
queues, should suffice for now (unless you want the solution for old NICs as
well). Let me know what you think.

Sounds good, I will remove this capping in the next version.

Thanks for taking a look.
