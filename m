I meant the different thing.I was saying if a Feature in a kernel will have
constant value either required or optional which is fixed at compile time.
But the same feature can have different values in two different kernels.

I am not finding a good example, But I am skeptical about making the
assumption for all future kernels that the features will always be
required if they were required before.

Maybe a seal added in kernel version M. Later in kernel  version N this sea=
l is
deprecated and replaced by a new seal.

So transition from M->N
source kernel will preserve the seal values and flag the feature as require=
d.
target kernel will mark it supported and use its value to translate
into a new seal.

From N -> Z (latest)

Old seal is no longer required, But the new seal is required, so kernel N w=
ill
mark the new seal as required. and Z will support it.

This is hypothetical example. I'm not sure this is enough to convince the p=
oint.
So, I will rely on others to chime in with their thoughts.

So For #NR number of features, We will end up using 2*NR bits which
is exactly same number of bits, V3 [2] uses. So this is just a different
way of encoding in implementation perspective.

What if a buggy source sets both required and optional for a feature?
That is an invalid case here. Same as 0b10 is an invalid value set by
buggy kernel.

As I explained above, incase a feature is replaced by another feature,
new kernel
can support it deserialization but it will not be required from there on. S=
o
The supported table will still be needed.

Yes, because I thought 0b10 could be used in the future. And Currently
If it is set by a source kernel, it is buggy source kernel. But I can chang=
e
back to INVALID, As you said, it overlaps with valid field 0b00.
