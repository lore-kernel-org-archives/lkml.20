Oh, that's awful. Nothing should be calling into iomap_writepages
from reclaim context.

i.e. Doing data writeback from the inode cache shrinker is extremely
suboptimal for many reasons, so I'd consider this a gfs2 bug, not an
iomap issue. It's even worse when data writeback is being driven by
an inode cache shrinker. I'm surprised that lockdep hasn't thrown a
hissy-fit over this (i.e. inode locks taken in writeback appearing
both above and below reclaim.

This is the patch series that Jan Kara came up with to deal with
these issues in inode eviction:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20261009133253.20102-1-jack@suse.cz/

This allows filesystems to defer inode eviction that might block
(e.g. due to transaction reservations, journal commits, metadata
read requirements, data writeback requirements, etc) to a context
where the work is allowed to block and isn't running under memory
reclaim context or restrictions.

That patchset is needed for ext4, XFS alreayd does this, and it
would seem that gfs2 needs it for glock reclaim....

It's also long standing, known broken behaviour w.r.t. shrinkers
running in memory reclaim contexts.

So, why doesn't this warning happen through the direct reclaim path?
i.e.  what makes only kswapd trigger this?

I see nothing that prevents direct reclaim doing inode eviction
from triggering this same path through gfs2_evict_inode(). IOWs,
direct reclaim should also be triggering the warning in
iomap_writepages(), hence it is not clear to me why re-adding the
kswapd guard is anything other than a band-aid over the broken code
in gfs2....

No, that was a regression fix for turning off all writeback from
reclaim in XFS as a 'what problems does stopping mm reclaim
writeback actually cause' experiment. That was the first steps we
took down the path to get rid of the problematic random dirty page
writeback issues that memory reclaim had.

IOWs, we didn't want to allow it, but we had to tolerate it because
the MM behaviour was unfixable at the time. Now that the
pageout()->.writepage() path for dirty filebacked page writeback is
gone from the mm, we no longer have to tolerate this behaviour 
and so the guard got removed. It only took 15 years to get to this
point....

tl;dr: Writeback through iomap in memory reclaim context is -a bug-.

This is definitely a gfs2 bug - writeback can fail for -many-
reasons, so ignoring IO submission failures when data integrity is
required is a definitely filesystem bug.

AFAICT, direct reclaim will still trigger this warning and the bad
gfs2 behaviour, so I'm struggling to see this as anything other than
shooting the messenger...

Cheers,

Dave.
