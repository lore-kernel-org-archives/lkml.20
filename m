Very good to see it sleeps just fine. So yeah a command is missing... On to=
p of my mind there are a few possibilities:

- is has a tuf leds power devid in asus-wmi (please check in /sys/class/pla=
tform/asus* what's available
- as the previous one, but firmware is bugged and the query of the capabili=
ty returns not supported while the write goes through (there is at least an=
other model doing that)
- it supports ROG-style power controls of zones and asusctl is lacking supp=
ort
- it has some other devid for that

First thing I would do is to follow instructions in gitlab.com/asus-linux/r=
everse-engineering to grab the acpi and search for devid that does things (=
I suggest an llm to quickly find unmapped/missing IDS) and if that fails I =
would head to windows to see what the asus software sends over USB... On wh=
at I deal with (ROGs mainly) the application is armoury crate, but perhaps =
on zenbooks and other line-ups it's not available and you only have myasus.

If that fails, and windows gets leds off, with "fails" meaning there is no =
command to tell the firmware what to do on s2idle.... Fire up a windows VM,=
 pass the hid device to it, setup the vm for s2idle and run a capture with =
wireshark on linux.... That should tell you if an explicit command is neede=
d.

If that's the case setup userspace to turn leds off, don't do it in kernel =
or TUFs will break lighting while in s2idle.
