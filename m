I think so, at least from the hypervisor front. Secure AVIC uses a 
guest-private, encrypted APIC backing page. KVM's APIC_TMR is not 
visible to the guest and the only injection mechanism is via 
VMCB->Requested_IRR field, which can only carry vectors. This means 
APIC_TMR in the guest backing page will never be set. So, all guest 
writes to APIC_EOI are accelerated and do not cause an exit.

The guest could track level-triggered interrupts and notify the 
hypervisor though. But, it isn't clear to me that is necessarily better.  
Linux already seems to have a fallback which works for I/O APIC (see 
below).

I believe TDX has similar restrictions?

My understanding is that the guest will have to signal EOI to the I/O 
APIC directly. Linux seems to do so (ioapic_ack_level() calls 
eoi_ioapic_pin() if APIC_TMR is not set for a level-triggered 
interrupt).
