Hi Waiman,

The concern is placement-dependent performance variation between
vCPUs sold under the same specification. Customers do not see which
host CPU backs their vCPU, so such differences would appear as
unexplained variation within the same specification.

At full allocation, we want a consistent non-idle tick policy across
the allocated CPUs to avoid this additional source of variation.

Yes. We run cloud hosts with vCPU threads pinned one-to-one to host
CPUs. Some CPUs are kept outside nohz_full for housekeeping, but
they also provide vCPU capacity at full allocation. Dedicating them
exclusively to housekeeping would reduce the capacity available to
guests.

At full allocation, vCPUs also run on housekeeping CPUs, which
retain their non-idle tick. Allowing only the nohz_full CPUs to stop
the tick would introduce a placement-dependent difference in tick
behavior between vCPUs of the same specification.

We therefore want to restore the non-idle tick on those nohz_full
CPUs, accepting the extra tick overhead to remove this controllable
difference. Host-side background activity is limited in this
deployment, and we can tolerate the remaining housekeeping noise.

With spare capacity, we want to allow selected nohz_full CPUs to
stop the tick to reduce host scheduler-tick interference with guest
execution. This is an opportunistic optimization when capacity
permits.

Host allocation changes as customers acquire or release vCPUs, while
other customers' VMs continue running.

A nohz_full CPU hosting a remaining vCPU may still have that vCPU
thread as its only runnable task, whether the host is fully or
partially allocated. The existing tick dependencies therefore do
not express the desired change in policy.

The proposed control allows per-CPU runtime changes without taking
CPUs offline or changing the boot-time nohz_full set or other
isolation settings.

Thanks,
Peng
