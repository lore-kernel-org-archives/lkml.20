This series fixes three independent bugs in the Xilinx AXI IIC driver
that together make SMBus block reads with PEC return -EBADMSG or -EIO
on otherwise clean transfers. They only surface when the client has
I2C_CLIENT_PEC set; non-PEC block reads happen to mask each issue in
turn.

The problems were uncovered driving an adm1266 PMBus device behind a
Xilinx AXI IIC FPGA block and reading its 64-byte blackbox record.

Patch 1 stops xiic_smbus_block_read_setup() from truncating rx_msg->len.
The i2c core appends a byte to msg->len when PEC is enabled, so
overwriting the length to "block size + 1" silently drops the PEC byte
and i2c_smbus_check_pec() then reads the last payload byte as the PEC.

Patch 2 raises the RX_FULL threshold so the interrupt only fires once
every remaining byte (payload plus optional PEC) is already buffered in
the FIFO. The previous threshold of rxmsg_len - 2 caused the
bytes_rem == 1 path in xiic_read_rx() to NACK a byte still on the wire.
The chunk-vs-defer guard now also accounts for the PEC byte so a
rxmsg_len == IIC_RX_FIFO_DEPTH PEC-enabled read does not push
XIIC_RFD_REG_OFFSET past its 4-bit range.

Patch 3 stops the BNB handler from forcing tx_msg->len = 1 to signal
completion. tx_msg and rx_msg alias the same i2c_msg during a receive,
so this also clobbered rx_msg->len; and because tx_pos is already at 2
in the PEC case, the unsigned subtraction in xiic_tx_space() underflowed
and the STATE_DONE check fell through to STATE_ERROR. Advancing tx_pos
up to msg->len drives tx_space to zero without touching the length.

All three patches are pure bug fixes; non-PEC behaviour is unchanged.

Tested on a Xilinx AXI IIC on an NH-4010, against an ADM1266 reporting a
zero-length block (padded branch) and a Murata D1U74T-W PSU reporting 4
to 21-byte blocks (deferred and chunked branches); both enable PEC.
Unpatched, pmbus_core creates no mfr_* debugfs files for either and every
PEC-enabled block read fails with -EIO; patched, all read back correctly.
The same transfers through i2c-dev with I2C_M_RECV_LEN cover pec_len 0..5
and both sides of rxmsg_len + pec_len == IIC_RX_FIFO_DEPTH. Routing them
through xiic_xfer_atomic exercises patch 1's second trim site in
xiic_recv_atomic; block lengths 0 to 32 read back correctly there too.

Changes in v7:
- Patch 1: move the chunk-vs-defer guard widening
  (rxmsg_len + pec_len > IIC_RX_FIFO_DEPTH) and the pec_len term in the
  normal branch's rfd_set here from patch 2 (Andi). Patch 1 widened the
  padded-branch condition but left the normal branch computing
  rxmsg_len - 2, which the widening newly made reachable with
  rxmsg_len < 2, underflowing the u8; only patch 2 repaired it. Traced
  on hardware with a zero-length block: at pec_len == 2 the v6 patch 1
  programs RFD with 254, this one with 0. With the bounds that protect
  the new arithmetic in the same patch, patch 1 no longer depends on
  patch 2.
- Patch 2: now purely the threshold change, rxmsg_len + pec_len - 2 ->
  - 1, with the rationale for why it stays inside the 4-bit field.
- Patch 3 unchanged. Resulting tree is identical to v6.

Changes in v6:
- Patch 1: also trim rx_msg->len in xiic_recv_atomic() (Andi). An
  I2C_M_RECV_LEN message forces standard mode for the whole transfer,
  so an atomic SMBus block read reaches the same padded branch but
  completed without the trim. The trim moved into a small helper,
  xiic_smbus_trim_len(), now called from both sites that clear rx_msg.
- Patches 2 and 3 unchanged.
- Link to v5: https://patch.msgid.link/20260921-i2c-xiic-v5-0-2fca81e810ea@nexthop.ai

Changes in v5:
- Patch 1: clear smbus_actual_len in xiic_start_recv() so the trim state
  is reset before every receive (Andi). Only the padded branch sets it,
  and a block read aborted by arbitration loss or a TX error returns
  through the error path without reaching the completion site, so a
  stale value could trim the length of an unrelated later read.
- Patch 3: drop the defensive smbus_actual_len reset in the BNB handler,
  now redundant with the reset in patch 1, and the paragraph describing
  it. No other change.
- Patch 2 unchanged.
- All three patches now carry a Fixes: tag and Cc: stable. All three
  bugs were introduced together by e4c1ff772e1a ("i2c: xiic: Add
  smbus_block_read functionality"), first released in v6.3, and a PEC
  block read needs all three to complete, so they should be backported
  as a set.
- Shubhrajyoti Datta's Reviewed-by from v1 is still not carried over.
  Shubhrajyoti, if the current code looks good to you, a fresh tag would
  be appreciated.
- Link to v4: https://patch.msgid.link/20260909-i2c-xiic-v4-0-218df31e9d3b@nexthop.ai

Changes in v4:
- No code changes; resend of v3 to collect Michal Simek's Acked-by
  (given on the v3 cover letter) into each patch.
- Shubhrajyoti Datta's Reviewed-by from v1 is not carried over since all
  three patches have changed since then. Shubhrajyoti, if the current
  code still looks good to you, a fresh tag would be appreciated.
- Link to v3: https://patch.msgid.link/20260513-i2c-xiic-v3-0-ccb3cf70ba03@nexthop.ai

Changes in v3 (addresses the sashiko automated review of v2):
- Patch 1: handle short SMBus block reads where the controller pads
  rx_msg->len up to SMBUS_BLOCK_READ_MIN_LEN for its end-of-message
  workaround. In v2 this branch left the PEC byte at the padded
  offset rather than the actual end-of-payload, so the i2c core's
  PEC validator read past the chip data. Track the on-wire length
  in a new smbus_actual_len field populated in the minlen branch
  of xiic_smbus_block_read_setup(), and trim rx_msg->len back at
  RX_FULL completion before passing the message up. Addresses
  sashiko's v2 note about the pec_len adjustment missing the
  rxmsg_len < 3 padding branch; that branch was indeed the cause
  of pmbus_check_block_register() silently failing on zero-length
  MFR_* fields and skipping debugfs auto-discovery on affected
  hardware.
- Patch 3: defensively reset smbus_actual_len in the BNB completion
  handler so a subsequent non-SMBus transfer cannot see a stale
  trim value from a completed short block read.
- Patch 2 is unchanged from v2. sashiko's two other v2 notes were
  investigated and judged not to require code changes: the concern
  about removed padding in the chunked-vs-deferred drain misread
  the patch (the padding survives via the else branch and the new
  PEC-aware guard preserves the original semantics), and the
  flagged unsigned underflow in xiic_tx_space() is unreachable
  because tx_pos is bounded by tx_msg->len at the call site.
- Link to v2: https://patch.msgid.link/20260511-i2c-xiic-v2-0-c16380cb1594@nexthop.ai

Changes in v2:
- Patch 2: widen the chunk-vs-defer guard in xiic_smbus_block_read_setup()
  to include pec_len, so a 16-byte PEC-enabled block read routes through
  the chunked drain rather than writing 16 into the 4-bit
  XIIC_RFD_REG_OFFSET register. No tree-level change to patches 1 or 3.
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20260427-i2c-xiic-v1-0-e6207f9aa5ad@nexthop.ai
