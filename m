Thanks a lot for this background, Marc.

I guess we should take advantage of this qcom feature to at least
avoid some issues.  I think we just need to update the commit log to
clarify:

  - The reason this is important: apparently lots of AER interrupts
    but sounds like unrecoverable SError in some cases; I think it
    would be useful to understand the differences and whether CT and
    UR are handled differently.

  - What the result of the ECAM blocker is.  IIUC it blocks both
    config and MMIO.  I assume it prevents transactions from reaching
    PCIe so they don't cause UR or CT; maybe writes are dropped and
    reads return ~0 for both config and MMIO?

  - This is best-effort but not 100% because accesses between
    link-down and ECAM blocker being enabled can still cause AER
    interrupts and SError.

I'm more interested in these PCIe-level details than in the nitty
gritty of programming the controller; we need that too, but maybe some
of that can be addressed by code comments, e.g., the mutex could have
a one-line comment about avoiding races with RP resets via AER
recovery.
