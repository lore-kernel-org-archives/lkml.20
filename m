It's fine to ask for status once in a while, don't worry about it.
Common sense applies here of course. I.e. don't ask ever other day about
status :)

Ok, this sounds as a good candidate for a xfstests case.

you don't usually need to send the logs. If you have the reproducer,
just attach it to the message in text/plain with instructions how to
run. So we can try locally.

This is a good start, but as I'm suggesting everybody sending patches,
please ensure at least it passes -g auto group in xfstests. Not sure
what specific timeout you're talking about, but you can even run it
locally on your machine, for example with virtme-ng.

Ok, please send a V2 then, and we'll continue from there
