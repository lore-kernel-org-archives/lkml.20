Yes. We should use incremental baby steps to make the merge easier to
digest. I think grow only is fine.

Agree.

We can always add follow up patches if shrink proves useful; I really doubt=
 it.
We don't have to address all issues in one series. I actually advise
against lump too many patches into one series.
