I see now, sorry. Yes, I misread the code, and assumed the signal frame
has a matching shadow stack entry that includes the RIP check.

What do you think of creating a shadow stack frame on signal delivery
and popping that on sigreturn? I suppose that would need siglongjmp
modifications and probably break CRIU. :(

I wonder if there are real apps that abuse sigreturn as a forward edge.
If so, they should not be advertising their DSO as shstk-compatible.

Yes that seems a bit excessive to me. At least, the 64-bit path protects
against obviously forged signal frames, so maybe there is still a case
for the patch?
