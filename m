Really?  We average about 200-250 new contributors every kernel release
until recently when it's shot up to 600-700 if not more.  So we don't
seem to have a lack of new contributors for some reason...

If you think it is worth adding, sure, but normally we need someone to
actually care about it getting into the tree (i.e. real users
somewhere).  Also look at the bottom of the readme, shouldn't the
existing in-kernel driver just be tweaked for this hardware instead?
