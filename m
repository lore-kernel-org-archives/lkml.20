So as I see now there is a consensus that
1) it's good to have Intel related GPIO drivers to be in 'intel' folder;
2) the USB GPIO drivers are still a GPIO and should reside under drivers/gpio/ (somewhere beneath that, subfolder or not).

We do not have a consensus on:
1) PMIC separation to the 'intel/pmic' subfolder;
2) USB GPIO route for patches (with them still be somewhere under drivers/gpio/).

Unanswered question:
1) do we need to consider gpio-tps68470 (camera PMIC on Intel HW) as part of
'intel/pmic' or even 'intel' in general? Currently the Intel HW is the only
user of it.

P.S. It seems a big deal to move the drivers from one folder to another :-)
