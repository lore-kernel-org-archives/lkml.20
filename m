Thanks for your insights and clarification.

This is a very clear architecture for virtio-blk inline encryption support
and is quite similar to what I referred to as approach 1, with a few notable
differences:

  - The host maintains a set of virtual keyslots per virtio-blk device.
  - Physical keyslots are not statically partitioned.
  - The virtual-to-physical slot mapping is managed as part of the virtio-blk
    device implementation rather than being tied to a VM-wide slot table.

With this design, I believe there would be two VM exits associated with
encrypted I/O:
  1. Key programming
     Before encrypted I/O can be submitted, the guest needs to program a key
     into a virtual keyslot:
     
     Guest virtio-blk driver
         -> VM exit
         -> virtio-blk backend (e.g. QEMU)
         -> ioctl
         -> host virtio-blk proxy driver
            (stores the blk_crypto_key in a virtual keyslot)

  2. Encrypted I/O submission
     The I/O request carries the virtual keyslot number and DUN:

     Guest virtio-blk driver
        -> VM exit
        -> virtio-blk backend (e.g. QEMU)
        -> ioctl
        -> host virtio-blk proxy driver
           (looks up the blk_crypto_key associated with the virtual keyslot
            and submits I/O using bio_crypt_set_ctx())

I have been wondering whether a model similar to the passthrough
blk-crypto-profile used by certain dm targets could be applicable here.

In such a design, ownership of keyslot management would effectively and totally
move to the host. The guest would no longer manage virtual keyslots, and the
host block layer would continue using its existing keyslot manager to allocate,
reuse, and evict physical keyslots as needed.

This corresponds to what I previously described as approach 2.
With this approach, encrypted I/O would require only a single VM exit:
  1. Encrypted I/O submission
     The I/O request carries the blk_crypto_key and DUN:

     Guest virtio-blk driver
        -> VM exit
        -> virtio-blk backend (e.g. QEMU)
        -> ioctl
        -> host virtio-blk proxy driver
           (receives the blk_crypto_key and DUN, then submits I/O using
            bio_crypt_set_ctx())

Regardless of which approach is used, the host would still need to maintain a
key lookup table so that the host blk-crypto layer consistently sees the same
blk_crypto_key object for a guest key until that key is evicted.

Note that, the key table format is
  - approach 1: <virtual_slot, blk_crypto_key>
  - approach 2: <hash_id of blk_crypto_key, blk_crypto_key>

Therefore, if transferring blk_crypto_key material from the guest to the host
(and from userspace to kernel space) is considered acceptable, I wonder whether
approach 2 might be preferable because it avoids virtual keyslots entirely and
reduces the encrypted I/O path to a single VM exit.

Do you see any major drawbacks with such an approach? In particular, do you
think reducing the number of VM exits by eliminating virtual keyslots is a
worthwhile direction for virtio-blk inline encryption support?
