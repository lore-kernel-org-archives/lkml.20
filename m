Ordering symmetry can be resolved by looking at (distance, abs(node_id_i - =
node_id_j)).

node distance is symmetric if you don't modify it.

I think you should get true affinity metric based on real distance. Bias ba=
sed on node
property can be applied separately and a easily controlled manner. =C2=A0Th=
at has the advantage
of setting the bias based on factors like load or others.

It is a bad design to have to tune a hacked up
distance to change the bias.  It is hard to control
the magnitude of the bias and use a similar and consistent
bias with the current approach. The distance you inject to
disambiguate is not the same from node to node.

I think the design can be much simplified if you don't have to invent a new
distance matrix.
