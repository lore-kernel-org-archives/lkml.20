Can you just work this out off-list? Let's keep the on-list dialogue
consolidated to a single series to review.

There's no such "can be promoted to writable on write" in the indirect
permission model. This is why I'm suggesting that we align the abstract
permission bits (i.e. KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_*) with the architecture's own
abstracted permissions (e.g. uX, pX, RO, RW).

That composes nicely with nested virt as it is unambiguous what
permissions we're trying to represent in a shadow stage-2. And in the
non-nested case you can just lay down writable-dirty translations for
most things and use writable-clean when necessary for HDBSS.

There's a bit more though. We need to have an entry in S2PIR_EL2 that
encodes write permission and select that with PIIndex. So then we wind
up mapping the abstract WRITE permission bit to two fields into the
descriptor rather than 1.
