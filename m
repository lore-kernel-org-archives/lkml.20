I'm still struggling my way through this thing.

So thread T1 is doing this blocking syscall. When it actually blocks,
you hand-over the userspace identifying part to another thread T2, which
will return to userspace as if it were T1.

Is this really a hand-over, or a swap? I would imagine we not have two
threads with the same tid and all that.

Also, I'm a wee bit confused, why not swap out the kernel stack with a
io-wq worker and have the original thread return to userspace. This
seems like a better defined situation. In so far as anything here is
well defined.

Swapping the kernel state seems like a simpler endeavour than swapping
all that is or might be user visible.

That was the whole threadlet thing, right? Very hazy memories of that.
I'll have to go read that back, I'm sure I still have that in my inbox
*somewhere*.

Surely we abandoned that approach for a reason. ISTR there being some
significant ick there, much like the thing you're proposing now.

Not sure yet on how things compare. Will have to dig through that stuff
again.
