Hi Baoquan,

I am mainly trying to facilitate the discussion but your use of LLM is causing
more confusion. LLM use is fine but please at least re-read before sending that
the sentences flow and makes sense.

I am not getting how out of context above paragraph shows the conclusion about
dynamic growth/shrink and *no writeback*.

I don't see any evidense of this decision. Actually this whole email thread
shows that there is no such decision.

With dynamic growth/shrink, is this really a blocker?

Anyways, I will let Nhat and others discuss the technical details (unless I am
asked for it). My main reason to join the conversation is to converge the
discussion to a decision and resolution.
