Well, yes and no. In contrast with Generic Netlink, CTLV builds on
inheritance. So *every* CTLV family is child of "root" CTLV family. So
if user opens any /dev/ctlvX, the "root" CTLV family ops work. Then the
families-dump op reveals the inheritance chain from root to the leaf.
The idea is to allow generic tool to work on upper family level and
allowing some driver-specific tool to work on the leaf.
Think of it as a part of introspection of a device.

I don't think that the existance of family-dump prevents you that. I
have idea of a split that would allow you to attach CTVL ioctl on
existing fd. Will try to sketch it and implement it.

The node is not opaque before open, though. It is a device-model child
of the device that registered it, so /sys/class/ctlv/ctlv0/device
points at that parent, and its uevents carry the family and its
ancestry (CTLV_FAMILY, CTLV_COMPATIBLE_*).

udev can name it from the same properties. ctlv0 is no more stable
than sda or event3, and it gets a stable name the same way: a rule
matches the family or the parent and adds a symlink, as /dev/disk/by-id
does for disks, e.g.:

    SUBSYSTEM=="ctlv", ENV{CTLV_FAMILY}=="ctlv-attestation-tdx", \
        SYMLINK+="attestation/tdx"

A container is then given /dev/attestation/tdx rather than whichever
ctlvN it happened to get; no special tooling is involved. The Discovery
section later in the doc has the details.

Netlink actually does not have it. Attr id is not global as it is here.

There are no frags on the request side (reply has them).
The entire message is a single buf. For request, all arrays are bounded
and this is enforced for every family attribute. The introspection
provides kernel-computed max size of buffer for ever op request.
Then during processing, kernel copies the whole request buffer before it
parses it.

I deliberatelly made this limitation to keeps things simple. Makes
sense?

Yes it is a limitation of ordering of attributes that occur multiple
times in message/nest (arrays). Will reword.

Okay, will reword.
