Mikhail, this can't work for upstreaming.  You expanded your series in
the very last day of the 7.3 quite significantly.  That makes all
patches mandatory to be reviewed again, and it means that it's not for
7.4 but for 7.5 in the next year.

And for 7.5 stuff, now is the worst time for review, as the merge
window for 7.4 was opened today.  So either have patience for the
future, or try to fit with the kernel development cycle.


thanks,

Takashi
