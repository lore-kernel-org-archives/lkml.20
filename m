I am simply doing what I think it's best for these devices and
I have explained my reasoning.

The fact that the device is not being built anymore by asus
(I am not sure it's EoL) plays little role. No kernel rule
prevents that nor I have seen any reference. We support
what is in active usage by people and these devices are.

Well I find this phrasing needlessly aggressive and there is
absolutely zero reason to behave like this.

This is a capture from windows of the 2023 version, mine
is identical:
https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/reverse-engineering/-/tree/master/xg_mobile?ref_type=heads

I obviously already tried setting the kbd backlight quirk
and nothing happens, in fact I asked this capture right
because aura was a no-go.

The device I have here, the 2022 model and the 2023 are
not aura devices. They ignore aura commands as well as
everything else previously known.
