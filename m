Yeah, it is.  I can't think why someone would ask for that either, but
equally it's more work to explicitly have a list of combinations we
reject for policy reasons.  At least on arm64 each permission just comes
down to a separate bit in a control register so they're fully
independent all the way down to the hardware.

They'd rather have just a size control for that, probably a process wide
control would be most useful since it's likely to be the same number for
all threads.  I suspect the main use casse would be someone trying to do
green threads, where there's an extra real thread being created.
