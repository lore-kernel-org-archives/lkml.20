I do remember that you've said about this a few times.

I meditated for a while before answering.

It's best to not do what I've done or try to fix it. Nothing works;
neither me nor the process...

I'll start faithfully writing cover letters progressively on side
while reviewing. That resolves about 75% of "what words to use"
and that type of stuff.

I mean I'm also right now zeroing my hard effort from code reviews
by not writing down the facts when they are still are fresh.

I'll change it to:

"[GIT PULL] TPM DEVICE DRIVER changes for vX.Y.Z-rcW"

I'll do exactly what said above I will do, which I hope will equal to
that :-)
