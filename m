You could do use a commit hash that is still in a maintainer tree.  I also
sometimes do so.  But in the case it is better to explicitly mention it is for
squashing on mm-unstable.  And if it was the intention, in this patch series,
you were better to split the kunit patch.

Thank you for clarifying, Karl.  I was initially tempted to keep what I did
(option 2), but maybe that's only because I am too lazy.  Let's do squash.
Unless others raise other opinion, I will repost patch 1 with updated commit
message tomorrow.

I will keep patch 2 in damon/next and repost for mm.git merge as I explained in
the earlier reply.


Thanks,
SJ
