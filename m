I guess that's because the LRU is not always accurate. There are cases
where our prediction of future access patterns may be wrong, resulting
in refaults?

Even on Android, which uses zram with very fast synchronous swap-out,
I can still hit the swapcache from time to time. So perhaps with a
slower device, such as an HDD, keeping the swapcache around for longer
could allow applications to hit it more often?

I don't know. Maybe Alexandre can share more details about this
benchmark. I'm also a little surprised by the 15% regression in
Sysbench OLTP. My initial feeling was the same as yours: we should
release the memory immediately after writeback completes, for both
synchronous and asynchronous I/O.

Kairui also mentioned to me that he once tried releasing memory
immediately after folios were written back to HDD, and saw some
serious performance regressions as well. Maybe Kairui can also share
some thoughts on this.
