I'll be glad to taint if driver_override is also written to, but it's
bind() that triggers the actual action happening.  Or so the traces
show.

We support PCI devices being removed, but that falls under the PCI
hotplug rules/requirements, right?  Anyway, sure, we can fix those bugs
when found, but that's not the majority of what we are seeing at the
moment.  Look at all of the dumb platform drivers that are getting hit
with this on the syzbot reports...

I don't understand what you mean by this.

it's not going to be ignored if panic_on_taint is enabled in syzbot,
which the authors have said they will do :)
