Hi Jisheng,

Thanks for the feedback.

Regarding the comparison with other architectures, thanks to Michael
Ellerman for pointing me to the PowerPC TLB tracing when we happened
to discuss this at LPC 2026.

PowerPC defines the powerpc:tlbie and powerpc:tlbia trace events in
arch/powerpc/include/asm/trace.h, and the corresponding trace calls
are used in the PowerPC TLB invalidation paths.

These events are not identical to the proposed RISC-V event: the
PowerPC events primarily describe architecture invalidation
operations, whereas this patch records the path selected by Linux
before dispatch. However, I think they provide useful precedent for
architecture-specific TLB observability beyond x86.

Regarding kprobes, I agree that dynamic tracing can be used to investigate =
this.

My concern is that obtaining the same information requires knowledge
of the current implementation and reconstruction of the decision made
inside __flush_tlb_range() / flush_tlb_all().

For example, probing __flush_tlb_range() gives us the incoming
request, but does not directly tell us whether Linux selected the
local flush, SBI RFENCE, or cross-CPU-call path. A tracing tool has to
probe and correlate implementation-specific downstream functions, or
reproduce the selection logic itself.

The proposed event records this semantic decision directly at the
point where Linux makes it. Users therefore do not need to depend on
the current helper names, call graph, or exact implementation of the
selection logic.

Regarding the tracepoint overhead issue, I agree that disabled-path
overhead is important, especially in the TLB flush path.

However, I see the referenced SBI tracepoint case primarily as a
RISC-V compiler/code-generation issue rather than as an argument
against providing this kind of observability.

The referenced discussion itself shows that the generated code depends
significantly on compiler behavior, and that this is an area being
improved. The undesirable overhead is not an inherent semantic
requirement of the tracepoint.

Even if the same code-generation problem currently affects this
tracepoint, I don't think a temporary compiler limitation should by
itself determine whether the tracepoint is useful or whether this
observability belongs in the kernel.

If the compiler currently generates unacceptable disabled-path
overhead, that is certainly something that should be improved or
mitigated in the implementation. But I would separate that issue from
the question of whether exposing the RISC-V TLB path-selection
decision is useful.

In other words, I see the code-generation issue as an implementation
concern, while the tracepoint itself provides information that
otherwise has to be reconstructed from implementation details using
dynamic tracing.

Thanks,
Roman
