I afraid that you over optimistic about the amount of work.

Maybe I'm wrong, and everything will work out. However, given Christian's
feedback to determine the mapping type when the mapping is established, this
approach won't work for an RDMA exporter.

As I mentioned, mlx5 uses on-demand paging (ODP), creating mappings in
response to page faults. To handle these faults with reasonable performance,
mlx5 must create a memory region (MR), with or without ATS, and it is
needed to be created before first page fault.

I'm afraid we're going in circles, so I'll drop the dma-buf patches for now
and focus on fixing only the PCI ATS flow.
