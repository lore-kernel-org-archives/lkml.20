If this file isn't relevant to the PCI core, maybe we don't need to
mention it here.  It doesn't seem like it motivates this patch.

So IIUC this part of the path looks like this, which answers my
question below about ordering of pci_ser and
pci_liveupdate_preserve():

              fh->ops->preserve                   # eg vfio_pci_liveupdate_preserve()
                vfio_pci_liveupdate_preserve
                  pci_liveupdate_preserve
                    pci_liveupdate_preserve_device
                      dev_ser = pci_flb_alloc_dev_ser  <-- alloc per-dev PCI core serialized state
                      dev_ser->bdf = pci_dev_id(dev)

It seems like pci_ser is a singleton by design, so a global variable
doesn't sound like it would be terrible to me.

Could we say something specific and PCI-related here, to help connect
the dots?  Most of these paths are outside the PCI core.

IIUC luo_session essentially has a refcount (outgoing.count)
incremented by each LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD ioctl, and the 0->1
transition in luo_flb_file_preserve_one() ends up calling
pci_flb_preserve(), where pci_ser is allocated.

And the refcount is decremented by luo_flb_file_unpreserve() (in a
luo_session .release() function), where the 1->0 transition in
liveupdate_flb_put_outgoing() calls pci_flb_unpreserve() where pci_ser
is deallocated.

That gets into a lot of detail, probably too much for a commit log.
Maybe mentioning the function names by which the PCI core is notified
to alloc/free pci_ser would be enough of a bread crumb.

I think the updated call tree above shows the connection?
