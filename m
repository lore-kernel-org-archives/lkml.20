Hehe, well that's what v2 is for :)

To be clear: dropping a reference is not the point at which we extend
the timer -- it's simply the point at which we propagate the last_busy
timestamp.

The naive algorithm is:
Every time a device updates its last_busy, sync that timestamp to all
its dependencies.

My proposal modifies that naive algorithm so that it avoids additional
graph walks -- it defers that "sync" step until later. (Now that I'm
spelling this out, I feel like I should have included this in the commit
message...)

With that said:

But that's not what I'm doing: I'm not calling mark_last_busy() -- I'm
just making mark_last_busy() transitive to all dependencies. So any time
we *already* say the child is busy, I also extend that to the parent --
I'm not generating any new timestamps; I only reuse the timestamps we
already selected.

My view on the logic (using your terms above): when a child calls
mark_last_busy(), it suggests that child might be needed in the near
future. Whenever a child device is needed, so is its parent (barring
ignore_children). Thus, mark_last_busy() should also refresh the
parent's busy timestamp.

Importantly (in the same topic Jonathan was already asking about): this
does *not* mean the parent gets a whole new autosuspend delay period --
but it *does* mean that if the parent has a longer delay period
(presumably because it has a more expensive/slow suspend/resume latency)
it waits a bit longer (in case the child wakes back up, for one) to
autosuspend.

In concrete terms of commit c537d3457542 ("iio: adc: stm32-adc: fix
runtime autosuspend delay when slow polling"):

 * child device has 100ms delay
 * parent devices has 2s delay

SEQUENCE:
 1) child is active for longer than 2 seconds
 2) [timestamp N] child finishes I/O, drops reference with put_autosuspend()
 3) [N + 100ms] child suspends

CURRENT BEHVIOR:
 4) [N + 100ms] parent suspends immediately after #3

PROPOSAL:
 4) [N + 2s] parent suspends (if there was no other last_busy update)

The only last_busy timestamp is N; we just use it in more places,
because the parent was, in fact, busy at timestamp N.

"Direct reference" is to mean "pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()" or anything
similar that updates last_busy. We expect that when the device in
question is the target object for I/O or whatever is keeping the device
busy.

But if the I/O is performed by a child, then it's no longer "direct
reference" -- it's "usage accounted by its children".

I think I've improperly directed you to focus on the "reference" part,
which IMO is a bit of a distraction. The point is: when was the device
"busy" (or "last used")? The 'control' attribute does not represent
"last used"; it just represents some unrelated policy to prevent
suspension.

Note: stm32-adc-core (drivers/iio/adc/stm32-adc-core.c) is the parent.
stm32-adc (drivers/iio/adc/stm32-adc.c) is the child.

When the child suspends, the parent checks .runtime_idle(). This updates
last_busy but still falls through to autosuspend -- that means we get a
slightly suboptimal sequence like the following:

 1) child is active for longer than 2 seconds
 2) [timestamp N] child finishes I/O, drops reference with put_autosuspend()
 3) [N + 100ms] child suspends
 4) parent runtime_idle() updates last_busy to [P = approx N + 100ms]
 5) [P + 2s] parent suspends

Step 5 happens approximately 100ms later than it really should, but it's
good enough.

NB: I think this is also why greybus (gb_bundle_idle(),
gb_interface_runtime_idle(), etc.) and USB (usb_runtime_idle(),
dwc3_runtime_idle()) look the way they do, with a built-in
mark_last_busy() in runtime_idle().

I also think that some other areas could use some logic like this. For
example, drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv.c has a 100ms autosuspend delay so
that lspci doesn't cause repeated suspend/resume. But suppose config
access for a child of a port are slow ... then the port still might
suspend immediately, between config accesses. (Never mind that
pci_config_pm_runtime_put() doesn't update last_busy...)

I think that's an area I could improve in the commit message. But see my
comments above ("My view on the logic") which I hope answers your
question.

OK. If we agree on the what and why, I'll take another pass at this. For
one, I imagine describing the "naive algorithm" I mention above would be
a good start. And maybe the principles below.

Which part do you not like? The loop? The use of compare/exchange?

The principles involved are:

1) copy the timestamp
2) avoid going backward in time (e.g., if target already updated to a
   newer stamp)
3) avoid TOCTOU races between reading the target stamp and replacing it
   (e.g., if multiple children are doing this at the same time)

I suppose I could compromise on #3 by only doing a single
compare/exchange. This would remove the looping (which is admittedly a
little hard to reason about), at the expense of getting a suboptimal
update in the (likely rare) case of concurrent updates.
