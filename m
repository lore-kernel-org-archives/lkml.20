With the help of AI:

it can't block — it's a drain, not a wait. set_term_quiet_input()
(util/term.c) puts the terminal in raw mode with VMIN = 0; VTIME = 0, so
read() returns 0 when there is nothing typed; the while (read(...) == 1)
loop drains what was typed and returns to the progress callback, which
returns to libdebuginfod, which carries on fetching and calls it again
at the next update. When the fetch finishes there are no more callbacks.

But then there are other issues in that series, from Ian, and from
myself, locally, I'll submit a new version soon.
