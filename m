First, note that "PM domain" is not a synonym for "power domain".

A PM domain is essentially a set of PM callbacks that are invoked by
the PM core for the devices the PM domain is attached to instead of
their bus type callbacks.

There can be only one PM domain attached to a device at any time and
the idea is that it will amend driver PM callbacks with whatever is
needed to power manage the device from the platform or board
perspective.

For example, the ACPI PM domain uses ACPI power management (which is
based on platform-specific and board-specific information) to amend
platform driver PM callbacks.  In the presence of the ACPI PM domain,
platform device drivers may expect the devices to be ready to use at
probe time and to be turned off after driver removal.

When genpd was introduced, the idea was that it would work in analogy
with the ACPI PM domain, but I'm not sure if and to what extent that
is the case now.

Anyway, in the absence of a PM domain, the driver is responsible for
doing all of the PM-related work which may make a difference at least
in some cases.

I think that this would be somewhat better or at least less confusing.

Well, your basic example needs to be put in a certain context because
it may not be generally applicable everywhere.

I think that you should make it clear what the driver's expectations
regarding the physical state of the device at the probe time are and
the general rule is that it is better to leave the device in the same
state in which it is expected to be found next time.

I'm not quite convinced that runtime PM is suitable for devm_ type of
management.

IIRC, devm_pm_runtime_enable() was introduced to avoid some code
duplication between drivers, but I don't think that it may be expected
to be universally applicable.

Certainly, helpers that cover sufficiently common scenarios and help
to avoid code duplication are useful, but it needs to be clear when
exactly they are applicable and to what extent.

You may say "operational" to refer to a state in which the device is
accessible and functional, which should also be the case when the
device is "active" from the runtime PM perspective.

I've tried to explain that above.
