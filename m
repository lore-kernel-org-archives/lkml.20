I allowed callers/users to manage the buffers because I didn't have a
confidence at maanging the buffers in a good way.  But I now think it was not a
good design choice.

First of all, it is offloading decision to users.  I also feel like this design
exposes too much internal implementation details to users.  It would be better
to let DAMON just manage it.  If it turns out to be too suboptimal, we can
later consider optimizing it and even let users control it if really needed.

Letting M:N reports:queue routing makes it quite complicated, too. 

So, unless others object, I will change the design to hide the report buffers
management from users.

My initial plan was to implement the above per-CPU write monitoring with the
milestone 2 patch series.  That's mainly because we don't want to have an API
without its callers.  But implementing perf cycle sampling would be no small
amount of code that require extensive tests.  It may take time and make the
patch series quite big.  I'm now trying to make it small and quick.

I find this report infrastructure could also be used for direct user reports.
That is, users might know which memory they are accessing, and want to ensure
DAMON knows that, by reporting their information using the report infra.  I
will expose an ABI for such direct user report, and connect it with the
reporting infra.  That would look similar to that of DAMOS quota goal
user_input metric.  I will continue implementing perf cpu cycle based report
producer implementation on top of it.  But maybe we could also just call the
user report as milestone 2, as there will be no more blockers for other works
like AMD IBS support.

Unless I get concerns on above plan, I will update this design patch and write
user ABI documents.  I will share those as RFC v0.1, and keep iterating the
documentation-only patches for continued design discussion until I get a
confidence in the interface design.

FYI, damon/next [1] tree may have hacky changes that could significantly be
changed in future.  Please don't rely on those.  Don't spend time on reviewing
those.  I sometimes regret I should named it 'damon/hack'.  Anyway, I will
share things that ready to be reviewed on this mailing list.
