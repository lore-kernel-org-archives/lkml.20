I'm afraid I do no have time to do that myself. With that said
I do think this is a good idea. For privacy reasons (bugzilla
email addresses or not really public) this should probably be
done through a comment in the relevant bugzilla tickets.

This depends in your reading of what an MMIO reservation in the EFI memmap
actually means. Some BIOSes put an MMIO reservation over the entire
PCI bridge window. So there an MMIO reservation basically means
"this is MMIO not RAM" it does not mean "do not touch".

> Our ("collective") goal should be to get rid of unscable tech debt not add more that's even harder to peel back.

I complete agree, but 07eab0901ede was added exactly to do that, well to
not need to end an endless amount of quirks. I'm afraid reverting it
will cause lots of breakage putting users off of using Linux and if we
end up fixing all that breakage with quirks this may result in lots of
quirks.

We know the issue worked-around by 07eab0901ede was seen on many laptop
models. Where as the current problem so far has only shown on Genoa.

Note I'm not necessarily against reverting 07eab0901ede I'm just trying
to get across that this is a tricky issue. When we hit the issue which
lead to 07eab0901ede I spend weeks going through bug-reports / dmesg
outputs to try and come up with a solution.

Anyway I've said what I want to say and this time around I do not have
a whole lot of time to spend on this issue, so I which you all the best
of luck with whatever approach you chose.

Regards,

Hans
