This error handling belongs to the host, guest can't understand.

This is actually DOE error according to GHCI spec.

The above 3 errors indicate the link is broken. Guest could handle them
by unplugging the device. But there are always link broken events at any
time, host should handle them, guest can expect a notification from host
to do the unplugging. That's another topic.

So for TSM operations, guest kernel just keep the TDISP state unchanged
and report error to user.

BTW: UNLOCK is not needed when link is broken. So always good to let
UNLOCK succeed.

> 	TDISP_MESSAGE_ERROR

These 2 are about TDISP, guest can keep the state machine unchanged, and
report error to user. According to TDISP spec, UNLOCK can't fail on
these 2 errors.

For LOCK/RUN/GET_DEV_INFO/GET_TDI_REPORT, I agree.

For UNLOCK, guest kernel could always return success. We are always safe
to move the device to untrusted mode.

The secure firmware should guarantee the attack can't impact TSM
security. For DDOS attack, the guest could always move the device to
untrusted mode.
