If I am not mistaken, you're talking about what's described in the
section labelled "Interleaved-transfer mode" of the document you
provided previously?

> The constraints that led to this approach are in the following thread:

That to me seemed like a discussion about why the MDF/interleaver needs
to be represented as a separate device, I don't see anything that
explains why the MDF cannot be a backend.

Reading the document, "Interleaved-transfer mode" doesn't trash the
association between data and which fifo, and thereby which sensor or
ADC, it came from. Using #io-backend-cells =3D <1> in the MDF, the
sensor/ADC can provide the channel to which it is linked, and the data
association restored. You already know what the set of interleaved channels
is from the st,interleave property so there's no extra properties required
for this I think.

The problem here must be that you want to access the interleaved data? That
could be handled by having a cell value that represents the interleaved
data (e.g. -1), rather than a channel (1-N)? That'd support systems that
want interleaved data (like an array of identical sensors?) and systems
using the mode for the stated aim of it in documentation of optimising
DMA request resources who have disparate devices where interleaved data
itself is not useful?

Thanks,
Conor.
