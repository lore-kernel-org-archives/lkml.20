In preparation for removing duplicate documentation from
Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst, borrow some of the useful wording
from runtime_pm.rst, and update other language for clarity, ease of
reading, and completeness.

Other guiding principles in this change:

 * Try to highlight "core", as in, "functions that are not for driver
   use but are exported because the real entrypoints are inline
   functions"

 * Rework pm_runtime_barrier() docs significantly. More below.

 * Include some clarifying cross-references and recommendations for
   pm_runtime_put_sync{,_suspend,_autosuspend}()

 * Attempt to deemphasize some of the implementation details (e.g.,
   "asynchronous" instead of "queue")

 * Try for more clear user-facing language. For example, "set up
   autosuspend" isn't quite clear whether we're configuring autosuspend,
   or if we're initiating an attempt to autosuspend (i.e., setting a
   timer).

pm_runtime_barrier(): currently, we speak a lot about implementation
details and sequences of events, but obscure the key point that it
treats "pending resume" and "pending suspend" very differently -- I try
to improve that.
