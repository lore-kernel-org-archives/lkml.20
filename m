I don't consider myself versed in the ways of the KVM MMU, it took me
a few minutes to track this done, so I think it's okay.

Nested virtualization on Intel is probably more popular than AMD at
this point, so my gut feeling is that we shouldn't block on fixing
this. But I agree we shouldn't feel free to break it either. Will wait
for Sean or David to chime in before deciding the way forward, but if
there's a fix it would be separate from this series imo anyway.
