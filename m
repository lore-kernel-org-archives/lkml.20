Subject: [PATCH 04/12] perf debuginfo: Let the user skip and disable debuginfod fetches

From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

When a fetch is in progress, the way it prints progress is how one
gets out of it: 's' aborts the current fetch via the debuginfod
client's progress callback protocol and remembers the build ID, so
that the rest of the session doesn't ask for it again, the user may
have skipped it for being too big; 'd' additionally disables debuginfod
for the rest of the session, clearing DEBUGINFOD_URLS so that libdwfl's
own client, that reads it in every query, stops fetching too, and, using
perf_config__set_variable(), moved to util/config.c in the previous
patch, writes core.debuginfod=false to the configuration file directly,
the user's ~/.perfconfig or the one named by PERF_CONFIG, the same
rewrite 'perf config' does -- the comments are not preserved, as the
config set carries just the key-value pairs -- and SIGINT, SIGQUIT and
SIGTERM are intercepted while the terminal is in raw mode, so that it is
restored and the signal is re-raised when the user interrupts a fetch.

In the TUI nothing is shown yet, printing to stderr would garble the
browser display and draining stdin would eat the keys the browser
wants, that comes in the next patch.

The interaction state -- the terminal settings, the signal dispositions
and the progress and cancellation state -- is process global, so the
fetches stay serialized: a second fetch resetting the cancellation
state would drop the 's'/'d' keypress that was meant for the fetch
already in progress, and the serialization the lookup state needs
already provides the lock the interaction state uses.

Since the debuginfo fetching this builds on is opt-out, a fetch that
the user asked to skip is not restarted by the next request for the
same build ID in the same session, it is remembered as a cancellation
on the misses list, where the debug message can tell it apart from a
plain miss.
