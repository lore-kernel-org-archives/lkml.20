I understand that QEMU-virt is not intended to model a realistic
production platform and that QEMU-SBSA is generally preferred. However,
I sometimes use QEMU-virt to test functionality quickly because it runs
slightly faster than QEMU-SBSA.

I tested this series with QEMU-virt and found that RMM initialization
failed during boot:

  [...]
  INFO:    BL31: Initializing RMM
  INFO:    RMM init start.
  ERROR:   RMM init failed: -8
  WARNING: BL31: RMM initialization failed

The following TF-A revision was used:
  https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git master (38269bb)

After investigating, I found that the failure was caused by the lack of
a plat_rmmd_reserve_memory() implementation for the QEMU-virt platform
in TF-A. Adding an implementation equivalent to the QEMU-SBSA one
resolved the issue:
    https://git.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/+/9d594743aa4d4e8160cdf025ea7538041648972c

Is QEMU virt still intended to be supported as an RME emulation
platform? In particular, is this functionality simply not implemented
yet, or is there a reason why RME support is not planned for QEMU virt?

If this is not the appropriate place to discuss this, please let me
know :)

Thanks,
Kohei
