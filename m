I think I was mistaken here:  the reference is moved to the file table 
by dma_buf_fd(), and seems another thread could immediately close it.

If so, there's an opportunity for userspace to (after this fix) cause a 
NULL deref here.

I'm about to repost the series but am happy to include a oneliner third 
patch to mitigate this, if you feel appropriate.

Is file_count() still interesting here, i.e. do you expect it to be >1 
immediately after export?  If still required, reading 
file_count(dmabuf->file) before the dma_buf_fd() would be safe (printing 
it later at the existing place).
