The traditional things that admit EINTR in close are bad NFS
implementations (which intentionally use interruptible instead of
killable because network flaky) and tape drives (which at least
historically performed rewinding as part of the close operation).

You don't want a slow close blocking delivery of SIGALRM either.
Freezing the process during a long close is not the answer. The answer
is just getting rid of long close and having it behave properly as a
resource-handle-free-only operation and return immediately. But that's
a more invasive change than just replacing -EINTR with 0 if/when it
gets interrupted.
