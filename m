I get your point here and actually keep this in mind. Did not
cross my mind by I get where this is coming from.

The logic translates easily to some other data structure if
this comes up again.

I will do a full rewrite. I don't get anything out of that either
other than there's a lot of text.

LLMs honestly are incredibly bad documenting anything.

It does not and yeah I consider the options. I'll also go through
structs declared and do at least best effort in ordering as per
memory alignment (if possible only tail padding).

And in general I check where I could use cleanup.h more. I keep
this mind :-)

I fully got this and agree.

With quick skim, I agree. Thanks for the snippet!

Hey, this was very useful, thanks. I've already polished the patch where
I see low-hanging fruit. I've split the bug fixes perhaps a bit over the
top because I've noticed that unchecked LLM bug fixes are surpsingly
often not that great. They are often short circuited to the nearest 
surface, instead of thinking the overall vector.

I go all comments through that are added or modified. Especially with
LLM originated code it is a one place to do a sanity check for yourself
whether you are actually reading the code or not.

LLMs feel in kernel development more like a power tool than an
assistant. I can make big holes fast but that does not take care of the
"precission work".

Br, Jarkko
