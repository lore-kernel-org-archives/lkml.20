Ok, makes sense.  The user impact should be not that big, though.

Sounds like a big change compared to the problem.  Why we cannot modify the
last region case?  Have you also considered other possible simpler approaches?

Thank you for clarifying.  Please try to reduce this kind of false positives
from the next time.

What's the problem and benefit?  I still don't get it.  More clarification
would be nice.
