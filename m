coresight: etm4x: exclude ss_status from drvdata->config

The purpose of TRCSSCSRn register is to show status of the corresponding
Single-shot Comparator Control and input supports. This patch excludes
ss_status from drvdata->config and moves it directly into drvdata. It also
intentionally preserves existing behavior for single-shot events within the
same session.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does this loop in etm4_enable_hw() blindly
rely on the uncapped hardware count caps->nr_ss_cmp? If the hardware report=
s a
value larger than the statically sized array (8 elements), could this resul=
t in
an out-of-bounds access to the ss_status array in kernel memory?

[Severity: Medium]
Is there a potential data race here in etm4_enable_hw()? This patch moves
ss_status to the global drvdata structure, making it shared state. It appea=
rs
this modifies the array without acquiring drvdata->spinlock, which could ra=
ce
with concurrent sysfs operations like sshot_ctrl_store() modifying the same
array.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this overwrite the shared ss_status array from hardware in
etm4_disable_hw() without acquiring drvdata->spinlock? A concurrent sysfs
write could clobber these updates.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does this read a trace regis=
ter
at offset 0x2A0 after power removal has been requested? In etm4_disable_hw(=
),
the trace unit power-up request (TRCPDCR_PU) is cleared prior to this loop.

According to the architecture specification, software must not access any t=
race
registers outside the management registers after TRCPDCR.PU is cleared, whi=
ch
could lead to a system hang or unpredictable behavior.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does this initialization loop in
etm4_init_arch_data() blindly rely on the uncapped hardware count
caps->nr_ss_cmp? Because drvdata->ss_status is a statically sized 8-element
array, could an unusually large hardware value cause an out-of-bounds write
here?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does this write in
sshot_ctrl_store() use a potentially out-of-bounds idx to access the
undersized ss_ctrl and ss_status arrays?

Since user input for the index in sshot_idx_store() is bounded to the hardw=
are
capability count rather than the software array boundary, could an attacker
use sysfs to trigger an out-of-bounds write resulting in kernel memory
corruption?

[Severity: Medium]
While the spinlock is held here in sshot_ctrl_store(), does it adequately
protect drvdata->ss_status if concurrent trace sessions in etm4_enable_hw()
and etm4_disable_hw() modify this shared status array without acquiring the
lock?
