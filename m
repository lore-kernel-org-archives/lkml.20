Thank you. Really appriciate that.

Ack, that is why I am against making it a special device. That is the
whole idea behind xswap. It is just normal swap device implemented via
swap_ops just like ext4 is a file system implemnet on top of VFS.

That is a careful design choice. Keep in mind that design choice
usually has pros and cons.

I will follow your feedback here.

I am not sure I follow. Are you referring to the uncompressible pages
that xswap would have to reject?

One way to address that is for xswap to just bite the bullet and store
the uncompressible pages within xswap. That way it will stay out of
the reclaim LRU. Zswap also stores some uncompressible pages. The last
time I checked, it was unfortunately not able to serve my case but
perfect for yours.

If xswap needs the lower tier it can allocate for one. I don't think
xswap should need to have swap_is_xswap() there. Also xswap does not
have all the baggage of zswap.writeback enable interface.

This will be addressed by the swap tiers series if it is not delayed.
This should be addressed in the core swap layer not vswap. Kairui also
has some ideas to improve that. Yes, it is a problem area, but it is
not specific to xswap. We are well aware of it and have plans to
improve it.

Baoquan's writeback series is out. It is by no means perfect. But it
is much closer to what I have in mind. That is a much better base to
work on.

Yes, I already read your code I decide that most of the
swap_is_vswap() should not be needed if taking a proper swap_ops
approach. I wanted to offer you the chance to work closely with me to
achieve that, but you did not follow that suggestion.

Quote from my old email:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CACePvbX+3tO91BmRwaLqf3Xia32GCemt3W8tayErG81BYL=
grzA@mail.gmail.com/

"I am happy to spend some time working with you to discuss the generic
adopted version of vswap, if you are open to it. Or if you don't want
to waste time on it. I can have someone else or myself come up with
the generic adopted version of vswap for you to review, which I prefer
less."

Anyway, Baoquan's xswap writeback patch series is out. I suggest
following and improving that series instead.

I like universal interfaces. Your vswap will break the /etc/fstab. The
current suggestion for xswap using sysfs will break that as well.
I would like to keep the /etc/fstab interface working, including
support for UUIDs for swap devices, etc.
I am very concerned that vswap will start kicking in without me
explicitly enabling it. That changes the previous user-visible
behavior. It breaks my mental model. Please take this feedback
seriously.

It is a different design philosophy to adopt a swap device to
implement VFS-like file systems for swap, making them swap file
systems.
Just like all file systems have a superblock so you can probe what
file system it is. You don't get a special sysfs interface for each
different file system to create them.
This aligns neatly with swap ops and makes room for future
flash-friendly swap file systems for example.

That is why I feel your patch series are really unclean. I dislike
special cases, I try to avoid them as much as possible.
