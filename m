Hi Leo,

Yes, that's exactly the simpler fix, and it's what I already did in
HDBSS v5 patch 2 — the folio is marked dirty for any write-permitting
mapping, so a read fault on a tracked memslot also marks it.

Since patch 2 covers this, patch 5 isn't needed. I'll drop it in the 
next version.

Thanks,
Tian
