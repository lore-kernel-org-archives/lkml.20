Sorry this patch feels like AI schlopp.

Please read https://docs.kernel.org/process/generated-content.html
especially:

	If tools permit you to generate a contribution automatically,
	expect additional scrutiny in proportion to how much of it was
	generated.

	As with the output of any tooling, the result may be incorrect or
	inappropriate. You are expected to understand and to be able to
	defend everything you submit. If you are unable to do so, then do
	not submit the resulting changes.

	If you do so anyway, maintainers are entitled to reject your series
	without detailed review.

You are changing a very subtle and fragile part of the kernel, and you seem
to be an absolute newcomer to mm.

In general we expect newcomers to mm to do smaller work and gradually work
their way up towards larger changes.

I think it's best to treat this as a report rather than a patch, and for a
member of the core team to take this over. I'll take a look.

Thanks!

(Review for below as reference only).

This could really do with a diagram and a simple explanation.

In general you should rewrite the entire commit message yourself and not
use the LLM output at all.

This is useless description of the code in English, it's not telling me
anything useful at all. Human beings don't have a large 'stack' with which
to hold things in our minds.

Write with humans in mind please :)

I don't understand what inferring the case means? I think this can be
dropped.

I mean what?

What does a 'possibly stale sort key' mean? And what does 'across the
caller's endpoint updates' mean? Which caller? What's an endpoint? What
updates?

Re-keys what? WHat does re-key mean?

What you're saying here really makes me nervous. You're changing a very
sensitive part of the kernel and talking about intentionally leaving stale
state around.

This patch cannot possibly be considered for upstream until I fully
understand exactly what this means and that you understand what you're
doing.

This is really unconvincing I'm sorry. Real numbers please with statistical
evidence to back them.

Additionally I notice you have not made one comment referring to locking
anywhere.

This part of the kernel has VERY subtle and sensitive locking
requirements. I am not convinced you understand this, either.

This patch feels like a hack. You are creating a whole new set of very
fragile assumptions that have to be maintained throughout.

Again as above, a member of the core team should take this over.

Please don't do this.

Upstream is not interested in private reviews. Review tags upstream are
based on review done in _public_.

Thank you for acking.

Again this is a bunch of unnecesary text that is explaining implementation
details and very typical of LLM comments.

This is completely useless. Don't write comments like this please.

Having written a lot of LLM-assisted code now in my build speedup series I
understand that responsible use of an LLM involves a _lot_ of human work
checking and auditing and ensuring understanding.

Please do make sure you do this part, it is not optional.

Is it safe to arbitrarily perform a 'propagate' at any time within the
interval tree?

I didn't notice any comment about locks or when this can or cannot be done?

vma_prepare() is called before performing the work that actually performs
the underlying operation ON THE ASSUMPTION that the VMA is correctly
removed from the tree.

So this would require some strong set of requirements to establish that it
is safe.

What does re-key me? Please don't invent new terminology :)

Not a kdoc, you're writing implementation details in the comment, this
feels like noise.

This doesn't seem to be differentiating against file? There's nothing here
about file.

And 'keeps rmap key'? What key? What do you mean?

'abuts' :) this is not helpful to non-native speakers and is rather an
obscure turn of phrase for native speakers, even.

Sorry this is just another horrible LLM-generated comment.

And it's totally unacceptable to write 'rules' into comments like this or
to say 'if a future xxx'.

This is not good :) we musn't set traps for ourselves like this.

No, you don't make assumptions like this in the code that can explode

This is not great, it doesn't explain anything.
