Nice. I hope that lands.  Not being in a sensible position to cherry-pick
off the start of a series is leading to a lot more patches outstanding
on list than I like.  I was drawing up a list of asks but seems folk
are already on top of them!

As a temporary solution this is fine.

Given my goldfish brain I can't remember if I reviewed much of this
recently so I'll just start at the top again!

Thanks

Jonathan
