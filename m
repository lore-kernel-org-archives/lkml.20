Understood.

So I suppose you're not wanting to do this for the actual placement=20
algorithm then because of the same risk but only cover the case where FW=20
placed 64-bit non-pref BAR into prefetchable window like this patch=20
currently does?

=2E..And limiting to that case only likely implies remove + rescan cycle ma=
y=20
fail because resources can no longer be placed into the same windows=20
which will surprise user (arguably, not the most common use case but=20
definitely surprising for the user if the kernel cannot place the=20
resources the same way they were after boot =3D> another way to get problem=
=20
reports).

(Unrelated to this change, I'm going to open that BAR placement can of=20
worms myself in a week or two because of resource placement changes I'm=20
preparing. And I already hit one such problem where a particular BAR=20
address results in probe failure I'll probably have to quirk around. And=20
I didn't even have to move things into another window to trigger that.)

I'm left to wonder how many of those are based on a IORESOURCE_PREFETCH=20
check, I strongly suspect none. Somehow I feel I'm the only one running=20
git grep and I fail to locate any examples of the problem you mention. No=
=20
offense meant, I just feel we're dicussion code that is hypothetical and=20
doesn't exist for real, and definitely not on large scale.

That being said, I don't have problem in accepting adding=20
IORESOURCE_PREFETCH to all PCIe resources was not a good idea so there's=20
no point in continuing discussion towards this direction.

Unfortunately, I've earlier discovered there's no "single place" unless=20
we add some gross res->flags fixup hack into PCI core. See e.g., the=20
commit bdb32359eab9 ("sparc/PCI: Correct 64-bit non-pref -> pref BAR=20
resources"), which we could hopefully revert after your change! So I'm=20
afraid if you go to the new flag approach, besides drivers/pci/ you'd have=
=20
to hunt down these from under arch/, and likely miss a few in the process.

Also, res->flags is currently full (for 32-bit) so you'd need to make the=
=20
field (and therefore struct resource) larger.

So I still suggest having a flags getter for this purpose would be better.
In the complete solution covering also resource fitting and assignment=20
algorithm, the main complication with that approach comes from the few=20
cases that don't have the struct pci_dev readily available. Some can=20
easily be handled by passing it as a param but there might be cases that=20
are given pci_bus as parameter that could be somewhat trickier if there is=
=20
no resource nor pci_dev (in case of a root bus), but I'm not immediately=20
sure if there are actually any cases for real that fall into the latter=20
category.
