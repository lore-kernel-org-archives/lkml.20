Well, not quite.

If this is suspend-to-RAM, all CPUs except for CPU0 are taken offline
during suspend and brought back online during resume.

So what happens is that cpufreq_suspend() runs first and calls
intel_pstate_suspend() for each CPU.  Without HWP, this just sets the
cpu->suspended flag.  In addition, in the passive mode,
cpufreq_suspend() stops the governor for all CPUs (which does nothing
for the performance governor).

When CPU offline takes place subsequently, intel_pstate_cpu_offline()
or intel_cpufreq_cpu_offline() is called for the CPU going offline.
The former clears the util update hook and invokes the latter.  The
latter sees the cpu->suspended flag set and bails out.

During resume, CPU online takes place first (except for CPU0) and
cpufreq_online() runs for each of the affected CPUs.  Each of the
involved policies is inactive at that time, so cpufreq_policy_online()
runs.  It invokes intel_pstate_cpu_online() which doesn't do anything
interesting without HWP, and then cpufreq_init_policy() is called and
it ends up calling cpufreq_set_policy().  That one calls either
intel_pstate_set_policy(), in the active mode, or the governor
->limits() callback that for the performance governor ends up calling
intel_cpufreq_target(), in the passive mode.

intel_pstate_set_policy() does the right thing and sets the P-state to
the max in the "performance" case, but intel_cpufreq_target() doesn't
update the PERF_CTL register if the new P-state value is equal to the
cached one.  That only happens for the performance governor though.

Subsequently, cpufreq_resume() runs.  It calls intel_pstate_resume()
for all CPUs (that doesn't do anything interesting without HWP) and
starts the governor for each of them in the passive mode, but that
does nothing for the performance governor.

This means a couple of things.

First of all, the fix is not needed in the active mode for CPUs other
than CPU0 because "online" takes care of them properly.  It may be
needed for CPU0 in that case because its PERF_CTL is never updated
throughout suspend-resume.  However, in the active mode, if the
performance governor is used, it is actually fine to access
pstate.current_pstate and call intel_pstate_set_pstate() without
synchronization because the update util hook is not set in that case.
If the powersave governor is used in the active mode, the update util
hook would need to be cleared at suspend time and restored at resume
time (modulo the possible offline and online in between).

Second, in the passive mode the fix is generally needed, but it is
safe to do in that case because the governor has been stopped during
suspend and will be re-started only after calling
intel_pstate_resume() (IOW, the needed synchronization is already
there).

Not entirely the case as you can see from the above.

 the problem.

Well, the question is whether or not it makes sense to restore a
pre-suspend value that's going to be overwritten immediately.  Maybe
not.

Since in the passive mode it is always safe to carry out that
restoration, it is kind of straightforward to do it always then.  In
the active mode though, it's probably better to just do it only in the
"performance" case and only on CPU0 (that doesn't undergo "offline"
and "online", but since it appears to work for you anyway, fixing the
passive mode may be sufficient for now.

I'll cut a patch for this unless someone beats me to it.

I'm not sure about this.  Maybe some other change related to "offline"
and "online" support.

Had the changelog been accurate, this would have been 28.

Passive or active mode?
