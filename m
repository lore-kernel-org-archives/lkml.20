Thanks for the review.

I don't think a fence in imsic_vsfile_local_read() helps here. The
problem is on the writer's side, and imsic_vsfile_local_read() runs on
a different hart.

The SETIPNUM write is done by whichever hart calls
kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_imsic_inject(), which can be any CPU (irqfd,
ioctl, ...). imsic_vsfile_local_read() runs on the old vsfile_cpu, via
the IPI from imsic_vsfile_read(). A fence only orders the accesses of
the hart that executes it, so a fence on the reading hart can't make
another hart's MMIO store land.

Without the fence, this can happen:

   hart A (inject)            hart B (update/release)    hart C (old 
vsfile_cpu)
   read_lock()
   writel(SETIPNUM)
     (store still in flight)
   read_unlock()
                              write_lock()
                              switch VS-file
                              write_unlock()
                              IPI ------------------->
                                                        fence  <-proposed
                                                        read+clear VSfile
                              free HGEI
   SETIPNUM lands: the interrupt
   is lost, or ends up in another
   vCPU's VS-file if the HGEI was
   already reused

Hart A's unlock can become visible before its SETIPNUM write has
reached the IMSIC, because read_unlock() doesn't order device output.
Nothing that hart B or hart C does afterwards can wait for that write.
Only hart A can hold back its unlock until the write is ordered, and
that is what the fence o,w after writel() does.

With the fence:

   hart A (inject)            hart B (update/release)    hart C (old 
vsfile_cpu)
   read_lock()
   writel(SETIPNUM)
   fence o,w
   read_unlock()
                              write_lock()
                              switch VS-file
                              write_unlock()
                              IPI ------------------->
                                                       read+clear VS-file
                              free HGEI

The SETIPNUM write is now ordered before the unlock, so it is also
ordered before everything hart B does after taking the lock, and,
through the IPI, before hart C reads the old VS-file. It can no longer
arrive after the read or after the HGEI is freed.

About the cost: this is the same fence that every writel() under a
spinlock already gets. On RISC-V, writel() only sets mmiowb pending and
spin_unlock() then issues "fence o,w". We need it explicitly here only
because vsfile_lock is an rwlock. It runs once per injected MSI, and
only when the vCPU has a VS-file.

The only way I see to keep it out of the inject path is for
update/release to IPI every CPU that might be injecting and run
"fence o,w" there before the old VS-file is read. That is much heavier
and moves the cost to vCPU migration, so I'd rather keep the fence in
inject. Let me know if you'd still prefer the other way.

One more thing, not directly connected to this patch: could you please
also take a look at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aia/issues/172?
The fence makes sure that the SETIPNUM write is ordered before hart C
reads the old VS-file, but hart C reads it through CSRs
(vsiselect/vsireg), not through memory. As far as I can tell, the spec
doesn't say whether a write that is already in global memory order is
guaranteed to be visible in eip at that point. If it isn't,
update/release will also need to drain the old VS-file before reading
it. Such a drain would build on this fence rather than replace it, since
it only works if the write is ordered before the unlock.
