Subject: [PATCH v10 1/8] HID: topping: transport for the M62's vendor controls

The Topping M62 is a USB audio interface whose analogue input gains,
output volumes and output source selectors are not described by the USB
Audio Class. They live behind a vendor protocol on a HID-class
interface, spoken by Topping's M Control Center, which has no Linux
build. What UAC does expose on the capture side is a digital trim after
the converter, which cannot buy signal-to-noise: raising it lifts the
converter's own floor with the signal. So on Linux the only gain worth
setting is unreachable, and a measurement application has to ask a
human to set it by hand on the front panel.

The protocol was read off the vendor application's traffic. Frames are
fifteen bytes:

	22 33 | 20 01 01 | TT | PP | s32 value BE | CRC16 BE | 66 77

with TT a target, PP a property of that target, and the checksum
CRC-16/MODBUS over bytes 2..10, most significant byte first. Reports
from the device are the same frame plus one pad byte. The vendor
application sends 00 00 in place of the checksum and the device accepts
it, so the device does not verify what it receives; this driver signs
its writes anyway and validates what it reads.

The card is silent until subscribed. One write of 0x11/0x24 starts the
notification stream, and it lapses unless repeated: the vendor
application sends it every two seconds and so does this driver. After
that the card reports what a hand does to its hardware -- jack states,
mutes, battery, and every turn of a front-panel knob.

The control pipe is not an option: GET_REPORT and SET_REPORT stall with
EPIPE for every report type, so the interrupt endpoints are the only
route. The report descriptor describes nothing worth having -- a
Generic Desktop application collection, eight usages stretched over
sixteen unnamed bytes in and out, no report ID -- so hid-generic makes
an input device with an ABS_MISC axis out of it and nothing else. Hence
the hid_have_special_driver entry, and HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW here with no
input device.

This driver is the transport and owns no controls. The controls belong
on the sound card that plays the audio, and they have to outlive this
driver's binding: a module reload that took them off the card would
renumber them, while a stored alsactl state and a sound server holding
the card both key on what was there. So they live in snd-usb-audio,
added in the following patch, and the two drivers meet through the
component framework with the audio side as the master. At bind this
driver fills in the struct topping_component it is handed -- the
header is new here, in the shape of struct drm_audio_component -- with
the one operation the controls need, sending a frame, and from then on
passes every valid frame the card reports to the audio side, which
decides what each one means. At unbind it tells the audio side first,
so that nothing is inside the operation when it goes. Without the audio
half this driver binds, subscribes and passes nothing on, which is
harmless.

Interface 3 is Application Specific / DFU and is never touched: a stray
write there can leave the card unusable. Only interface 4 grows a
component.

+ * returns sixteen zeroes.  The vendor application sends 00 00 in place
+ * of the checksum and the device accepts it, so the device evidently
+ * does not verify what it receives -- this driver signs its writes
+ * anyway, and validates what it reads.
+ *
+ * The device says nothing until it is subscribed: one write of
