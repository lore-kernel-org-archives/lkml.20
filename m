Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Retrieve files that were preserved from a tmpfs mount onto a tmpfs mount
chosen by userspace, instead of as memfds on the internal tmpfs mount.
Record which mount a file was on with a new SHMEM_LUO_FLAG_TMPFS flag in
struct shmem_luo_ser, based on the superblock of the file. shmem_luo
already accepts unlinked tmpfs files, such as files created with
O_TMPFILE, and a following commit also accepts linked ones.

The mount a tmpfs file was on doesn't exist in the new kernel, and
userspace may want to put the file elsewhere anyway. So add struct
liveupdate_shmem_retrieve_arg, which userspace passes as the retrieve
argument of LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_RETRIEVE_FD. It is modeled on open(): The
kernel creates a new file as if by openat(dirfd, ".", O_TMPFILE | flags,
mode), so the file gets the owner, permission checks and security labels
of any new file in that directory, and is charged to that mount. The
kernel then fills the file with the preserved contents, size, position
and seals before returning it, so nothing else can access the file
before it is complete. Userspace links the file at the path it wants
with linkat(), or passes O_EXCL to keep it unlinked. Neither the path
nor any other inode attribute of the file is part of the preserved
state, which keeps them out of the KHO ABI.

Pass the flags from userspace to file_open_root(), so that the VFS
checks them like for open(). file_open_root() silently ignores unknown
flags and mode bits, so reject those like openat2() does. Also reject
O_PATH, with which file_open_root() would ignore O_TMPFILE and open the
directory.

Keep the type of the file: memfds can only be retrieved as memfds, and
files on tmpfs mounts only onto tmpfs mounts, so that e.g. a file
can't be moved off the mount whose size limit and quotas it was subject
to. Passing the argument when retrieving a memfd, or not passing it when
retrieving a file from a tmpfs mount, fails with -EINVAL. Unlinked tmpfs
files were retrieved as memfds until now, but nothing relies on that, as
the LUO uAPI is not stable yet.

Like the other failures before the folios are restored, problems with
the argument and with creating the file can be retried.

+ * ``struct liveupdate_shmem_retrieve_arg`` to
+ * ``LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_RETRIEVE_FD``. The argument specifies a directory on the
+ * target mount, and the flags and mode of the new file. The kernel creates the
+ * file as if by ``openat(dirfd, ".", O_TMPFILE | flags, mode)``, so the file
+ * gets the same flags, owner, permission checks and security labels as any
+ * other new file in that directory. The kernel then fills the file with the
+ * preserved contents, size, position and seals before it returns the file, so
+ * nothing else can access the file before it is complete.
+ *
+ * Like any ``O_TMPFILE`` file, the new file is not linked into the filesystem.
+ * Userspace can link it at the path it wants with ``linkat()``, unless it asked
+ * for ``O_EXCL``. Like with ``open()``, the file must be opened for writing.
+ * LUO keeps the file open until the session is finished, so a retrieved binary
+ * can't be executed until then.
+ *
+ * The blocks of the file are charged to the target mount, so the size limit
+ * and quotas of the mount apply. If the file doesn't fit, the retrieve fails
+ * permanently, since the preserved contents have already been restored at that
+ * point. If the argument is invalid or the file can't be created, the retrieve
+ * fails before the preserved contents are restored, so it can be retried.
+ *
+ * memfds can only be retrieved as memfds, and files on tmpfs mounts can only be
+ * retrieved onto tmpfs mounts. Retrieving a memfd with the argument, or a tmpfs
+ * file without it, fails with ``-EINVAL``.
