I guess this has been written by an agent who like to talk? There is
really little point in explaining in multiple lines that
two-bits-per-bank is not compatible with one-bit-per-bank.

So I am not really happy with that. Given that we have existing
problems with the banks not all lining up (PortB and VCC-IO and
friends), just skipping the setup might be a pragmatic solution.
But then the kernel should engage the auto setting, as we generally
don't want to rely on firmware if we can help it.

So as I suggested before: please introduce a symbol like
BIAS_VOLTAGE_PIO_POW_AUTO or so, which also skips the explicit bank setup, like 
BIAS_VOLTAGE_NONE does, but then triggers setting all banks to auto, somewhere in the
generic pinctrl code. Just writing "01" to all banks should do it,
don't get hung up on banks that the manual doesn't describe: mostly
those bits either don't exist at all, or they belong to ports only
exposed on other packages. PortI looks like such a candidate, reading
the respective region tells me that there are 17 PortI pins implemented.
Same thing we saw on the A523/T527 and also on H616/H700.

As mentioned above: Yes, please do. And don't read too much into
silicon revisions or the manual not mentioning everything.

Cheers,
