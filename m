FYI. I checked vendor driver. Normally REG_ATIMWND sets 0xa or 0xc in AP mo=
de
for chips.

As you saw it is for TDLS channel switching (timeslot sharing), I
don't think it can work in AP mode...

I will ask USB experts internally to see if there is an interrupt
to notify driver about TBTT (or beacon early).=20

I think yes. The in AP mode, the value is 0xa or 0xc no matter which
HCI type is.

I will check internally to see if USB has an interrupt for TBTT.=20
