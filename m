I don't think the GICC is sufficient, you have to consider actual 
heterogeneous machines that have differing SPE implementations with the 
same PMSVer, which mean you have to keep the PPTT hetid check, and set 
the mask based on both it and the GSIV. Then, like DT create multiple 
platform devices. Which is true with the current patch as well, the 
hetid still needs to be there even if you have differing PPI's because 
it could have more than two differing implementations.
