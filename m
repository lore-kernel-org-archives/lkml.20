To be clear, I'm rejecting the original proposal because I think it's
internally inconsistent (if you follow the consequences of decisions
far enough).  I'm not necessarily opposed to something other than the
above, as long as the rules for when unknown tags must be invalidated
(and what that does to the version) are made very clear in the
structured tag spec.  e.g. see an alternative proposal below.

Correct.  Btw, I know I suggested "skippable tag" as a term, but given
how that gets kind of misleading in the case of writes, I'm coming to
prefer the orignal "structured tag" term.

Correct.

Yes.  This kind of happens naturally: since non-skippable tags are no
longer structured tags in current thinking, we won't be able to
complete scanning the tree to strip tags if we encounter any
non-skippable unknown tags.

Essentially the theory of the proposal above is to be maximally
conservative: any write (adding, removing, changing, in-place,
whatever) will invalidate all unknown tags and downgrade the version.


But, here's an alternative proposal for invalidation/version semantics
that I think is consistent, while being a bit closer to your original
proposal.

1. version and last_comp_version retain their meanings.  No new header
   version.
2. If version >=3D 18 the tree may include any structured tags, even if
   they weren't defined as of v18.
3. Some future version might _require_ certain structured tags to be
   present.  But a client must only rely on those tags if the version
   indicates it can.
     - e.g. suppose FDT_FOO tag is introduced in v20.  A client
       reading a v19 tree _might_ see some FDT_FOO tags (because of
       (2)), but cannot rely on them being present in all the places
       they should be.
4. Any write to a property (including in place) invalidates all
   unknown tags on that property (they must be stripped)
5. Any write to a property invalidates all unknown tags on that
   property's node
6. Adding or deleting a property on a node invalidates all unknown tags
   on the node
7. Adding or deleting a subnode invalidates all unknown tags on the
   node
8. Whenever a tag is invalidated and stripped, the overall version
   must be downgraded (to let clients know they can't count on tags
   being present)

Points (4)-(7) are all somewhat negotiable.  In particular, I'm not
sure how feasible (6) is to implement.

Note that because writes don't invalidate tags on ancestor nodes
beyond one level, this proposal doesn't permit tags to contain summary
information about an entire subtree that could be invalidated by
writes further down in that tree.
