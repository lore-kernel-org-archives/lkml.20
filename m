IIUC this patch basically adds a warning for ill-formed DTs but
doesn't otherwise change any behavior.  Obviously a developer could
fix the DT, but what would a user do in response to the warning?  

Is there something that doesn't work when this warning is emitted, and
fixing the DT would make it work?  If so, is there any hint that could
be included in the warning?  E.g., "DT device_type is missing; can't
support X"?

The commit log doesn't actually say directly what the patch does.  I
asked gemini to work on it, and it produced this, which is
straightforward but omits a lot of detail you might want:

  PCI: of: Verify "device_type" property for PCI device nodes

  According to the Open Firmware PCI Bus Supplement and Devicetree
  Specification, the `device_type` property is reserved strictly for
  PCI bridge nodes (with value "pci" or "pciex"). Non-bridge PCI
  endpoint nodes must not include a `device_type` property.

  Pre-defined Device Tree nodes representing PCI devices sometimes
  violate this requirement—such as endpoint nodes incorrectly
  specifying `device_type = "pci"`, or bridge nodes omitting
  `device_type` altogether.

  Introduce of_pci_verify_node() to sanity-check pre-defined Device
  Tree nodes assigned to PCI devices as they are registered in
  pci_bus_add_device():

    - Warn if a PCI bridge node lacks a "pci" or "pciex" `device_type`
      property.

    - Warn if a non-bridge PCI endpoint node contains a `device_type`
      property.

I'd like to get Rob's Reviewed-by since I'm not really a DT expert.
