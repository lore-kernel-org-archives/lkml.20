TBH,I omitted these bits for simplicity.
It's not just adding a TDX_CFG_F(XXX) for a feature, but also need to
add new X86_FEATURE_XXX definitions sometimes.
E.g. CPUID.7.0.ECX[0] (PREFETCHWT1), which is directly configurable and not
supported by KVM. It has no definition in <asm/cpufeatures.h>.

I am not sure that's worth it.

This is due to "generally speaking, KVM shouldn't allow features that KVM doesn't
support for non-TDX VMs".

I'm hoping Sean can weigh in on whether KVM should restrict TDX's CPU capabilities
in this way.

Oh, you just remind me that I should add comment for TDX_CFG_EXTRA_F() that
it must be used with a strong justification.
