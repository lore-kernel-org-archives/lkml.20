The M62's analogue input gains, output volumes and output source
selectors are reached over a vendor protocol on the card's HID
interface, which hid-topping, added in the previous patch, speaks.
This adds the controls themselves, on the sound card that plays the
audio, and the component master that joins them to that driver.

Nine controls: five input gains (IN 1, IN 2, AUX, BT, OTG IN), two
output volumes (HP, OTG OUT) and the two output source selectors. The
outputs come in pairs and the device announces only the second of
each, so both are written and the second is the one listened for. The
mixer matrix, the mutes, the loopback routing, the input power and the
EQ remain reachable only through the HID driver's hidraw node.

The controls live as long as the card. They are created at the first
bind of the HID driver and stay when it unbinds, unchanged and without
an event: a value written meanwhile is kept, and the next bind writes
back every value that is known. They are not even marked inactive,
because alsa-lib's simple mixer handles an INFO event by removing the
element and adding it again, and a sound server would see the same
churn as a removal. So reloading either driver changes nothing a
holder of the card can see -- the controls keep their numids, a stored
alsactl state keeps matching them, a mixer application keeps its
elements -- and no control is left showing a value the card does not
hold.

What the card does not report, this side decides. The card reports
what a hand does to its hardware: every turn of a front-panel knob,
and once subscribed the gains of the inputs whose jacks are present. A
source selector has no front-panel control and is never reported, and
an output volume is not reported until its knob turns. Topping were
asked for a command that reads the selection and declined to provide
one or to commit to adding one. A host that cannot read these values
has to set them, or it inherits whatever the last host left in a
battery-powered card, so the first bind writes them and from then on
the cache is the truth.

The values are the ones the rest of snd-usb-audio would choose rather
than the vendor's. For a volume whose GET_CUR fails, init_cur_mix_raw()
sets the minimum, and the level a user hears is left to userspace --
alsactl and the sound server, which run after the card appears. So the
analogue headphone stage starts at its quiet end; the digital stream
to a phone starts at unity, where it changes nothing; and each output
listens to the host's main stream, Playback 1/2, with the mixer out of
the path. After a resume the same values are written again from the
cache, in case the card came up on its own defaults while the host
slept.

The master's context is reached through devres on the audio control
interface rather than through drvdata, which on a usb_interface belongs
to snd-usb-audio itself; devres_find(), keyed on the release function,
gives it back inside the callbacks, which are handed nothing but a
struct device *. It hangs off the control interface rather than off the
USB device because component_match_add() allocates the match list with
devm: on the interface that is released at unbind, while on the
usb_device it would live until the device itself was released and a
rebind would stack a second list on top. The context itself is
reference-counted, held by the mixer until it disconnects and by each
control until the card frees it.

Neither component_compare_dev() nor component_compare_dev_name() fits:
the audio side has no pointer to the HID device, and the HID device's
name carries an instance counter that is not predictable. The match is
therefore one of descent -- the HID device sits two levels below the
USB device -- and which interface it is stays the HID driver's
business, since it registers a component for the vendor interface and
for no other. That keeps sound/usb free of HID symbols and of any
opinion about this card's interface numbering.

component_master_add_with_match() returns 0 with the aggregate merely
pending when the HID driver is absent, so the card comes up either way
and grows the vendor controls if and when the other half appears.
