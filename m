can: peak_usb: unregister the netdev before dev_free() on probe failure

This patch reorders the adap_dev_free error path in peak_usb_create_dev()
so that unregister_candev() runs before the adapter's dev_free() callback,
as peak_usb_disconnect() already does. The goal is to stop ndo_stop from
touching the shared interface object and the PCAN-USB FD command buffer
after dev_free() has released them when dev_set_bus(dev, 0) fails.

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue, but the comment above pcan_usb_pro_free() in
pcan_usb_pro.c still mentions only unplug:

/*
 * called when PCAN-USB Pro adapter is unplugged
 */
static void pcan_usb_pro_free(struct peak_usb_device *dev)

This probe failure path also reaches it, and it can kfree() the shared
pcan_usb_pro_interface here. The FD version, pcan_usb_fd_free(), already
says "called when the USB adapter is unplugged, or when probing a sibling
fails".

Could the Pro comment be updated to match?

> +	goto lbl_restore_intf_data;

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but on PCAN-USB FD and Pro the
first channel's dev_init() has already told the firmware that the driver
is loaded:

pcan_usb_fd_init()
	err = pcan_usb_fd_drv_loaded(dev, 1);

pcan_usb_pro_init()
	err = pcan_usb_pro_drv_loaded(dev, 1);

Only dev_exit() sends the matching drv_loaded(0) and turns the LEDs off.
This path, the lbl_unregister_candev path and peak_usb_disconnect() never
call dev_exit().

After a failed probe, does the adapter stay connected in the "host driver
loaded" state with no driver bound?

>  
>  lbl_unregister_candev:
>  	unregister_candev(netdev);

[Severity: High]
This handles the dev_set_bus() failure. Can the same close-after-free
still happen when dev_init() fails on the first PCAN-USB FD channel?

That failure still ends up here:

peak_usb_create_dev() {
    ...
	if (dev->adapter->dev_init) {
		err = dev->adapter->dev_init(dev);
		if (err)
			goto lbl_unregister_candev;
	}
    ...
}

On its error path, pcan_usb_fd_init() frees both shared objects and leaves
the pointers set:

pcan_usb_fd_init() {
    ...
		err = pcan_usb_fd_drv_loaded(dev, 1);
		if (err) {
			...
			goto err_out_2;
		}
    ...
err_out_2:
	kfree(pdev->cmd_buffer_addr);
err_out_1:
	kfree(pdev->usb_if);
err_out:
	return err;
}

The netdev is registered before dev_init() runs, and the device can stall
the pcan_usb_fd_drv_loaded() request until it times out. If the interface
is brought up during that window, pcan_usb_fd_start() increments
usb_if->dev_opened_count. After the free, unregister_candev() here then
runs:

unregister_candev()
  peak_usb_ndo_stop()
    peak_usb_unlink_all_urbs()
    pcan_usb_fd_stop()
      if (pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count == 1)
          pcan_usb_fd_set_options()  <- command built in freed cmd buffer
      pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count--;
    pcan_usb_fd_set_bus(dev, 0)      <- freed cmd buffer written again

pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd() checks PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED, but that bit is
still set for dev on this path, so the sends go ahead. The RX URBs
submitted by the open also keep decoding through the freed usb_if until
peak_usb_unlink_all_urbs() kills them.

The commit message describes this same scenario, and no later patch in
the series touches this path.

Would it be better to keep dev_init() from freeing state the netdev can
still reach? Another option is to register the netdev only after
dev_init() and dev_set_bus(dev, 0) succeed.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but register_candev() runs
before dev_init() and dev_set_bus(dev, 0). What stops an open from racing
with the half-initialized device? The only check in peak_usb_ndo_open() is:

	if (!test_bit(PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED, &dev->state))
		return -ENODEV;

That bit is already set before registration.

On PCAN-USB Pro, pcan_usb_pro_init() sets pdev->usb_if only at the very
end. Before that it sends two pcan_usb_pro_send_req() INFO requests and
calls pcan_usb_pro_drv_loaded(), and the device can stall each of them:

pcan_usb_pro_init() {
    ...
	pdev->usb_if = usb_if;
    ...
}

Suppose the bitrate is set and the interface brought up during that
window:

peak_usb_ndo_open()
  peak_usb_start()
    pcan_usb_pro_start()
      if (pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count == 0)  <- usb_if still NULL

Would this be a NULL pointer oops?

FD has the same problem with a shorter window. pcan_usb_fd_set_bittiming_slow(),
pcan_usb_fd_start() and pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd() dereference
pcan_usb_fd_cmd_buffer(dev) and pdev->usb_if before pcan_usb_fd_init()
assigns them.

[Severity: Medium]
This is also pre-existing and comes from the same register-before-init
ordering. Suppose the netdev is opened after dev_init() but before this
probe-time call in peak_usb_create_dev():

	/* set bus off */
	if (dev->adapter->dev_set_bus) {
		err = dev->adapter->dev_set_bus(dev, 0);

This puts the controller back in reset mode (PUCAN_CMD_RESET_MODE on FD,
SETBUSACT 0 on Pro). If the command succeeds, probe returns 0 and the
netdev stays up: can.state is CAN_STATE_ERROR_ACTIVE,
PCAN_USB_STATE_STARTED is set and the TX queue is running.

Does that leave an interface that neither sends nor receives until it is
taken down and brought up again?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but on PCAN-USB FD every channel shares one
command buffer, copied from channel 0 in pcan_usb_fd_init():

		pdev->cmd_buffer_addr = ppdev->cmd_buffer_addr;

While probe initializes channel N, it writes into that buffer without RTNL
or any other lock. The writes come from pcan_usb_fd_set_clock_domain() and
pcan_usb_fd_set_can_led(), and then from pcan_usb_fd_set_bus(dev, 0) in
peak_usb_create_dev().

Meanwhile, a sibling that is already registered can be opened, configured
or driven through ethtool under RTNL, and it writes the same buffer, for
example:

pcan_usb_fd_start()
  pcan_usb_fd_set_filter_std()

Can these commands interleave, so that the adapter receives a corrupted
command list?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch either. On PCAN-USB (pcan_usb.c),
the asynchronous restart doesn't seem to be drained before free_candev(),
either on this error path or in peak_usb_disconnect().

pcan_usb_restart_async() submits an unanchored URB with pdev as its
context:

	usb_fill_bulk_urb(urb, dev->udev,
			usb_sndbulkpipe(dev->udev, PCAN_USB_EP_CMDOUT),
			buf, PCAN_USB_CMD_LEN,
			pcan_usb_restart_pending, pdev);

	return usb_submit_urb(urb, GFP_ATOMIC);

The completion arms a timer without checking urb->status:

pcan_usb_restart_pending()
	mod_timer(&pdev->restart_timer,
			jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(PCAN_USB_STARTUP_TIMEOUT));

The timer callback then touches the device:

pcan_usb_restart()
  peak_usb_restart_complete(dev)
	dev->can.state = CAN_STATE_ERROR_ACTIVE;
	netif_wake_queue(dev->netdev);

Nothing in pcan_usb.c calls timer_delete() or timer_shutdown() on
restart_timer, and the adapter has no dev_stop or dev_free callback.
peak_usb_ndo_stop() only kills the RX and TX anchors, and close_candev()
only cancels the CAN core restart work.

Suppose a bus-off restart (restart-ms, or "ip link set canX type can
restart") is still in flight when the device is unplugged or probe fails.
Can the URB completion or the timer then run on the netdev private area
after free_candev() has freed it?
