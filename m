These don't have a switch because they're asserting we're already on a
specific tag type.  They should still do that with structured tags:
these functions should be checking that we're exactly on an
FDT_BEGIN_NODE or FDT_PROP, not on a skippable tag that sits before
one of those.

Or to put it another way, if we did have fdt_next_tag()
vs. fdt_next_tag_all() these functions should be using
fdt_next_tag_all().

>  - fdt_add_subnode_namelen()

The logic here is placing the subnode after the parent's properties,
by moving past any FDT_PROP or FDT_NOP tags.  With skippable tags we
do need to skip those too.  Which we can express instead as skipping
until we find either an FDT_BEGIN_NODE (indicating the first child) or
an FDT_END_NODE (indicating the end of a currently childless parent).
So, no need for a new switch here.

>  - fdt_finish()

No need for changes here either - this already skips everything that's
not FDT_PROP, so it will do the right think for skippable tags.

nextprop_() will need some rework, yes.

fdt_next_node() only barely: it already ignores FDT_PROP and FDT_NOP;
change that to 'default' and it will skip those and future structured
tags as well.

Rather, any tags unknown by the caller are assumed fatal.

"known tags" is meaningless here - what matters is whether the tags
are known by the *caller*, which we don't know.

Ah, yes, I think you're right.  Ok, that's not going to work.

It really can't, because it doesn't know what tags the caller is aware
of.  It can only make a distinction between "older tags than
<arbitrary cutoff>" and "newer tags than <arbitrary cutoff>".
