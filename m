Maybe I'm thinking about this backwards, but we're not talking about
"any" filesystem here. We're talking about the FUSE filesystem where
the definition of a handle _is_ inode+generation. All I'm proposing we
do is to expose that fact to the FUSE userspace daemon. That daemon
can then turn around and call open on another filesystem, or make a
network call to AWS or whatever. In my case I want to
open_by_handle_at on an underlying filesystem, but I can solve that by
storing a mapping from fuse_ino+fuse_generation_num to
underlying_fs_file_handle in my database.
