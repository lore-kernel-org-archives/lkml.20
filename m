What is missing from kmscon that the kernel currently supports?  Why not
just make it feature-equal there, and then make these additional changes
there as well?

As others have said, we don't want to add new features to the in-kernel
console mode due to all of the reasons the patch review has shown on
this series already (i.e. complex interactions that end up making the
system broken.)  This is best all done in userspace, where a bug there
will not cause these same problems, right?

But others use it, so we can't break that, and the fact that you ignored
those codepaths here makes me very worried.

This has nothing to do with KDE or Gnome, if you have issues with those
projects, please take it up with them and contribute to them to resolve
those issues.  I know they can always use the help.

And the rest of us feel the kernel console's code should be eliminated
entirely, when ever possible :)
