I know how PCI works, I used to be the PCI maintainer all those years
ago :)

Great, then just have that driver attach to the specific device you want
by having it contain the device ids for what it wants to control.  Or
have it say it wants to control all devices and be "last" on the list to
bind.

I don't understand what you are trying to say here, sorry.  Yes I know
how PCI config space works, again, I was the maintainer and still have
access to the PCI sig through various means.

Great, then have the admin never allow the in-kernel driver to be on the
system, or be loaded (modprobe has deny lists) and all is fine.

what are you defining as a "session" here?

And as said before, that's a horrid hack and one that is breaking things
today in all sorts of ways, which is why the taint was added.

If you wish to override the kernel, then great, a taint flag is added
and all is fine.  All this means is that now developers know what you
did and can decide to ignore your bug report or not.  No functionality
changed at all.

No functionality changed, just an informational flag is now in the
system when this happens.  The systems still obviously work just fine,
otherwise all testing so far of linux-next would have caught this,
right?

Why are you worried about a taint flag?  So many servers run with taint
flags enabled due to out-of-tree or questionable licenses with no
problems, what's one more informational bit here?
