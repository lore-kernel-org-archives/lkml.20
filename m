Ah, yes that's true :) Although there's no need for us to do an
invalidate on the unmap path...

I have to admit I'm coming from experience on CPUs - there speculation
means a CPU can load a cache line at basically any point. So the
argument that a line cannot be in a cache almost never holds. GPUs (at
least Mali GPUs) haven't quite got to the stage of CPUs.
