A couple of caveats to this:

Only the most basic set-up parts need to go into MFD (shared resource
allocation, core device initialisation: clocks, resets, regulators,
IRQs, etc.  Anything that does a 'thing' needs to reside in the
applicable sub-system that supports the 'thing'.

Device need to straddle at least 2 additional subsystems to qualify as
an MFD which undoubtibly would be HID and then something else: gpio,
regulator, uart, iio, clk, what have you.

I have no idea what that means, but we can discuss it.  Maybe this lives
in some form of platform data?  I'd be able to advise better when I know
what it is.
