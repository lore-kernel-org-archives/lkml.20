There is a related set of mail threads, that however are not the trigger
for Greg's effort.=20

Initially I suggested to protect the pwm-tegra driver from attaching
to unexpected devices via a check in .probe():

   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pwm/ed943d9be3b785514e0f65a5b8c13a78aba7a0=
90.1789741839.git.u.kleine-koenig@baylibre.com/

Thierry suggested a dedicated flag in struct device_driver instead
allowing to opt out of the driver_override mechanism:

   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pwm/20260922-driver-override-opt-out-v1-0-=
58c35ded3b83@nvidia.com/

I think Greg was motivated by syzcaller triggering various exceptions
using driver_override.

So my opinion on the right way forward is:

 - Given that there are only very few drivers that are supposed to be
   used for a driver override, there should be an opt-in (instead of the
   opt-out that Thierry suggested).

 - The changes from this thread (i.e. make usage of bind/unbind result
   in a taint) should be dropped. I wrote earlier that I'm ok with a
   taint for a usage of driver_override, but with the previous item
   implemented, I don't think that is necessary.

Uwe
