OK, good.
I'll start carrying a similar quirk like you proposed below on
"NVIDIA", "T41     ", affected_revision, ACPI_SIG_DSDT,
in the next version.

Ah right :/
Yeah that's really unfortunate then...

Yes that's a good question.
I think we should just not support partial clear then.

Reading the spec and given that these are supposed to be short-term
excursions I wouldn't think that keeping the register as read-only makes
much sense, therefore just support full clear and document the race window.
I think dropping the stale read still makes sense, even if it widens the
window, it'll be there anyway.

But I'm happy for Rafael and you to chime in, too! 
Do you have any userspace actually caring about Performance Limited?
What would be the most sane behaviour?
and thanks for testing!
