Thanks Sean, Pratyush. @loganodell has recently sent the RFC[1] on
backward compatibility for liveupdate. This discussion is important
so I propose to move the backward compatibility discussion on [1].

For guest_memfd preservation, I will sent v5 soon with the following
changes:
1. Suggestions from across the patches
2. tentative Plan for future Guest_memfd preservation
3. tentative Plan for VM preservation.
4. Backward compatibility built on top of RFC [1]

What do you think?
