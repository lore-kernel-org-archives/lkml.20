One detail on the wrap check: alpha_perf_event_update() also advances
prev_count on an ordinary read. Should we cover the case where a read
has already accounted for a real wrap before its PMI is delivered?

On prefetches, the EV67 HRM, section 2.6 (p. 2-23), says loads to
R31/F31 may generate exceptions that PALcode must dismiss. So seeing
no Linux fault wouldn't by itself tell us the access hit in the DTB.

I also checked the saved ES40 recordings: 344 of 266425 samples had
both PM_KILLED_BM and TRP set, and 53 of those also had MIS set.
That confirms the Python decoder needs the killed check on EV67 too.

Thanks,
Magnus
