That was the argument behind exposing all channels in early drivers like
the max1363.  In general it seems to be more convenient to limit
to what makes sense, but it isn't an ABI requirement so if you prefer
it like this fair enough.

There are sensors with that sort of level of precision, I'm just not
convinced they are ever going to get there for capacitance sensors.

The burden ends up on whether userspace code runs into any problems
with high numbers of digits. I don't mind them being long if not.

Tends to end up cleaner and not really be that hard to do in a register
based driver.  I don't mind that much though if you prefer to not do
so.
