Thanks for looking into this.  That looks like an acceptable danger of
breakage to me.

Thanks!  I do wonder if we're doing this if we should update __eq_ and
__hash__ methods to take into account the property name.

Thanks.  And, yes, it's probably best to wait until I've reviewed the
rest of the series.  Which might take a while, sorry.
