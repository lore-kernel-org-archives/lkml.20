Hi all,

This patch series adds support for ROG Ally handhelds in the HID driver for ASUS devices.

The changes include reinitialization of the device after exiting a sleep state,
gamepad configuration, vibration strength configuration, joysticks and triggers
range configuration, anti-deadzone configuration, response curve support,
force feedback support, gamepad mode support, turbo buttons support,
and button remapping support.

This driver is based on the original Luke's work, which was a great starting point
and I have reworked it to be upstreamable, while keeping the original functionality
intact and extending hid-asus to avoid regressions in functionality such as the
backlight control.

The ally support has been a surprisingly long task, spanning multiple years and
being used in Steam OS and well as other distributions for quite a while,
and I am happy to finally be submitting it.

At this time LEDs are not part of the patch series as I have work in progress to
unify LEDs handling across all ASUS devices, and I will submit that in a separate
patch series when the userspace interface will be ready to express capabilities
of these devices, but that will take some more time.

This driver is the culmination of a lot of work, from many different people,
and I want to thank Luke for his original work, as well as the many people that have
helped me test and provide feedback on the driver: Khamunetri, Jonathan, Derek,
Matthew and others that have helped during these years.

Best regards,
Denis Benato

With v7 the series is rebased on top of the asus tree: the first patch of v6
has been applied upstream as 8099f9da59f1 ("HID: asus: do not send keyboard
init reports to touchpads"), so this series is now 12 patches.

The probe paths of the ally interfaces now reserve the interface role while
their initialization is running, the configuration attributes work from the
moment their files exist and a failed initialization rolls the configuration
back instead of leaving the created sysfs groups behind. The response curve
is no longer configured entry by entry: a single attribute per joystick now
takes the whole curve in one validated write, and a companion index file
documents what each value is.

With v5 I returned to the original manual management of memory and sysfs groups
as going devm did not play well with the general "plugin" architecture of the
ally portion of the driver and has caused more bugs than it solved: sashiko-bot
will have to come to terms with hand-managed memory this time.

      interface removal by holding intf_mutex in the callers

    - Restore the recorded gamepad mode after an MCU reset
  - HID: asus: add support for turbo buttons
    - Fix UAF allocating the turbo button entries with kcalloc
    - Restore the cached turbo parameters after an MCU reset
  - HID: asus: add support for btn remapping
    - Keep the button mappings outside of the controller lifetime, so
      that the recorded configuration survives a re-probe
    - Re-apply the recorded mappings after an MCU reset
    - Fetch the configuration through ally_get_config()

- v6
  - HID: asus: add support for ROG Ally handhelds
    - Add a maximum size check in ally_alloc_cmd()
    - Drop the dead x_hdev snapshot taken in hid_asus_ally_raw_event()
    - Drop the unused hdev parameter of handle_ctrl_alt_del()
    - Drop the unused hdev/report parameters of ally_x_raw_event()
    - Turn the "// F20;" comment into a proper "/* F20 */"
  - HID: asus: add gamepad configuration
    - Publish the configuration (ally->config under ally_data_lock)
      before the sysfs groups are created and withdraw it on the error
      path: attributes could become visible while ally_get_config()
      still returned NULL and the restore path silently did nothing

      restore path exactly like the apply path does
    - Drop the unused struct device * parameter of the four
      response-curve helpers
  - HID: asus: add support to force feedback
    - Drop the unused pointers from ally_x_send_ff_report() and ally_x_send_ff_off()
  - HID: asus: add support for gamepad mode
    - Apply the mode exactly once from hid_asus_ally_init()
  - HID: asus: add support for turbo buttons
    - Remove the calibration groups created before a sysfs failure
  - HID: asus: add support for btn remapping
    - Do not gate remapping by turbo
    - Reject NULL remap/macro pointers in ally_set_button_mapping()
    - Carry the ally pointer in struct button_remap_attr
    - Fix the "hypen" comment typo

- v7
  - The "HID: asus: do not send keyboard init reports to touchpads" patch
    is not part of this series anymore: it has been applied upstream as
    8099f9da59f1 and the series is rebased on top of it
  - HID: asus: add support for ROG Ally handhelds
    - Reserve the probed interface role for the whole duration of its
      sleeping initialization: a concurrent probe of the same role could
      pass the singleton checks before the first one published its pointer
  - HID: asus: add gamepad configuration
    - Publish drvdata->rog_ally before the configuration attributes are
      created: the callbacks fetched it before asus_probe() published it
      and returned -ENODEV in the meantime
    - Roll the configuration back with ally_config_remove() when
      hid_asus_ally_init() fails, instead of leaking the created sysfs
      groups and the button entries
  - HID: asus: add support for response curve
    - Replace response_curve_pct_1..4, response_curve_move_1..4 and the
      apply attributes with one response_curve attribute per joystick that
      takes the whole curve in a single validated all-or-nothing write:
      staged partial edits reaching the MCU on resume cannot happen anymore
    - Add a read-only response_curve_index attribute documenting the
      meaning of each value
    - Restore both curves unconditionally on init/resume: only validated
      curves are recorded now
  - HID: asus: add support for btn remapping
    - Drop the stale cfg->turbo_support gate in ally_config_create():
      remapping attributes are created for every device with button
      directories, not only turbo-capable ones
