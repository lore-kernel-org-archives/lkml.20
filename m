Why?  The whole point is atomicity, and without O_EXCL there is no
atomicity.
I guess it doesn't hurt to not require O_EXCL, but it is just another
combination to test...

No reason why not.  It is mapped to  -ENOENT

			if (unlikely(d_is_negative(dentry)))
				error =3D -ENOENT;

I'm in favour of ->atomic_open() calling finish_no_open() is all
no-error cases where it didn't do something about opening the file.
But I don't object to an explicit -ENOENT return.

Odds a good that there wasn' a specific reason why leaving the dentry
negative was chosen.  I think the better question is "do you have a
problem with this patch" where the patch does a lookup.

Putting a WARN_ON(d_really_is_negative()) somewhere in vfs_mkdir would be
easy enough. I cannot imagine it really being a burden for any fs.  If
that does happen were can solve the problem then.  Being prepared of all
possible eventuality is a no-win proposition.  I've tried - I gave up.

->atomic_open was created specifically for NFSv4 which has a combined
lookup/create/open request.  You can do everything with a combination of
->lookup and (exclusive) ->create (providing create returns a
non-negative dentry) and ->truncate and open.  Using ->atomic_open means
fewer round-trips to the server so less latency.

NFS doesn't have a concept of "open" for directories.  CIFS probably
does.  FUSE probably doesn't but could possibly add one.
But directories are not opened nearly as often as files, so combining
things isn't so important.  And O_TRUNC is not meaningful for
directories so that is one fewer thing that could be combined.
