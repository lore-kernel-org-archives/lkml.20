IMO I would rather have something that's incredibly strict and simple, 
or nothing at all. Having to work around edge cases and report near 
misses doesn't sound great.

But we can have a schema for json files that are checked into 
tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/ regardless of who reads them. The schema can 
say that "Counter" is valid as long as we agree that it's ok for that 
field to exist, even if jevents.py doesn't read it.

Then it's as simple as:

   from jsonschema import validate
   for path in Path(pmu-data).rglob("*.json"):
     validate(json.loads(path.read_text()), schema)

Where 'schema' is something like:

   schema = {
     "type": "array",
     "items": {
         "type": "object",
         "required": ["EventCode", "EventName", "BriefDescription"],
     ...
