Sure, will try to reduce this noise in kvmarm.

Well, IIUC it's kind of the default behavior, right?
Direct - DBM means HW can promote that page RO->RW, with HAFDBS=on
S2PIE  - All pages can be promoted RO->RW, as long as HAFDBS=on

I think the approach you suggest makes sense, and it makes it simpler to 
deal with permission indirection in the future. In order to do like that, 
while keeping a single encoding for direct permission, I suggest we have:

-	KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_W			= BIT(2),
+	KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_DIRTY			= BIT(2),
...
+	KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_DBM			= BIT(6),
...

+#define KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_W	(KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_DBM | 
+				 KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_DIRTY)

(Rationale is: it's writable if it's either dirty, or can be made dirty by 
hardware on a write)

And then replacing by PROT_DIRTY the uses of PROT_W which were only 
tracking the fact it's dirty. I tracked just a couple of those.

When detecting the PROT_* based in PTE encoding, we track PROT_DIRTY, and 
PROT_DBM individually. The same can be done in nested, as we can just 
ignore the PROT_DBM for shadow pagetables, given we want, IIUC, to fault 
and update the original pagetables.

That would avoid switching between encodings while toggling HACDBS, and 
while making use of the DBM without directly associating it with the write 
permission.

What do you think?

Makes sense to me now.

Sorry I took long to reply your message, I was reading the docs for S2PIE 
and thinking on a solution that would make sense for it in the future as 
well.

I hope it's enough, but if it's not, let me know of any suggestions or 
requisites.

Thanks!
