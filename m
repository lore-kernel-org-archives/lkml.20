Is PLL a part of the the same domain or a different domain?

I think that the conclusion was that the consumers should care about the
full set of supplies they need, which includes all transient and leaf
supplies.

You have described several cases, where PLLs stand out, while the rest
of the clocks are typically more or less in line. Would it make sense
instead to solve the same issue in a slightly different way:

clock-controller@abcdef {
    compatible = "qcom,sm8888-clockcc";
    // required to access registers of the controller
    power-domains = <&rpmhpd RPMHPD_MMCCX>;
    required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_svs>;

    pll0 {
        power-domains = <&rpmhpd RPMHPD_MMMX>;
        operating-points = <&trivian_opp_table>;

        trivian_opp_table: opp-table {
	    compatible = "operating-points-v2";

	    opp-100000 {
	        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <100000>;
		required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_super_low_svs>;
	    };

	    opp-500000 {
	        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <500000>;
		required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_turbo>;
	    };
        };
    };

    pll1 {
        /* same PLL type, same table */
        power-domains = <&rpmhpd RPMHPD_MMMX>;
        operating-points = <&trivian_opp_table>;
    };

    pll2 {
        power-domains = <&rpmhpd RPMHPD_MMMX>;
        operating-points = <&completian_opp_table>;

	/* other PLL type */
        completian_opp_table: opp-table {
	    compatible = "operating-points-v2";

	    opp-123456 {
	        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <123456>;
		required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_super_low_svs>;
	    };

	    opp-333333 {
	        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <333333>;
		required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_nominal>;
	    };

	    opp-888888 {
	        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <888888>;
		required-opps = <&rpmhpd_opp_lower_turbo>;
	    };
        };
    };
};

The clock controller driver would then create a per-PLL device, bind it
with the OPP table, etc. The consumers would still vote on the resources
necessary to run the leaf clock, while the clock controller would care
about the PLLs.

You can guess, I don't like the idea of having voting tables in the
clock driver...

If the clocks are independent, it's a different question. I don't think
we have a way to describe that we need OPP table a for clock CLK_A and
table b for CLK_B.

If we need to scale several clocks in a lock, the problem is manageable.
We need 2x entries (at least for the typical cases), because we need to
have one entry for each MMCX level and for each MX level.

Yes... See the proposal above.

One needs to consult it anyway, more or less.

RCG doesn't (typically) care about MX. It is not split between multiple
domains, is it?

This can quickly become a lock dependency (and lockdep) hell. Consider
two consumers setting the same clock concurrently (heh, nice design, I
know). For each of the consumers we must make sure that there is no
AB-BA voting update, which means that the whole sequence of
pre-set-rate vote, clk_set_rate() and post-set-rate vote should happen
under a single lock. However under the lock we vote for genpds, which
might trigger other transitions or, in the worst case, wake up the
domain.

I think this depends on the RPMh translating votes or not. Is it really
fine to run MMCX at turbo if CX is at low_svs?
