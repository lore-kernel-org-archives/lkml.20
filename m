Not quite. Let me elaborate my use case.

For live update we need to preserve HWPT (iommu domain) so the devices
can continue to do DMA during live update. Domains are preserved by
preserving page tables and relevant data structures using KHO.

To make sure that the devices can only DMA to preserved memory, the user
preserves the memfds (into KHO) that are mapped in the preserved hwpts.
During iommufd preservation we need to check that the memory backing the
iommu mappings is preserved. We do this by checking if the mapped memfd
is preserved, but if the memfd had a hole punched into it before its
preservation then the punched pages will not be preserved. For this we
need to do a complete page table walk and test each page separately.

A punch hole seal, before the memfd preservation, allows iommufd to
optimize the validation path and avoid doing full page walks.

The HWPTs are not preserved into memfd; the memfds are mapped into HWPT
and we need to make sure that the mapped memfd has not mutated and the
pages mapped from it are preserved. Also it is ok if the user writes to
the file or mmaps it.

For live update either approach works. If pinned pages cannot be punched
or truncated, iommufd can rely on that directly and the seal is not
needed. I went with an opt-in seal only to avoid changing existing
behaviour. If folks are fine with blocking punch hole and truncate on
pinned pages, I can send patches for that instead.
