Makes sense to me.

My humble eyes were unable to easily understand the change.  Is the change
effectively same to below, and if so, would this be easier to read?

Someone might hate the second 'ret' assignment.  But I was unable to make it
look cleaner without introducing a >80 column line.  The file already has
multiple >80 column lines and I don't really mind having a new long line,
though.


Thanks,
