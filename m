If this is a platform device, the PM domain detach will power it off,
which I forgot about, so the driver only needs to prepare the device
for that.  If there is no PM domain, the driver runtime suspend
callback function can be used for the power off in principle.

So I think that the original code flow here is fine with the caveat
that if a PM domain is there, the driver may not actually need to
carry out the power off by itself.

That shouldn't be necessary as per the above.

So this effectively assumes no PM domain because platform_probe()
calls dev_pm_domain_attach() with PD_FLAG_ATTACH_POWER_ON set.

No, it's fine with me except that there is a difference between the
"PM domain present" and "no PM domain" cases and at least some drivers
may need to take it into account.
