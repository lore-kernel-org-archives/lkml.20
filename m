Does the APM say this? My version doesn't (Revision 4.09, March 2026):

	15.33.1 VMSAVE and VMLOAD Virtualization

	This feature allows the VMSAVE and VMLOAD instructions to
	execute in guest mode without causing a #VMEXIT. The VMCB
	address in RAX is treated as a guest physical address and is
	translated to a host physical address. Any page fault in
	attempting that translation will result in a normal #VMEXIT with
	a nested page fault exit code. If the translation is successful,
	the register state transfer to or from the VMCB will then be
	performed.

	Support for virtualized VMSAVE and VMLOAD is indicated by CPUID
	Fn8000_000A_EDX[15]=1.  When this feature is available, it must
	be explicitly enabled by setting bit 1 of VMCB offset 0B8h to 1.
	This enable bit is only recognized when the hypervisor is in 64
	bit mode, nested paging is enabled and Secure Encrypted
	Virtualization is disabled, otherwise attempted execution of a
	VMLOAD or VMSAVE in the guest will result in a #VMEXIT with a
	VMSAVE/VMLOAD exit code.

In fact, this is opposite to the conclusion I reached in 55780d8a1dcc9
("KVM: SVM: Stop toggling virtual VMSAVE/VMLOAD on intercept recalc"),
and I like to think that I tested on HW back then (tho I honestly don't
remember).

Actually, looking at nested_vmsave_vmload_test.c, I make sure that the
intercepts are honored (in L1) *even* if VLS is enabled. I also *think*
that in that test, KVM will end up setting both the intercepts and VLS:
1. nested_vmcb_needs_vls_intercept() will return false because the guest
   supports VLS, has NPT, and enables VLS.
2. KVM still copies the intercepts from vmcb12 anyway, including VMSAVE
   and VMLOAD, see nested_vmcb02_recalc_intercepts(). KVM (correctly)
   doesn't clear VMSAVE/VMLOAD intercepts if VLS is enabled by L1 (but
   it does the opposite).

So this test case passing should be confirming my allegation that
intercepts take precedence over VLS.

I think the test also goes on to clear VLS and test the behavior with it
cleared, which should be further evidence that KVM leaving the bit set
is harmless, because KVM will intercept VMSAVE/VMLOAD if L1 clears VLS,
even tho it will leave VLS set in vmcb12.

All that being said, I am not opposed to doing this in terms of hygiene.

Also not opposed to this.

Yeah this seems like a pre-existing issue. I suppose we can move
svm_update_lbrv() outside of nested_vmcb02_prepare_control():

1. In enter_svm_guest_mode(), call it after
nested_vmcb02_prepare_save().
2. In svm_set_nested_state(), call it after
nested_vmcb02_prepare_control(), as svm_copy_vmrun_state() should have
already updated the LBR and dbgctl regs.
