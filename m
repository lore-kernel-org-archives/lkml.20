Thank you for sharing these.  Especially the second requirement is very
interesting to me.

As you may already know, DAMON can provide not only the observability but also
such tiering like operation.  SK hynix and Micron are developing their tiering
solution using DAMON.  I also developed [1] TPP-based solution.  I'm wondering
if they considered directly using tiering solution instead of doing observation
and operation separately.

Thank you very much for sharing these details.  I now get much clearer picture.

I think the DAMON setup may have rooms to improve.  When someone asks me
recommeded setup for access pattern observability, I recommend to use intervals
auto-tuning and read idle time percentiles, similar to DAMON_STAT.  If you
haven't tried that, I'd recommend to try it.  I presented [2] this basic idea
at Lst year LPC refereed track.  Hopefully that could give you more ideas.  If
you tried it and found some problems, and that resulted you in this setup,
knowing the detailed context would be helpful for me.

I'm still in a very early stage of perf event based monitoring prototyping.
Hence I have no expertise to find a real concern at the moment.  I was just
thinking it _might_.

Sounds good, looking forward to the progress.

No worry.  Nothing needs to be rushed.

Indeed we might hijacking Ravi's thread and adding unexpected mails to
recipients' inbox.  Please feel free to drop recipients or start a new thread,
whatever you prefer.

Yes, this is very helpful.  I have raised followup questions above, though ;)
No pressure.  I understand not every detail can always be revealed, and
sometimes it takes time.  Please answer only if you want, and when you get the
chance.
