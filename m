Hi,

This series is moving way too fast with new versions. Please slow down.

We're not aiming to who manages to produce highest version counter for a 
series. ;-)

You're making non-trivial changes so please do expect human review to 
take time. Cranking new versions almost back to back (or even every other 
day) will just fill up inboxes.
