Thanks for updating!

BTW, to make it easier for review, can you split the patches in
several parts? For example, start from a minimum basic functionality
(just internal stackmap, seq_read, and reset), use it from tracing,
add stat interface, binary interface, and documents, tools, selftests.
This makes the series in at least 7 patches, but nicer to focus on
one thing for each patch.

The patch description is a key area to focus on; if the explanation
proceeds by saying "add Foo, then add Bar, and so on," those changes
should likely be split into multiple patches.

Thanks,
