bind/unbind and driver_override are two very different operations. The
first is something that should generally work and I consider it a safe
operation. The practical use includes reloading drivers that hang and
also switching operational devices on a devboard that cannot be used at
the same time due to pinctrl conflicts or different clk needs.

driver_override is a foot gun that allows to bind unsuspecting drivers
on foreign devices and thus make e.g. of_device_get_match_data() return
NULL for a driver that assumes that cannot happen because all
of_device_id entries have a non-NULL .driver_data yielding null pointer
exceptions.

See also the feedback you got on
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260914-bind_taint-v4-0-eadf8a090903@linuxfoun=
dation.org/
where (apart from me) Danilo Krummrich argued that unbind/bind should be
considered safe compared to driver_override and also our conversation in
#kernelnewbies where Richard Weinberger concurred to that.

Having said that I think there is only a handful of drivers that are
actually supposed to work when used in a driver override (vfio stuff,
spidev and i2c-dev come to mind), so I'd prefer that drivers opt-in
instead of opt-out. Otherwise we yet another flag that drivers should
set in general but don't because driver authors are not aware[1]. The
few drivers that rely on driver overriding should be identified quickly,
and if we miss one that doesn't result in a way to make the kernel oops.

Also note that setting .suppress_bind_attrs on a driver doesn't prevent
driver_overriding. After you point a device to a different driver you
might not make it bind via sysfs immediately, but that might happen at a
later point. (I'm not sure, but maybe it's enough to plug in a USB
thumbdrive?)

Best regards
Uwe
