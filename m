I indeed believe that no-one ever tried to implement this (but I did
not check).

>> openSUSE still drags the Takashi's downstream patch with a DMI check. It would be nice to sort this out upstream and drop that private one ;).

Ack, that would be great also to fix the issue on other distros.

Note my suggested approach of using an acpi_is_hid_device() check
in the elan touchpad driver does carry a risk of causing regressions.

But I think it is worth a try, maybe combined with limiting
it to a HID of "ELAN0000" or first try without and on
regressions on devices with another HID add that ?

And if this approach fails (causes regressions) then we should
upstream Takashi's downstream patch with a DMI check.

Regards,

Hans
