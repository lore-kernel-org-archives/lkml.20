I looked into this, and it becomes fairly complicated. We can move all
vdev/TDI-related code to arm-smmu-realm-v3.c, but that would result in:

1. Adding more CCA-specific code to the SMMU driver.
2. arm-cca-host continuing to own the TSM link setup (IDE).
3. Adding callbacks from the device communication helpers back into
   arm-cca-host, since device communication still goes through DOE.
4. Moving the device communication helpers to firmware/arm-rmm and adding
   something like:

static const struct arm_rmm_pdev_comm_ops cca_dev_comm_ops = {
	.send = cca_dev_comm_send,
	.get_cache = cca_dev_comm_get_cache,
	.refresh_stream_keys = cca_dev_comm_refresh_stream_keys,
};

The locking also becomes more complex. Unlocking a vdev can trigger a
stream key refresh, which is owned by arm-cca-host. Currently, the locking
is simpler, using pci_tsm_rwsem and pci_tsm_pf0::lock. With the SMMU driver
owning the vdev/TDI, we would have:

- pci_tsm_rwsem protecting the lifetime and registration state of
  pdev->tsm.
- pci_tsm::tdi_lock protecting the function's pci_tdi pointer.
- pci_tsm_pf0::lock protecting DSM-wide connect and disconnect operations,
  including probing and removing functions managed by that DSM.
- The lock associated with arm_rmm_pdev_comm protecting the shared PDEV
  communication buffers and cache state used for ARM RMM communication.

I have a working prototype, but it requires quite a bit of cleanup and
rebasing before it can be posted as a clean patch series. Let me know if
you still want to proceed with this approach.

In summary, this requires three subsystems (arm-smmu-realm-v3,
arm-cca-host, and firmware/arm_rmm) to interact closely, with clearly
defined locking rules. Previously, all of this was contained within
arm-cca-host.
