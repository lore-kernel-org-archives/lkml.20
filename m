I was thinking something like this
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/thomash/xe-vibe/-/commit/0ab1cefa5c1439701e2=
a09d2de2d03722b63b509

Although I have a couple of review comments on the infrastructure, and
it doesn't include re-negotiation at map-time.

I'm not 100% clear as to whether Christian meant the mapping-type would
be re-negotiated if an agreed mapping type failed, or whether we would
just allow a transparent fallback to system memory dma-buffers?
Christian?

In any case, IMHO the infrastructure must allow for an importer to
rather fail a mapping if the original attach-agreed mapping type was
severed at mapping time, and then you'd get the same behaviour as you
are sketching now? Or you could chose to take an unlikely slowpath to
perform whatever's necessary to accomodate the new mapping type, even
if that includes having to re-fault already ODP-faulted memory. Pinning
would also be an option, I figure.

Thanks,
Thomas
