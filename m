I'll update the commit message to clarify that other block ciphers are
dropped as well.

I'll change it to EOPNOTSUPP.

Almost every kernel has CRYPTO and CRYPTO_SKCIPHER2 enabled anyway, and
CRYPTO_SKCIPHER2 also enables ECB support.  So the change isn't actually
as drastic as the bot implies, but I'd be glad to give BPF_CRYPTO a
prompt if the BPF folks are okay with that.

Yes, lskcipher should be deleted in a follow-up series.

I'll change it to use a local variable.

I'll update the comment.
