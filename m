Looking at this again we could :

a. If the user triggers a graceful kexec reboot, i.e, without forced,
    we should be able to deactivate the RMM. Since all processes are
    killed, Realm VMs must be off and all granules reclaimed.
    When we get to dynamic GPT/Tracking, we should additionally
    reclaim them back.
b. For forced reboot kexec, I don't think there is a safe way.

We have two options here :

1. Disable kexec reboot (allowing kexec kdump) when the RMM is active
    at kexec_load. I prefer this for now, and we could goto 2 eventually.

2. Back out from machine_kexec() if the RMM was still active.
    This allows (a) above.

Yep, we could do this, and I have added the following hunk :
