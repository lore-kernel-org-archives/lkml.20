Yeah there are still effort trying to push memsw into V2 upstreamly,
I even got a suggestion to hold a topic on that last year at LSFMM
but didn't find enough time :P

Hmmm... I mean there are tons and tons of projects trying to get
rid of the overhead of virtualization, if you are referring to
virtialization as a broad topic..

With careful design we can miminize the overhead for sure, and
that's exactly why we need to do the design carefully :D

That sounds interesting, but I think this is already a mini
version of swap tiering :D

And not sure if the implementation will looks odd, e.g. like if you
adjust that midway, you get different slot of different compression
rates.?

Right, thanks for the info, I don't have any transparent compression
hardware so not aware of how that part works, the software based
one is being very commonly used though.

That data is very helpful info! But it could be very hardware dependent,
especially with certain mitigations and hardwares, the faulting
process may slowdown by a lot. This is the right picture for most
cases, and for another example on one of our certain instance of VM, I
observed this (high pressure, batch fault):

                    component                      탎/page
page fault handling (directly calibrated)          ~1.92
swap machinery (slot, swap cache, rmap, zram, etc) ~1.04
lzo decompression                                  ~0.32

Kind of crazy that decompression only take a very minor part
of it.  While storage based SWAP goes through SPDK so it changes
dramatically according to the host, setup or spec.

BTW CRAM looks really nice from the data of yours :) !

Right, monitoring is less effective from somehting that is directly
in the kernel.

Hmm, but the historical defination is the logical entry, no?

Hmm, I mean in general swap are page fault (swap entry) based, that makes
them similiar and that's the common point?

Making ZRAM have a lower priority could make sense... Well I haven't
actually see it being used that way, but first there are users of
multiple ZRAMs indeed, and e.g. if you put offline batch tasks on the
same machine with high priority tasks, and the offline batch task only
want to finish their work, however slow is fine, and the user want to
have lower impact on CPU usage from them, with a limited storage space.
Well I have to say this looks odd and just a theory, but we have see
too many bizzard usage of the Linux kernel, there are even people
using deprecated GPU's VRAM as SWAP for CPU's RAM, and hey they
still make sense, you can easily found popular community projects
based on that.
