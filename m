So PortB has no supply of its own, instead it's always supplied by
VCC-IO. That was even more common on older SoCs, with also PortH and
PortF being supplied by that. Which somewhat means that this is broken
there as well?

What do you mean with "the board's SEL value"? That's not the SoC reset
value, is it? So who programs that value, and why?

... naturally, because nothing in mainline sets VCC-IO, which is beyond
the SoC's GPIO bank offset.

So this means you hacked the register in the vendor kernel, for the
sake of an experiment? And I guess this just means that the vendor
kernel uses UHS, and uses register 0x70 to switch PortF to 1.8V? So you
need either auto or 1.8V for it to work, the same problem we hit with
PortC on the A523.

So can you say whether you observed a real problem with either the
current (broken) code, or with one the fixes? I am still confused about
your reports, whether they are just experiments, and comparing to the
BSP, or looking at the manual, or whether there is an actually observed
problem.

Thanks for the confirmation, and just curious where this revB
restriction came from, originally?

Well, this is getting really messy, isn't it? I never understood why
the IP even allows manual programming if there is an automatic setting.
Did you find any recommendation? IIRC manuals for other SoCs did
recommend one or the other method. If AUTO works, and is used by the
BSP, then we can just use that, but in a much simpler way: either use 
BIAS_VOLTAGE_NONE, or create a new AUTO name (better), and then skip
the whole action in sunxi_pinctrl_set_io_bias_cfg(). Instead just once
program the GPIO_POW_MOD_SEL to "all auto", once at init time.
Curious what others think about this.

Cheers,
Andre
