Hi all,

[TLDR Summary]
 [V11 highlights]
 - V11 adds an RFC patch with an initial set KSelfTest for the purpose of
   ABI compliance verification
 - V11 adds ABI support for alternative/additional 0-sized query also for:
   SCMI_TLM_GET_INTRVS / SCMI_TLM_SINGLE_READ / SCMI_TLM_BULK_READ
 - V11 carries on addressing more reviewers reports and particularly
   reviews at large some basic TDE/lines locking

 [V12 TODO]
  - Address the remaining outstanding Sashiko/reviewers issues
  - [ABI]: more DOCS and examples
  - [KSFT]: add more testcases
  - [STLM]: general cleanup

The upcoming SCMI v4.0 specification [0] introduces a new SCMI protocol
dedicated to System Telemetry.

In a nutshell, the SCMI Telemetry protocol allows an agent to discover at
runtime the set of Telemetry Data Events (DEs) available on a specific
platform and provides the means to configure the set of DEs that a user is
interested into, while reading them back using the collection method that
is deeemed more suitable for the usecase at hand. (...amongst the various
possible collection methods allowed by SCMI specification)

Without delving into the gory details of the whole SCMI Telemetry protocol
let's just say that the SCMI platform/server firmware advertises a number
of Telemetry Data Events, each one identified by a 32bit unique ID, and an
SCMI agent/client, like Linux, can discover them and read back at will the
associated data value in a number of ways.

Data collection is mainly intended to happen on demand via shared memory
areas exposed by the platform firmware, discovered dynamically via SCMI
Telemetry and accessed by Linux on-demand, but some DE can also be reported
via SCMI Notifications asynchronous messages or via direct dedicated
FastChannels (another kind of SCMI memory based access): all of this
underlying mechanism is anyway hidden to the user since it is mediated by
the kernel driver which will return the proper data value when queried.

Anyway, the set of well-known architected DE IDs defined by the spec is
limited to a dozen IDs, which means that the vast majority of DE IDs are
customizable per-platform: as a consequence, though, the same ID, say
'0x1234', could represent completely different things on different systems.

Precise definitions and semantic of such custom Data Event IDs are out of
the scope of the SCMI Telemetry specification and of this implementation:
they are supposed to be provided using some kind of JSON-like description
file that will have to be consumed by a userspace tool which would be
finally in charge of making sense of the set of available DEs.

IOW, in turn, this means that even though the DEs enumerated via SCMI come
with some sort of topological and qualitative description provided by the
protocol (like unit of measurements, name, topology info etc), kernel-wise
we CANNOT be completely sure of "what is what" without being fed-back some
sort of information about the DEs by the afore mentioned userspace tool.

For these reasons, currently this series does NOT attempt to register any
of these DEs with any of the usual in-kernel subsystems (like HWMON, IIO,
PERF etc), simply because we cannot be sure which DE is suitable, or even
desirable, for a given subsystem. This also means there are NO in-kernel
users of these Telemetry data events as of now.

So, while we do not exclude, for the future, to feed/register some of the
discovered DEs to/with some of the above mentioned Kernel subsystems, as
of now we have ONLY modeled a custom userspace API to make SCMI Telemetry
available to userspace tools.

With V5 we adopted a pure chardev/IOCTL ABI approach, refining the IOCTL
based interface already present with the previous FS-based ABI.

INTERFACES

For each discovered SCMI Instance a character device named tlm_<N> is
created under /dev/scmi/ subtree.

The IOCTL interface described at 'include/uapi/linux/scmi.h' is made
available to enumerate and configure Telemetry resources: Telemetry data
can be collected using a few different IOCTls, depending on the required
granularity.

Alternatively it is possible to obtain a list of the file descriptors
referencing directly the underlying SCMI Telemetry SHMTI memory areas and
implement in user space an SCMI Telemetry parser accessing directly the
SHMTI, while staying in compliance with the SCMI TDCF format.

NOTE THAT from v3 onwards the firmware interface level NOW supports ONLY
the latest SCMI v4.0 specification [0].

Based on V7.3-rc1, tested on an emulated setup.

This series is available also at [1].

If you still reading...any feedback welcome :P

Thanks,
Cristian
