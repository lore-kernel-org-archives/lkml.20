Hello Marc, Vincent and Oliver,

I need help (or training) to figure out how to deal with these AI bots:

- How many of them are there before the changes are accepted? It seems that=
 even if a patch has passed the Sashiko filter, we should still expect feed=
back from other bots...

- The fact that there are multiple levels of bots isn=E2=80=99t a problem i=
n itself, and is understandable. That feedback arrives on v1 even though v2=
 has already been analysed is also something I=E2=80=99m just learning: so =
when can we consider it safe to push a new version without fear of receivin=
g comments on the previous one?

- And finally, providing more explicit comments on our changes is also a go=
od thing. But when those comments themselves become a source of problems an=
d rejections=E2=80=94due to an overly nitpicky interpretation by a bot=E2=
=80=94it becomes far too time-consuming:

> The "entire message buffer is discarded" wording also reads as if
> this
> patch adds that behaviour. The goto fail path in
> pcan_usb_fd_decode_buf()
> is unchanged. Records decoded before the bad one have already been
> passed
> up via netif_rx(), and only the bad record and the ones after it are
> dropped.

Best regards,
