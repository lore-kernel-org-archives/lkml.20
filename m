Good question, I did think about this (rationale below) though ended up 
trying to keep this function simpler/easier to reason about.  I can have 
another look.

< long info, as AlexM and I were talking about this offline >

The position of your comment sounds like the device registration was 
part of the concern, but can you clarify please?  I think it's more that
..._fault() now takes dmabuf->resv plus vdev->dmabuf_lock (on top of the 
pre-existing vdev->memory_lock) rather than the device registration. 
The device registration refcount should be cheap (like, not block or 
contend beyond the atomic op), and wasn't the bit I worry about.  :)

The overhead is the single thread "this function does more stuff", plus 
the scenario of threads both concurrently faulting.

What's the baseline/fast path?  With an internal/VFIO mmap DMABUF we'd 
at least need vdev->dmabuf_lock for its status, then the existing 
memory_lock for existing reasons.  But once you have memory_lock then 
(aside from the access cost of the atomic op) the new dmabuf_lock will 
be cheap/uncontended in the absence of a blitz of concurrent exports. 
(Export vs fault is a new performance dependency.)

[ Aside: when adding vdev->dmabuf_lock it occured that we could revisit 
the tests in vfio_pci_vmf_insert_pfn() that require memory_lock, and 
remove that lock from the fault path:  e.g. if we know a DMABUF isn't 
revoked then that implies vdev->bars_revoked = false, and that should 
already be in sync with pm_runtime_engaged, __vfio_pci_memory_enabled() 
...  I haven't traced this all through. ]

The one I worry about more is dmabuf->resv; if there are importers and 
fencing then this'll now hold up behind them.  (But this is only for 
explicit DMABUFs, and feels like the price you pay with P2P.  This won't 
happen for internal/VFIO mmap DMABUFs.)

My gut concern is mostly the straight-line cost of Taking More Locks, 
rather than that they will be hugely more contended in the threaded case 
(where threads will already interfere via memory_lock, and taking 
dmabuf_lock under that is Unlikely to also contend).  Well, and
dmabuf->resv.

But I don't have measurements of this; more complex will obviously cost 
more, though we don't yet know whether it's prohibitive or noise.

I'd rather not split this function before it's a problem, so to speak, 
as it'll be slightly more complicated.  What I'd do:  introduce a flag 
to vfio_pci_dma_buf to indicate "was internal/external export" then use 
this to do extra synchronisation, or avoid it for a VFIO mmap VMA. 
(priv->file != NULL is more or less that, but might be cleaner with a flag.)

Hmm.  I'll hack up a test to try to measure the relative overhead of 
VMA faults before/after (modulo access to meaningful HW).

> Hopefully we can get those selftests included to avoid regressions.

We'll post more tests separately (there're some extra requirements, e.g. 
"real devices"/device access to work through).  The existing tests go 
some way regarding avoiding existing VFIO fd mmap() regressions.  The 
liability of not bringing the DMABUF-mmap tests into this series is just 
on that feature, at least.

If anyone has tested this series (whether to see existing VFIO works, or 
to try the new DMABUF-mmap/revoke) that would be great to know.  AlexM 
and I have some ideas for further testing internally too.

I'm glad, I feel it's in a good state now.

100% agree needs more eyes.  FWIW Kevin and Praan reviewed ~all of v5, 
though I dropped their R-Bs because all of the patches have in some way 
changed.  (Though most of the changes are very small, am a stickler for 
process.)  Please, if they or others have time for another pass... <:-)


Many thanks,


Matt
