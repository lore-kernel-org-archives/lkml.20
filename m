Agreed, this might give the wrong impression, depending on the
assumptions the reader makes about autosuspend delay. (I think I had a
particular problem scenario in mind, but didn't translate that properly
here.)

Right, that seems wrong, and indeed that's not what this patch does.

(Not sure I'm parsing this sentence quite right, but...)

The point is that last_busy should propagate (rather than, say, the
expiration time). So each device still gets its own-delay-based
autosuspend timer expiration. That may mean the parent waits longer than
the child, but it may not, if the child's delay was longer than the
parent's.

If I'm understanding what you're saying correctly: maybe it would be an
improvement here to say:

  If that parent configured an autosuspend delay longer than its child's
  and didn't otherwise maintain its last_busy timestamp, it may now be
  immediately eligible to suspend.

I think that would more accurately describe the target problem, even if
it doesn't cover all cases (such as when the parent delay is shorter).

Do you have concrete use cases in mind, or do you bring this up simply
because of my note?

For one, I feel like for devices with power.use_autosuspend==true, it's
reasonable to expect drivers to use the appropriate helpers to update
last_busy at the appropriate times, and so any "corner cases" are from
misuse.

But if you mean non-use_autosuspend devices: I suppose it'd be possible
but I haven't reasoned through the implementation very far yet. It
almost seems like we'd need to plumb pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() into
*all* the put() helpers, including the non-autosuspend ones
(pm_runtime_put(), pm_runtime_put_sync()). I'm not quite sure if that's
desirable. But I could try to look a bit more, if you think there are
important use cases that would need this.
