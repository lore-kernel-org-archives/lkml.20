Yes, I aware of that — "having one might not lead to the issue".

I posted some a few months ago, when I pointed out to that noise in the commit
messages, it was like a pushback, but since that I have convinced several
developers to follow, so it might be worth to try again (but it should not be
insisting, just a recommendation). Also note, that even in the cited piece
there is no clear point where to put that Cc tag. It's only required for
stable backporting process to be in the commit message, otherwise that tag
may well be located after the '---' line which still makes it a (email)
tag, but visible in the commit message.

Have you checked in dynamics? (Note, most of those Cc comes from Andrew
Morton's scripts and TIP tree.)

I used this:

$ git log --no-merges --grep '^Cc:' --pretty="%(trailers:key=Cc)" v<$A>..v<$B> | grep -v '^$' | grep -v 'stable@vger.kernel.org' | grep -v stable.*@kernel.org | wc -l

where <$A> and <$B> give a range.

v6.19..v7.0: 11525
v7.0..v7.1: 11594
v7.1..v7.2: 10946
v7.2..v7.3-rc7: 8696

You see, it works!

As I explained above it doesn't really conflict, it rather old established
process when people want to have that Cc be recorded, now we have
lore.kernel.org for that and I successfully convinced several people to follow.
