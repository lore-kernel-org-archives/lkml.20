Hi Alireza, and thanks for the feedback! I'll see what can be done
about dso__load in v2.

I don't disagree. Fwiw, a C++ memory allocation failure inside my
company's code base is a runtime abort. In perf, many code paths
return -ENOMEM or NULL. I wanted to see how far we could get with a
"shrunk" set of data inside perf as even if we fix memory allocation
around symbols, other code paths can still fail.

I'm still not massively sold on having explicit bounds. It reminds me
of old and often seemingly arbitrary numbers like the number of rows
or columns in a spreadsheet. That said, perf has a similar problem
with exhausting file descriptors. As long as the default is
"unlimited," I'm okay with some attempts to limit size, but we should
implement obvious garbage collection as I hope this series introduces.

That's surprising as no behavioral change was intended. That then
leads to the question of which symbol is right and whether a latent
bug is being fixed or a new one introduced. Oh what fun :-)

So most of my experience with excessive memory usage has come from
perf top, which seems to leak memory and consume all your RAM before
long. That is expected since no DSO is currently unloaded. I'm hoping
the shrinking process can be generic.

Definitely. I was more focused on the reference counting aspect.
Things like the policy around shrinking can be amended as needed, I
just wanted to establish a policy so the patches made sense. I think
lazier loading, shrinking, .. all make sense for things to be faster
and use less RAM.

No, I'll fix this mistake.
