Hi Jonathan,

thanks for your time...I sincerely hope you're travelling abroad on some
remote timezone given the time these reviews came in :D

Usually I try to implement the complete set of features of a new protocol
but indeed this new Telemetry thing is huge by itself so it became quickly
overwhelming to review...imagine to code and test it.

Based on our real world initial customer of this I can certainly drop a
few features that are not supported anyway by the real FW and move it to
a later patchset, stuff like groups, notifications and single sample
reads, but all of the rest is hardly removable while keeping the system
functional and usable.

Not sure what you mean by drop timestamps, definitelly cannot drop
boot-on (it is how systems are configured indeed) neither debugfs used
for bring-up and FW debug.

I am not sure how many lines I can shed with the above features drops but
I'll give it a go anyway at slimming down the series after I have gone
through this round of Sashiko pains.

From the testing/functional/performance standpoints the series has
definitely improved especially, but still some road to go.

Thanks,
Cristian
