Fair, CTLV is the bigger part (with the generator and generated files
too), and it is meant to be general, with attestation as its first user.
It is closer to netlink than to an RPC system though: no objects,
proxies or daemon, just a device fd, one ioctl, and messages the kernel
checks against the family's schema before the driver sees them.
Ment to be easy to use and error prone as much as possible.

RFCv2 will be smaller too: it will leave out the events and the
MR journal as well.

Agreed, RFCv2's CTLV doc and cover letter will open with that.

There are no versions, on purpose. The ioctl struct carries its size
and grows only at its end. A family grows by new ops and
new optional fields: an old program skips what a newer kernel
adds to a reply, a newer program marks what an older kernel may skip in
a request, and op-schema-get tells it which fields the kernel acts on.
Anything incompatible is a new op. Each family also has a checked-in
ABI snapshot, so a uAPI change is a visible change of that file, and
the checker refuses removing anything, narrowing a bound or making a
field required.

For a trivial interaction there is ctlvctl, which needs no generated
code, only the family's YAML for the names; the cover letter has a few.
In RFCv2, reading an MR will be:

  ctlvctl query /dev/attestation/attestation0 mr-read id=1

with CTLV_SPEC_DIR pointing at Documentation/ctlv/specs.

Agreed, that design is unfortunate. I was attached to the netlink and
netlink yaml too much. But RFCv2 will have the YAML in the layout
Jason suggested on 11/20. Groups and sets will be gone: a spec will
have records and ops, each op the tree of its request and reply, and
the comment above an item will be its doc, in the uapi header and the
rendered docs too:

  # One MR's values, and the MR generation they belong to.
  mr-read:
    type: query
    fd-access: read
    optional: true
    suggested-reply-length: 4K
    request:
      id: uint(..u32-max)
      device-generation?: record
      options?: extension mr-options
    reply:
      device-generation: record
      mr-generation: record
      mr-values: record

The generator will also print each op as a call, and RFCv2's cover
letter will list them so:

  mr-read(id, device-generation?, options?: mr-options) ->
      { device-generation, mr-generation, mr-values[23]: mr-value }

Right, intention is to change it in RFCv2.

Yeah, confusing a bit, agreed. Will change to "records" in RFCv2.

In RFCv2 the stub will go, and the YAML will name the extension point
directly: "info: extension device-info".

Right, will check those.

Correct. The MR values are the hardware's, so they already hold what
firmware extended; what is missing is the kernel's record of it, and
RFCv2 will leave the journal out. An import will belong to the series
that brings the journal back, as an op or a provider callback, and
adding either is compatible.

Yes. Each MR says whether it may be extended, and the core refuses
mr-extend on one that may not, so a provider can keep the DRTM PCRs out
of userspace's reach.

Nothing here makes DRTM extend later. What has to be measured before
the subsystem is up, at module_initcall(), can be measured as it is
today, and how early a TPM provider takes over is for the TPM series.
For DRTM's own measurements the subsystem buys little. What it gives is
the rest: userspace would read the PCRs, get a quote and fetch the logs
the same way on a TPM as on TDX, and later, kernel users such as IMA
would extend through one API whatever the root of trust. And no, I see
no reason for all implementations to extend at the same point.

No. In RFCv2, evidence objects will carry logs in their own formats:
TDX will return the CCEL as an event-log object, the bytes as firmware
wrote them, and a DRTM log would be one in its TCG format, read with
the tools that already parse it.
