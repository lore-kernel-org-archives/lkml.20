thanks, I think i had a fixup for one of those in my local v2. I'll 
check and send it as a separate patch if it was important.

Yeah, that was my plan: First agree on something that can be accepted 
into the kernel and then work on the rest of the boot chain. The current 
code in m1n1 that sets up bare bones EFI tables is just a hack to proof 
this all actually works.
