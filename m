Hi Anup,

Thanks for the explanation and for suggesting the per-vCPU sanitization
mask. Building on your proposal, I would like to suggest two changes:

1. Separate the invalidation strategy for vCPU migration and a mask hit.

    Keep HFENCE.GVMA for vCPU migration, identified by
    last_exit_cpu != vcpu->cpu, when hardware VMIDs are available. Use
    HFENCE.VVMA when the current host CPU is marked in tlb_sanitize_mask.
    A mask hit caused by another vCPU of the same VM running on this CPU
    requires VS-stage sanitization; it does not by itself require G-stage
    invalidation.

    For example, if vCPU0 and vCPU1 both last ran on CPU0, switching from
    vCPU1 back to vCPU0 only needs the mask-triggered VVMA. This avoids
    requesting G-stage invalidation when the shared G-stage mappings have
    not changed. If both migration and a mask hit occur, both fences run.

2. Move mask updates to kvm_arch_vcpu_put().

    Mark the outgoing host CPU in the masks of the other vCPUs of the
    same VM when a vCPU is put. This also covers a switch between vCPUs
    on one host CPU without either vCPU migrating. Marking only when
    migration is detected in kvm_riscv_local_tlb_sanitize() would miss
    that case.

    The marking now happens on the outgoing CPU before another vCPU can
    enter guest mode there. The migration-time marking and kicks are
    therefore removed. The trade-off is an O(nr_vcpus) walk on each
    qualifying put().

    How about the following change ?
