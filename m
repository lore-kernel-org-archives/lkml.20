I agree that duty resolution matters. I think the remaining question is
which configurations we should expose to the waveform API, rather than
whether bypass itself is PWM.

Restricting bypass alone would not give the higher-resolution
alternative. With the 24 MHz and 100 MHz parents and an unconstrained
pair, a single 24 MHz cycle still reports a 42 ns period and wins over
40 ns. For example, a 42 ns period / 31 ns high-time request currently
becomes 42/21 ns; without bypass candidates it becomes 42/0 ns, not
40/30 ns.

The same tradeoff occurs entirely in cycle mode: at 84 ns, two 24 MHz
ticks provide three duty levels, while eight 100 MHz ticks provide nine
levels at 80 ns.

So achieving the resolution preference would also require restricting
ordinary cycle-mode candidates or changing the period-first selection
policy.
