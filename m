Agree, I will submit a new patch to fix this behaviour and account for mTHP.

Lian, thanks a lot for the review and pointing this issue.>>

The idea of this patch was to introduce auto tuning. I think I submitted thebenchmark results when I sent the DAMOS_COLLAPSE feature.

Anyway, it shouldn't take long for me to get more data. I think it may be useful
for people to know the actual results in real application.

SJ, what's the best place to publish all those data? I believe you have more
experience sharing this data and which platform is the most useful one.>>
