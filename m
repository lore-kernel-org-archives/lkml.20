Hi,

Reporting a stale-cached-vmcs02 bug: a few vmcs02 fields that are written only on
the dirty_vmcs12 rare path are *decided* by state that can change without setting
dirty_vmcs12, so they survive stale across nested entries. This is the Intel twin
of the nSVM stale Virtual-VMLOAD/VMSAVE bit you recently took as a real bug. The
one that matters is an L2->L1 TLB isolation break via a stale VPID; there is also
a host-side KASLR disclosure on PEBS hosts (details below). Not host
memory-safety, and not reachable on the kvmCTF config (I checked; see the end).

Root cause
----------
CPU_BASED_VM_EXEC_CONTROL is a SHADOW_FIELD_RW (vmcs_shadow_fields.h:49). An L1
VMWRITE of it does not exit under hardware VMCS shadowing, and handle_vmwrite()
does not set dirty_vmcs12 for shadowed fields (nested.c:5874 only for
non-shadowed). copy_shadow_to_vmcs12() then syncs it silently at VMRESUME.

prepare_vmcs02_early_rare() (nested.c:2411) and prepare_vmcs02_rare()
(nested.c:2630) run only when dirty_vmcs12 is set. Two of their writes are gated
on nested_cpu_has2(), i.e. on the *primary* ACTIVATE_SECONDARY bit:

  - VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR_ID  = vpid02 vs vpid01		(nested.c:2431/2433)
  - XSS_EXIT_BITMAP       written only if XSAVES set	(nested.c:2691)

Everything else is re-derived from the live vmcs12 on every entry: vmcs02's
secondary controls in prepare_vmcs02_early(), and every TLB-flush target
(vmx_get_current_vpid(), nested_vmx_transition_tlb_flush(), handle_invvpid). So
after an ACTIVATE_SECONDARY toggle done with a shadowed VMWRITE and no other
non-shadowed VMWRITE before VMRESUME, hardware runs L2 on the VPID/XSS-bitmap
chosen for the *old* activate state while the rest of KVM follows the new one.

Manifestation 1 (VPID): L2->L1 TLB isolation break
--------------------------------------------------
ACTIVATE 0->1 (VPID turned on): vmcs02 keeps vpid01, but handle_invvpid() and the
KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST emulation target vpid02, so L1's INVVPID for L2 never
reaches the entries L2 actually holds. L2 keeps a stale translation after L1
remapped the page. The 1->0 direction is the mirror (a missed architectural entry
flush). On 6.1.74 the 0->1 / missed-INVVPID case is the live one.

Dynamic, host 7.1.2, pinned (a pCPU migration does a global flush). L2 maps GVA
0x80_0000_0000 -> page X, reads it; L1 flips ACTIVATE 0->1 by a shadowed VMWRITE,
remaps the PTE to Y, issues single-context INVVPID for vpid12=1, VMRESUMEs; L2
reads again:

  U1 (control, VPID on from launch) INVVPID rflags=0x2, read#3 = Y (fresh)   as architected
  U2 (ACTIVATE 0->1 by shadow VMWRITE) INVVPID rflags=0x2, read#3 = X        DEVIATION: translation survived L1's INVVPID
  U3 (U2 + one non-shadow VMWRITE) read#3 = Y                                 as architected

5/5 rounds, host dmesg clean. U2's INVVPID VMsucceeds (rflags 0x2) yet the stale
translation is still observable.

Manifestation 2 (XSS): ACTIVATE 0->1 with XSAVES set leaves vmcs02 with the old
(often empty) XSS_EXIT_BITMAP, so L2's XSAVES/XRSTORS of components L1 asked to
intercept (e.g. CET_S, loading L1-owned IA32_PL0..2_SSP) run without the exit.
Observable only where the guest can set IA32_XSS bits (a CET CPU). Measured on
7.1.2.

Member 3 (MSR auto-load/store counts): host-side effect
-------------------------------------------------------
prepare_vmcs02_rare() is also the only entry-side writer of the vmcs02
VM_{EXIT,ENTRY}_MSR_*_COUNT fields (nested.c:2740-2746). The exit side resyncs
vmcs01 unconditionally ("The tracking is per-vCPU, not per-VMCS", nested.c:5172-5176),
but the entry side does not. add_atomic_switch_msr()/clear_atomic_switch_msr()
write the count only into the current VMCS and only on a membership change, so if
the perf MSR list changes while vmcs01 is current (L1 running) and the next
VMRESUME does not dirty vmcs12, vmcs02's counts are stale.

On pebs_ept CPUs (Ice Lake server and later) with guest PEBS, a stale-smaller
count leaves the guest IA32_DS_AREA unloaded on the stale entry, so while L2's
PEBS counter runs the hardware keeps the *host's* IA32_DS_AREA (a page in the
per-CPU randomized cpu_entry_area). The PEBS assist treats that host linear
address as an L2 linear address; the walk goes through L2 paging and EPT, so no
host memory is read or written, but it marks L2's own paging structures, which
discloses the host cpu_entry_area base to the nested guest. Confirmed on Sapphire
Rapids (Xeon Gold 6430): the decoded address matched the host rdmsr 0x600 exactly,
dmesg clean, no KASAN report. This is a host KASLR disclosure to a nested guest,
not host memory-safety.

Fixes / precedent / suggested direction
---------------------------------------
Fixes: 25a2e4fe8ef7 ("KVM: nVMX: initialize more non-shadowed fields in
prepare_vmcs02_full"), which moved the nested_cpu_has*-gated VPID/XSS writes and
the MSR counts into the dirty-gated path. Its own changelog states the rule it
left incomplete ("we copy them always ... because the corresponding execution
control might be one of the shadowed fields"). 2abb25273c82 ("KVM: nVMX: Force
MSR bitmap refresh if runtime eVMCS controls are modified") is the same
"derived state not refreshed when a shadowed control changes" class, treated as a
real bug.

I would suggest either treating a change of the effective ACTIVATE_SECONDARY bit
as dirtying on both entry paths (VMLAUNCH and RSM), recorded where the rare paths
run, or the point fixes: decide VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR_ID per entry in
prepare_vmcs02_early(), write XSS_EXIT_BITMAP unconditionally under
cpu_has_vmx_xsaves(), and move the three MSR-count writes into prepare_vmcs02()
to mirror the exit side; plus extending the vmcs_shadow_fields.h rule to "a
shadowed field must not gate anything in the rare paths". I am happy to send and
test a patch.

kvmCTF / scope note: on the Cascade Lake-Server kvmCTF config this is
guest-contained. Manifestation 1 is L2<->L1 only (attacker and victim are both the
guest), 2 needs guest XSAVES (xsaves=off there), and member 3 needs guest PEBS
(pdcm=off there, and Cascade Lake keeps the perf generic MSR list empty anyway).
I verified the EPT/MMU context and every host-physical vmcs02 field are re-derived
every entry, so no stale-pointer-to-host-memory path exists; a 200k-round
multi-vCPU KASAN churn of the nested-EPT lifecycle under the toggle stayed clean.
So this is an upstream correctness / isolation report, not a kvmCTF submission.

Reproducers (standalone probes with small L1/L2 blobs) for all three members are
available; happy to share or adapt them to a selftest.

Thanks,
Amirmohammad
