<Alt>-<Fn>, for a start.  Also the facility to enter an arbitrary Unicode
code point by holding down <AltGr> and typing the hex code on the numeric
keypad.  There are probably other things, too.

I suspect the politics involved would be more difficult than here, and
I'm not good at politics.  kmscon is controlled by Redhat, and they have
a reputation for dismissing third party suggestions and patches rather
than integrating them.

But it's not just a matter of adding features.  The kernel console is an
elegant system.  You just have to add entries in /etc/inittab, select a
keyboard, select a font (all mostly done at system installation) and
that's it.  kmscon is anything but elegant.  It has something like 75
command line options, and a configuration file is virtually mandatory.

kmscon has no documentation for its keyboard system, nothing to compare
with Andries Brouwer's keymaps man page.  It uses xkb.  I remember
searching for xkb doc around 10 years ago and found nothing systematic.
Just a very helpful tutorial, which enabled me to  make my changes.

I don't think it's got doc for its various font systems either.  It might
well be that you need to use a GUI to make font changes.  That is not a
Good Thing.

From the user's point of view, a bug in either will render his computer
unusable.

Have you considered that the code in kmscon might not be any better than
that in the kernel's console?  I've no evidence either way.

Hey, give me a chance!  One thing at a time.  I didn't ignore that code,
I noted (in two Kconfig's) that it would also need attention, and I
blocked it out safely when CONFIG_FB_GLYPH_21BIT was set.

It may well be (I'm not sure) that these facilities for the blind are an
integral part of the kernel's console.  That would be a good reason not
to remove it from the kernel.

My point is that the kernel's console is rock solid and dependable.
Things like kmscon are subject to the vagaries of fashion.

The rest of you don't appear to be console users.  It's easy to advocate
for removal when you don't use it yourself.
