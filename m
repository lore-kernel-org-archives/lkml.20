cgwb_kill() takes an offline memcg's wbs out of bdi->cgwb_tree, but
inodes that are still being dirtied stay attached to them. When a
replacement container keeps appending to those files, its foreign
flushes fail with -ENOENT in wb_get_lookup(), and it sleeps in
balance_dirty_pages() for seconds to minutes.

Keep killed wbs in bdi->cgwb_tree until they are released, so that
cgroup_writeback_by_id() finds them through the regular lookup. The
creation paths skip dying wbs, and a new wb takes over the slot of a
dying one when a live memcg's blkcg association changes; release only
removes a wb that still owns its slot. The blkcg association check
moves from wb_get_lookup() to the creation side: once a memcg with io
enabled is removed, cgroup_get_e_css() returns an ancestor's io css
and its dying wb would not match.

With commit 168a8c13159c ("writeback: size foreign flushes by target
wb dirty pages"), the flush is then sized from the wb's own dirty
pages and writes out what the replacement dirtied.

Test, on top of that commit: a cgroup appends to 1000 files at
250MiB/s and is removed, then a second cgroup keeps appending to the
same files under a 4G parent limit. Worst lag of the second writer
behind schedule over 120s, in three runs:

  without this patch   85.3s  46.9s  52.1s
  with this patch       1.0s   1.0s   1.4s

At Honeycomb, a container that reads from Kafka and writes columnar
files to a host volume stalls for 30-60s after each deploy replaces it
(v6.18). We're increasingly confident this is the cause: the stall
looks the same as in the reproducer (little CPU use, lag growing
linearly and then recovering), and the mitigation it predicts, moving
our final syncfs after the last write, worked in production (below).
We haven't caught it with probes in production yet.

Based on vfs-7.4.misc, next to Xin Yin's 168a8c13159c, which fixes the
sizing but not the lookup of a removed cgroup's wb. Each helps without
the other; this one also applies cleanly to mainline. On mainline
(fd179f8a05be), without 168a8c13159c, the test from the changelog gave
52.8s, 73.3s and 5.2s worst lag before this patch and 3.9s, 1.0s and
1.0s after.

Trigger: a cgroup dirties files and is removed while they are still
dirty; a sibling keeps appending to the same files under a parent memory
limit. Symptom: cgroup_writeback_by_id() returns -ENOENT and the sibling
stalls in balance_dirty_pages(). Minimal recipe below; the harness that
produced the numbers (paced writer, lag per second, MODE=alive control)
is at https://gist.github.com/lizthegrey/2209d831930588f63076bdc0ac7b78e2.

Syncing before the removal isn't enough: cleanup_offline_cgwbs_workfn()
skips a dying wb with any dirty inode and only retries on the next memcg
offline. On ext4, syncfs can leave inodes I_DIRTY_SYNC: at 5000 files
one syncfs still stalled in 7 of 9 runs (19-26s worst lag), a second
syncfs avoided it in 5 of 5, and with this patch one syncfs lagged at
most 1.5s in 3 of 3. On XFS one syncfs left the wb clean in 5 of 5 runs,
but a single 4KiB append from the old cgroup after it stranded the wb
again (15-28s worst lag, 5 of 5; 1.0-1.1s with this patch). In
production, our writer synced after closing its data files but before
writing its final Kafka offset to a small shutdown file, and moving the
syncfs after that write mitigated the stall for us on XFS. In the
reproducer, a 14-byte file written after the syncfs stranded the wb the
same way, whether created directly or via a temp file and rename (16-29s
worst lag, 7 of 7; 1.1-1.2s with this patch); an empty file did not.

Harness settings for all numbers: MEM_MAX=max POD_MAX=4G RATE_MBPS=250,
plus NFILES=5000 SYNC_OLD=1 (or 2) and DIRTY_AFTER=1 or
SHUTDOWN_FILE=offset|offset_rename|empty for the syncfs runs and
NFILES=500000 OLD_SECS=120 SYNC_OLD=1 POD_HOP=10 for the 500k-file runs.

Also reproduced unpatched on bare-metal arm64 with Ubuntu's 7.0 kernel
(ext4 on a loop device): 12.9s worst lag with the old cgroup removed,
2.5s with it kept.

Tested: arm64 KVM guests (virtme-ng), ext4 and XFS on virtio. No KASAN,
lockdep, PROVE_RCU, DEBUG_LIST, DEBUG_OBJECTS_WORK, DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP
or DEBUG_PAGEALLOC reports, including a stress run toggling io on the
parent of two writers 40 times so their wbs are killed and replaced in
the same slot (160 takeovers, checked with temporary trace_printk()s).
W=1 and checkpatch --strict clean, no new sparse warnings. All changes
are under CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK; only arm64 builds with it enabled
were done for v2.

Not tested: x86 runtime, this patch in production, linux-next.

Workaround until this lands: syncfs after the old container's last
write (twice on ext4). Lowering vm.dirty_expire_centisecs from 3000 to
500 cut the worst lag on unpatched mainline to 4.8s, 4.6s and 14.3s, but
did not remove the stall.

Related: without 168a8c13159c the flush is sized from the dead memcg's
own dirty pages, so this only helps while it has some. f6988c90671e
(mainline) also matters: on XFS with 500k synced inodes and the pod
cgroup removed 10s later, the handover was slow enough without it that
the replacement fell 21-22s behind (vfs-7.4.misc), against 1.0-1.2s
with it (mainline).

Not covered: when a live memcg's blkcg association changes, the new wb
takes over the slot, and a killed wb with dirty inodes is unreachable
again, as before this patch.

Developed with Claude Opus 5.5, which wrote the code, the reproducers
and first drafts of this text, and ran the builds and VM tests. I drove
the investigation from the production symptoms, designed the
experiments and controls (repeated runs, parent-commit baselines,
testing this patch on its own), and reviewed the analysis, code and
results.

Minimal recipe:
	#!/bin/bash
	# As root, cgroup v2, in a directory on ext4/xfs/btrfs ($DIR).
	cg=/sys/fs/cgroup/wbmini
	mkdir $cg && echo +memory > $cg/cgroup.subtree_control
	echo 4G > $cg/memory.max
	mkdir $cg/old $cg/new
	append() {  # append $1 blocks of $2 to each of 1000 files
		for i in $(seq 1000); do
			dd if=/dev/zero of=$DIR/f$i bs=$2 count=$1 \
			   oflag=append conv=notrunc status=none
		done
	}
	(echo $BASHPID > $cg/old/cgroup.procs
	 append 8 1M            # old owner writes the files...
	 append 1 64k)          # ...and exits with all of them dirty
	rmdir $cg/old           # its cgroup goes away while they are dirty
	bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:cgroup_writeback_by_id { @ret[(int32)retval] = count(); }' &
	sleep 3
	time (echo $BASHPID > $cg/new/cgroup.procs
	      append 4 1M)      # replacement keeps appending to the same files
	kill -INT $!; wait
	rmdir $cg/new $cg
	# Unpatched: many @ret[-2] (-ENOENT) and the append stalls.
	# Patched: @ret[0] only.
