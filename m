Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] KVM: arm64: timers: Program CVAL from the current count when the hardware won't apply the offset

Hi folks,

Changes since v1 [1]:
  - Patch 3 programs the new case's CVAL as an absolute value near the
    wrap instead of a negative TVAL, so a host stall between the
    counter and timer writes can't make it fire. (Sashiko)

A guest timer can fail to fire, or fire early, once the guest's counter
is far enough from the host's. Where the hardware won't apply the
offset itself (the physical timer without CNTPOFF_EL2, a CNTPOFF_EL2
host while TGE is set, the virtual timer on x1e), KVM adds it to CVAL
and lets the hardware compare the sum against the raw counter. The
timer condition is an unsigned compare, and adding the offset to both
sides of it preserves it only while both sums wrap or neither does: a
guest whose counter is ahead of the host's by more than CVAL has an
expired timer that never fires, and one behind it can have a far-future
timer fire at once.

Patch 1 computes the programmed value from the current count instead,
and returns a guest hypervisor's own physical CVAL from memory where it
used to subtract the offset from the hardware value. Patch 2 does the
same for the virtual CVAL read on x1e, which has returned CVAL + offset
since the workaround landed. Patch 3 adds the second case, a guest
behind the host with a far-future timer, to arch_timer_edge_cases.

So far it has only shown up in the selftest, which moves the guest
counter half its range away from the host's. On a VHE host without
CNTPOFF_EL2 arch_timer_edge_cases hangs in its physical cval = 0 cases
until the vCPU is next loaded, which is what Zenghui saw on a
Kunpeng920 [2]. On a CNTPOFF_EL2 host (QEMU, here) the same cases
livelock instead. Both go away with patch 1. The arithmetic is wrong
for any offset once one sum wraps and the other doesn't, and the fix
for the selftest's case should be the fix for all of them.

Tested with arch_timer_edge_cases on QEMU with [3], which has since been
merged, under VHE, nVHE and pKVM, and under VHE with CNTPOFF_EL2 removed
by id_aa64mmfr0.ecv=1, the host class Zenghui hit. Under VHE with patch
1 reverted the new case fails. QEMU's TCG had a separate bug with the
same offsets, which [3] fixes. Without it the test stalls under nVHE and
pKVM as well, where KVM emulates the physical timer and patch 1 changes
nothing. Not exercised here: patch 1's x1e paths in timer_save_state()
and timer_restore_state() and all of patch 2, since nothing here runs on
an x1e, and patch 1's CNTP_CVAL_EL0 read in kvm_hyp_handle_timer(),
which only a guest hypervisor with a physical offset on a host without
CNTPOFF_EL2 reaches.

Patch 1 carries Cc: stable for the hang and the livelock.

Based on Linux 7.3-rc3 (fd73f4a665989; also applies to kvmarm/next
f91b534e81f23).

Cheers,
