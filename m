Thanks for your patches! I have reviewed and tested them and the only
thing I noticed is that wrapping the resume/suspend methods with pm_ptr
is missing in the final patch. Otherwise everything LGTM.

I will follow up with v6 soon, adding you with "Co-developed-by" on
the relevant commits.

Best regards
Aaron

Ack. I think this is better suited for a separate patch series, unless it
is trivial to add.

Ack. I will look into this for v6.
