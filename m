That says what you are doing, but not _WHY_ you are doing it.  Why is
rcu needed here?  That feels very odd for something like a LED, why
isn't the normal device lifetime rules applicable here which would
require RCU to somehow be added just for this?

This is obviously LLM generated, please start from scratch and rewrite
this whole changelog on your own.

Great, then add the proper static checking for this state so that the
tools catch it when someone does not do that.

"set" and "on"?  Naming is hard :)

Look at how this is used:

"Set" and "false"?  So you don't want to set anything?

Again, naming is hard, the original code here was obvious what was
happening, LED_OFF is self-describing.  Your change is now not that.
