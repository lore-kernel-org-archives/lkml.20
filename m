Oh yes, we need this whatever you term as "duplication". I would argue
against terming it as duplications as if you look at the various SMCCC
based specification, we have zero consistency in how the VERSION command
is expected to work. The only consistency is returning
SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED if not supported and that's the max a generic
SMCCC bus code can check. All other details need to be deferred to the
individual SMCCC drivers.

Are you referring to the SMCCC bus code or RSI in particular above. I don't
see any issue with SMCCC bus code check as that is the least we can do and
must not change with future versions of the firmware as well.


If it is specific to RSI and the driver supports v2.0 and the firmware
is upgraded to v3.0, it really depends on what the v3.0 firmware returns
in these 2 values:
Lower RsiInterfaceVersion : Lower supported interface revision
Higher RsiInterfaceVersion : Higher supported interface revision

If lower is also set at v3.0, then I would argue it is firmware upgrade
issue expecting old kernel with old RSI version supported to work. If
that returns v2.0, the driver must work IIUC. Aneesh, hopefully I got this
right ?
