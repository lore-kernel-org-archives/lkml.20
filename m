- [High] peak_pci_remove() can still hit a use-after-free after this
  patch.

Pre-existing issues:
- [High] The failure_remove_channels cleanup in peak_pci_probe() reads
  chan->pciec_card from freed memory.
- [High] When channel 0's register_sja1000dev() fails on a PCAN-
  ExpressCard, peak_pci_probe() never cleans up the ExpressCard context.

can: peak_pci: Fix potential use-after-free during removal

This patch moves unregister_sja1000dev() ahead of peak_pciec_remove() in
peak_pci_remove(). The first channel's write_reg callback,
peak_pciec_write_reg(), then still has a valid ExpressCard context and I2C
adapter when set_reset_mode() writes the controller reset register.

[Severity: High]
Can peak_pciec_led_work() still read a freed net_device during removal?
This ordering also seems to make the window wider.

peak_pciec_probe() stores a raw pointer for every channel. Nothing clears
it when the channel is freed:

    card->channel[card->chan_count++].netdev = dev;

peak_pciec_led_work() dereferences each of those pointers. It re-arms
itself every second while any channel is up:

    netdev = card->channel[i].netdev;
    if (!netdev || !(netdev->flags & IFF_UP))
        continue;
    ...
    if (netdev->stats.rx_bytes != card->channel[i].prev_rx_bytes) {
    ...
    if (up_count)
        schedule_delayed_work(&card->led_work, HZ);

The loop in peak_pci_remove() walks from the last channel back to
channel 0. Channels N..1 go through unregister_sja1000dev() and
free_sja1000dev() first.

The only cancel_delayed_work_sync() on led_work is in
peak_pciec_remove()->peak_pciec_stop_led_work(). That runs only on
channel 0's iteration.

On a two-channel ExpressCard with channel 0 up, this is the sequence
after this patch:

peak_pci_remove()
  free_sja1000dev(ch1)            <- card->channel[1].netdev now dangling
  unregister_sja1000dev(ch0)
    set_reset_mode()
      peak_pciec_write_reg()      <- bit-banged I2C LED write
    unregister_candev()           <- RTNL, close, synchronize_net(), ...
  peak_pciec_remove()
    cancel_delayed_work_sync()

Before this patch, only dev_info() ran between free_sja1000dev(ch1) and
cancel_delayed_work_sync(). Now the whole unregister of channel 0 runs in
between. During that time the 1 Hz work can fire and read
card->channel[1].netdev->flags and ->stats from freed memory.

The commit aims to fix use-after-free during removal. Could the teardown
be restructured to fix this as well, for example:

  1. unregister all channels,
  2. call peak_pciec_remove(),
  3. free the net_devices.

Cancelling led_work, or clearing card->channel[i].netdev, before the
first free_sja1000dev() would also close this.

The probe error path in peak_pci_probe() has the same ordering. The
failure_remove_channels loop frees every net_device before
peak_pciec_remove() cancels led_work.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the
failure_remove_channels path in peak_pci_probe() seems to have the same
chan-after-free pattern that commit 949fe9b35570 fixed in
peak_pci_remove():

drivers/net/can/sja1000/peak_pci.c:peak_pci_probe() {
    ...
	chan = NULL;
	for (dev = pci_get_drvdata(pdev); dev; dev = prev_dev) {
		priv = netdev_priv(dev);
		chan = priv->priv;
		prev_dev = chan->prev_dev;

		unregister_sja1000dev(dev);
		free_sja1000dev(dev);
	}

	/* free any PCIeC resources too */
	if (chan && chan->pciec_card)
		peak_pciec_remove(chan->pciec_card);
    ...
}

chan points into the net_device private area: alloc_sja1000dev() sets
priv->priv to just past struct sja1000_priv. After the last iteration,
chan points into channel 0's freed allocation.

Is chan->pciec_card then read from freed memory and passed to
peak_pciec_remove()? That function calls cancel_delayed_work_sync(),
i2c_del_adapter() and kfree() on it.

This path is reachable on any multi-channel board when
alloc_sja1000dev(), peak_pciec_probe() or register_sja1000dev() fails for
channel i >= 1. Channels 0..i-1 are already registered at that point.

[Severity: High]
This is also a pre-existing issue, but what happens on a PCAN-ExpressCard
when register_sja1000dev() fails for channel 0?

For i == 0, peak_pciec_probe() has already done three things:

  - allocated the card,
  - registered the bit-banging adapter with
    i2c_bit_add_bus(&card->led_chip),
  - set chan->pciec_card.

The error path then does:

failure_free_dev:
	pci_set_drvdata(pdev, chan->prev_dev);
	free_sja1000dev(dev);

failure_remove_channels:
	...
	chan = NULL;
	for (dev = pci_get_drvdata(pdev); dev; dev = prev_dev) {
	...
	if (chan && chan->pciec_card)
		peak_pciec_remove(chan->pciec_card);

For channel 0, prev_dev is NULL, so drvdata becomes NULL. The loop body
never runs, chan stays NULL, and peak_pciec_remove() is skipped.

Does this leak the card? It also seems to leave the "peak_i2c" adapter
registered after cfg_base has been unmapped with pci_iounmap() and the
PCI device has been disabled.

The adapter's pita_setsda(), pita_setscl(), pita_getsda() and
pita_getscl() callbacks access card->cfg_base. A later transfer on the
adapter, for example through /dev/i2c-N, would touch unmapped MMIO. After
rmmod, the adapter would still point into the unloaded module.
