I discussed internally, and we suggest to add ieee80211_wake_queues() and
clear queue_stopped flags in rtw_pci_start().

This can resolve two cases -- restart_hw and interface down/up while
queue_stopped is flagging. Just like initialize or reset to variables.=20

No need 3 steps I mentioned. (So I'd not reply your trace.)

So there is no solution for now. Since 3th and 4th events will stop/start
pci, if the cause to fail to recovery is flagged queue_stopped, our above
idea will be helpful.=20

Another test is to remove/insert driver ko. It will reset queue states.

(I suppose you did these tests without changing any behavior as was).

I need your help to summarize the dumps. I don't have much time to analyze=

them. Sorry.=20
