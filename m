I suspect that the combination of a shared interrupt and runtime pm
is moderately rare and even when it is there are drivers doing their
own tracking to avoid this sort of corner case.

There are a lot of these nasty corners in runtime pm :(

This seems like a reasonable solution to me, but given
all the discussion on this version was around this patch I'm going
to pick up 1-9 to but ask you to send a new version of this one to
make sure we get maximum eyes on it.  Please include the PM maintainer
as well in the +CC in case we have this all wrong!

:)

I've vaguely be wondering if we need a bunch of self test + examples
to poke all the more crazy corners of runtime pm.  That way we can
at least be sure that if we do finally understand it we aren't going
to get any regressions.
