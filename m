It actually still hangs in here:

     For an active iWarp connect that is still waiting for the MPA reply
     (e.g. the peer accepted the TCP connection, but never answers the
     MPA request), irdma doesn't flush the marker before the pending
     connect is aborted, which only happens in rdma_destroy_id().
     smbdirect_socket_destroy_sync() calls ib_drain_qp() before that, so
     it waits forever:

       __ib_drain_sq+0x139/0x1b0 [ib_core]
       ib_drain_sq+0x7f/0x90 [ib_core]
       ib_drain_qp+0x16/0x40 [ib_core]
       smbdirect_socket_destroy_sync+0x2bd/0xa90 [smbdirect]
       smbdirect_socket_release+0x61/0xb0 [smbdirect]
       smbd_get_connection+0x22c/0x280 [cifs]


Here's my work in progress branch to fix these problems:
https://git.samba.org/?p=metze/linux/wip.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/for-7.3/rdma-backport-testing
There I'm able to eliminate all hangs I was able to reproduce with siw, rxe, iw_cxgb4, irdma, mlx5_ib.
I tested the following situations:
- server iptables drop (port 5445 and 4791)
- server nc -lk 5445 (tcp connection accepted by no responses)
- ip address del (on the client)
- ip link down (on the client)

It likely takes a while until I rechecked all commits
and submit them in small chunks, but it's good to see
that it's possible to avoid deadlocks or very large timeouts.

So at least that patch doesn't solve all problems.
