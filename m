I do agree with you; this is a different type of threat model that's 
being addressed.

The problem I see is that in today's day it's incredibly easy to hotplug 
an external PCIe device and not "realize" that it's malicious.  For 
example if I leave a dock on my desk and someone inserts malware into it
I might think it's perfectly fine.

The current mitigation that exists is that in the Linux ecosystem we 
don't turn on PCIe tunneling "automatically" unless the IOMMU is active.

Nominally this happens by way of 'bolt' userspace writing a sysfs file 
after it confirmed IOMMU was enabled both pre-boot and by the kernel.

But come back to me being a user.  If I have the IOMMU off already for
whatever reason I'm used to plugging in the dock and accepting the popup 
asking me to authorize it.  Now a malicious device comes along, that's 
on me to know about?

I feel it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility that such a 
malicious device could subvert lockdown (let alone other bad things that 
can happen).

Thus; lockdown is a very convenient tie in to claim security of the 
system against both user and hardware attacks.

Right.

How would you feel about at least blocking the user from turning off 
IOMMU (if it's present on the system) via the kernel command line while 
lockdown was enabled?

Thinking about the case where most distros enable lockdown by default, 
this will strenghten it's use without much downside that I can see.

At least on a properly configured system that contains an IOMMU it would 
prevent a user from subverting lockdown with a malicious device during 
the boot sequence.
