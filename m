Thanks Robin.

Yes, those are the possible options, last one requiring a look-up
from fwnode to the data providing GSI numbers/flags for that specific
fwnode - we do have that for IORT but I need to check for other
devices.

To be honest, I implemented the three of them while prototyping, it is just
a matter of choosing which one we want to support to sort this out.

Thanks !
