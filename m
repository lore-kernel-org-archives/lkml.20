DRBD 9's utilities need the multi-peer administration model that the
version-1 wire cannot express: peers identified by node id, several
paths per connection, per-peer-device options and statistics, and
notifications for all of those. Rather than bump the "drbd" family
and break every existing drbd-utils, add a second family, "drbd2",
written as a YNL specification in Documentation/netlink/specs/ and
following current generic netlink conventions: strict policies with
ranges, nested objects, split do/dump ops, extended ACKs for errors,
and a proper uapi header.

drbd2_nl_gen.[ch] and include/uapi/linux/drbd2.h are generated from
the spec with tools/net/ynl and are not edited by hand.
drbd_nl_drbd2.c is the struct drbd_nl_dialect adapter for the family.
Both families are registered by the same driver and operate on the
same objects; a resource created through either is visible through
both, within what each wire format can express. drbd2 is always
registered, so with DRBD_COMPAT_84=n it is the only family.

+ * The "drbd2" generic netlink family: everything that knows about the

+ * themselves live in drbd_nl.c and only ever see a struct drbd_adm_ctx.
+ *
+ * Unlike the legacy "drbd" family, drbd2 has no fixed message header and
+ * no place to carry a drbd_ret_code, so the outcome of a request is split
+ * in two, as the specification prescribes:
+ *
+ *   - A state change reports its drbd_state_rv in the state-result
+ *     attribute of the reply, together with the accumulated info messages
+ *     in message. A refused state change is data, not a transport error.
+ *   - Everything that failed for a configuration reason (the ERR_* codes)
+ *     becomes an errno plus a description in the extended ACK, and no
+ *     reply is sent at all.
+ *
+ * The description in the extended ACK is the command's own account of the
+ * failure where it left one -- the first of the info messages the core
+ * collected, formatted into the ACK's buffer so that it outlives the
+ * command context -- and the generic text of the ERR_* code otherwise.
+ * Failures that are about one attribute of the request also name that
+ * attribute, the way the netlink policy checks do. Further info messages
+ * are lost on the errno path; the reply of a completed command carries
