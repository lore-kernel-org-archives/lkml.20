Other than Kdump, kernel shouldn't try to touch these metadata pages
unless there is a kernel bug ?

And the userspace wouldn't have a mapping for them anyways ?

True.

We could explore that option for the kernel allocations too.

There is a --no-mmap option for makedumpfile in the worst case.

Agree. We definitely need this for kdump handling.
