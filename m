I was a little confused about the provenance of this patch.  It
*looks* like it should have been posted somewhere by Ilpo and
something tweaked by Mani when applying, but none of the links above
are a posting of this patch.  I dug around and found
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230918131103.24119-4-ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com/,
and this patch looks like basically the aspm.c part of it, so I assume
that should probably be the https://patch.msgid.link/?

To fix the provenance and the "Drivers can controlling" typo mentioned
by Ilpo, I replaced this with just the aspm.c changes from
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230918131103.24119-4-ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com/
and added the CONFIG_PCIEASPM dependency to the commit log.  The code
change is the same.
