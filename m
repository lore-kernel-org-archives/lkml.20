Every futex wait and wake takes the futex hash bucket's lock, and an
io_uring event loop arms a new one-shot wait after every wakeup.  On
PREEMPT_RT the lock sleeps, so a lower-priority task waiting or waking
on the same word, or on any word in the same bucket, can be preempted
holding it.  Priority inheritance lifts it only to the real-time
waker's priority, which loses to the interrupt threads above that on
the holder's CPU, and the real-time waker waits.

Look the futex up once and keep what the lookup found, the way io_uring
already keeps files and buffers:

 - IORING_REGISTER_FUTEX registers a table of futex words with the
   waker's ring, as IORING_REGISTER_FILES2 does files, sparse if asked;
   IORING_REGISTER_FUTEX_UPDATE replaces slots of it, as
   IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE2 does, and IORING_UNREGISTER_FUTEX drops
   it.

 - IORING_OP_FUTEX_WAIT with IORING_FUTEX_PERSISTENT arms a wait that
   stays armed until cancelled, in a slot of the ring's that
   sqe->file_index names as it does a direct descriptor's: index + 1,
   or IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC for a free one, returned in res.

 - IORING_OP_FUTEX_WAKE with IORING_FUTEX_REGISTERED wakes the
   persistent waits on registered slot sqe->buf_index's word whose
   bitset matches sqe->addr3.  Each posts one CQE with
   IORING_CQE_F_MORE, and posts no more until IORING_OP_FUTEX_WAIT with
   IORING_FUTEX_REARM names its slot, as a close does; wakes in between
   are kept as one.

Wakers and waiters can be in different processes, so registering
and arming look the word up by its futex key, as futex(2) does, and
meet in one node per key.  A node outlives any one wait, unlike a
futex_q, so the nodes get a hash of their own, sized and hashed like
the futex hash, which also leaves the futex core untouched.  Only
registering, arming and teardown take its locks; registering and arming
need write access to the word, as a waker would.  A registered wake
reads the node from the ring's table, walks its waiters under RCU and
moves each with a cmpxchg, then sets the wait's bit in its ring's
pending bitmap and wakes the ring's task.  It does no key lookup, takes
no futex hash bucket and no lock that sleeps on PREEMPT_RT, and
allocates nothing.  The waker's store to the word and the waiter's link
onto the node are each followed by a full barrier, so either the wake
finds the waiter or the waiter sees the new value.

futex(2) is untouched: a persistent wait is not a futex_q, and a word
is used one way or the other.

The ring must be IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN, and a persistent wait
can't be linked or skip its successes.  A ring has as many wait slots
as its CQ has entries, since each wait needs room for a CQE.  Nodes,
waits and tables are freed after an RCU grace period.

This depends on "io_uring: don't let a preempted task_work add hold back
the wake up": the wake skips waking the ring's task when a task_work add
has already claimed that wake up.

Measured on a Jetson Orin Nano running for-7.4/io_uring with PREEMPT_RT
and the patch above, so both rows have its fixed wake up into the ring,
and the one-shot delays are the bucket lock's.  A real-time sender on
CPU 4 wakes a real-time receiver's event loop on CPU 5 every 500us.  On
CPUs 0 and 1, lower-priority processes wake and wait on the same word,
beside SCHED_FIFO 50 threads running 20us to 1ms bursts and interrupt
load.  Ten minutes and 1.2 million messages a run:

                        sends over  late by    late by
                           100us   over 100us  over 1ms   longest
  one-shot,   FIFO 40      10285      10348        76      3.5ms
  persistent, FIFO 40          0          0         0     30.5us

A 30s stress test, a SCHED_FIFO 40 waker waking a SCHED_FIFO 40 waiter
while two more threads arm and cancel persistent waits on the same word
as fast as they can, lost none of about 259,000 wakes, worst 25.5us.

This is to discuss the design, not to merge as is.  It works and
passes its tests on PREEMPT_RT, but it isn't polished.  The cover
letter has the background and the other options I looked at.

Open design questions:

 - Should futex(2) and persistent waits work on the same word?  As
   posted, a word is used one way or the other: FUTEX_WAKE doesn't see
   persistent waits and a registered wake doesn't see futex(2) waiters,
   so mixing them silently loses wakeups.  Interoperating is more code,
   but fewer gotchas.

 - Should wakes be ordered by the waiters' priority?  As posted, a wake
   walks the waiters in the order they armed, newest first.  The futex
   core sorts its waiters by priority when they queue
   (__futex_queue()).

 - Persistent waits need IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN, since their
   wakes are drained with the ring's local work.  That could be
   expanded to other rings if there's a use for it.

+ * io_futex_node, found by the word's futex key in a hash of io_uring's own,
+ * sized and hashed as the futex hash is, with a lock per bucket.  A bucket's
+ * nodes and their member lists change under its lock, which only arming,
+ * registering and teardown take.  Both need write access to the word, as a
+ * waker would.  A registered wake already holds the node:
+ * it walks the node's members under RCU and takes no lock and does no key
+ * lookup, so nothing a preempted low-priority waiter holds can delay it.
+ *
+ * None of this is in the futex hash.  A persistent wait is not a futex_q,
+ * futex(2) wakes don't see it, and a registered wake sees nothing else.
+ *
+ * Each member posts one CQE per arm.  Its state, changed by cmpxchg but for
+ * arming it and ending it:
+ *
+ *   ARMED	waiting; a wake moves it on			-> QUEUED
+ *   QUEUED	to be posted by the ring's task			-> FIRED
+ *   FIRED	CQE posted; a wake is remembered		-> MISSED
+ *   MISSED	re-arming moves it to QUEUED at once
+ *   DEAD	cancelled or ended; the final task work frees it
+ *
+ * Re-arming moves FIRED to ARMED and MISSED to QUEUED.
+ *
+ * Every wake that finds a member QUEUED sets the member's bit in its ring's
+ * pending bitmap and kicks the ring (io_ring_futex_kick()), not only the wake
+ * that moved it there.  Setting the bit is the whole of publishing it, one
+ * atomic, so a wake that moved it and was then preempted, a low-priority one
+ * on a busy CPU say, leaves nothing half done for later wakes, a real-time
+ * one included, to depend on.  The ring's task takes the bits when it runs
+ * its local work and posts their members, so persistent waits need
+ * IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN.  That also keeps the ring alive for a waker
+ * still under RCU: such a ring is freed only after a grace period.
