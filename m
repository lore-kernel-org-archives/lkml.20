We had one last_comp_version.

Now we have two last_comp_version, one for reading and one for writing.
We compare again the dtb version supported by our libfdt version.

This comes from the discussion [1]

Yes a tag is said related to a property if it is available after its FDT_PROP and
before the next FDT_PROP (other proterty) of FDT_BEGIN_NODE (subnode) for FDT_NODE_END
(end of node).

This is defined by "structured tag"

Devicetree Specification will be updated to have all of this documentation
available.

A current libfdt/dtc version cannot add tags which will be defined in the
future.

last_comp_version_w will be used by the future version to prevent this
kind of issue with old version.
