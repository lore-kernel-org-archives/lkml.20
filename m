I don't think "split lock detection" is a good example. We are discussing
virtualizing a feature, or allowing a feature to be exposed to non-TDX and TDX
guests. While "split lock detection" is not a virtualizable feature and how KVM
handles it is all about how KVM fixes the architectural flaw of it.

Generally, I agree with your point that we need to think at higher level before
KVM deciding to support virtualizing a feature. But after the generic level
consideration is done, there can be different orders:

1. allow a feature for non-TDX VMs and TDs at same time. i.e., in one patch or
in a single series.

2. allow a feature for non-TDX VMs first and then TDs. This can be due to by
that time TDX's spec for the feature has not been defined/finalized.

3. allow a feature for TDs first and then non-TDX VMs. This can be due to it
requires more effort/patches to support virtualizing a feature for non-TDX VMs.

Usually allowing a feature for TDs requires far less efforts than for non-TDX
VMs, because most of the virtualization work is done by TDX module. E.g., for
TDs, KVM usually only needs to add code to restore the host states that are not
restored by TDX module. However for non-TDX VMs, KVM needs to do more: emulate
the architectural behavior of the MSRs, context switch states, and the nested
handling, etc. It's likely that a series to enable a feature for non-TDX VMs
spends several Linux releases to finally get merged. Making TDX support depends
on it seems not that necessary.
