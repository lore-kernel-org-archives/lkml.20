From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

kvm_xen_inject_timer_irqs() can drop events if kvm_xen_set_evtchn()
fails transiently, as it can when a memslot is in the process of
being updated. Defer the delivery in that case by leaving
->arch.xen.timer_pending set, so that it gets retried.

If the shared_info cache has been deactivated (-EINVAL), clear
timer_pending — a halted vCPU would otherwise spin forever, as
kvm_cpu_has_pending_timer() aborts every block while nothing can
deliver the event — but keep timer_expires, so the GET_ATTR/SET_ATTR
migration flow still carries the event and re-fires it on re-arm.
If delivery fails with -EFAULT, the shared_info gfn is genuinely
unbacked and can never succeed: drop the event and complete the
timer rather than spin on it.

True Xen does not have this problem: the shared_info page is owned
by Xen and always exists, even when not mapped into the guest. The
equivalent for a KVM/Xen VMM is KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO_HVA,
which has no memslot dependency and is the recommended mode; this
fixes the legacy GFN mode, which xen_shinfo_test exercises.

Don't re-arm the hrtimer in the KVM_XEN_VCPU_GET_ATTR(TIMER) flush
while a delivery is still pending; a re-fired callback racing the
retry would deliver twice.

The drop is vanishingly rare upstream, but hangs roughly half of all
xen_shinfo_test runs once the following atomic SRCU conversion
widens the window; hence fixing it first.
