Sure, looks fine to me.

I also found it to be not-so-great to put "enabled" first, as it still
requires forward-references to "active" to cover it sufficiently.

Sure. There are probably some details that could be omitted from my
version. Frankly, some of those details are there because you asked for
them though...

> Here's my version of it:

Thanks! My general thoughts are:

1) I think your version adds a few things that are nice to have. For
   example, a better clarification of what "active" and "suspended" mean
   from both physical device level, and from abstract RPM meaning. (This
   may also be where you've insisted on "meta-state" as a term.	I don't
   agree that "meta" adds any value, but I won't insist.)

   I also think the "forbidden" implication is a good addition: "the
   ability to transition a device into the suspended meta-state via
   runtime PM must not be relied on for correctness" -- that's one
   reason I wanted to put allowed/forbidden up top; that it throws a
   wrench in many people's assumptions.

   You spend more time on dependencies. That's a good thing IMO.

2) I think your version adds some things that are undesirable for an
   intro. For one, it spends quite some time to talk about the pitfalls
   of a "disabled+active" device. I think this is not something that
   goes in an introduction, and is more of an anti-pattern. If we wanted
   to document anti-patterns, we could write another few essays, I'm
   sure... It's also somewhat covered in Section 5 already.

   You've also completely omitted describing reference counting. This is
   one of the most fundamental aspects of RPM, IMO. (OTOH, omitting API
   names is a fine choice.) I think your elaboration of "dependencies"
   is a good time to just break out a section on what constitutes "in
   use" -- get()/put() references, and dependents.

3) Lack of organizational clarity -- your version looks more like a wall
   of text essay, which IMO doesn't do so well at engaging introductory
   readers, or those skimming for one concept (e.g., "forbidden"). I
   still prefer the structure that clearly highlights the main topics,
   either with bullets or sections or something.

4) autosuspend -- I think it deserves a mention in the intro, even if
   it's a pointer to the existing section. Not sure if you meant to drop
   it.

5) Wordy. Your intro has about ~%50% more words. I think the same
   content could be represented more succinctly, to make for a better
   read.

...but:

6) It's better than not having this introduction at all!

So aside from the general thoughts above, I will:

(a) add minimal direct feedback to the text below, in case you'd still
    prefer taking a variation of your content. That would be OK with me.

(b) provide my own adaptation of my writing + your writing at the end,
    in case you'd rather try that.

I think listing the concepts at the top helps, as a sort of introductory
paragraph/sentence to the following wall of text and/or bullets.

Also, super-nits: you seem to wrap at about 70 chars, while most of this
doc (and other docs, I think) wraps at around 78-80.

I also see a difference on two spaces after periods or not. I guess most
of this doc uses two, even though that's not the dominant style these
days. I'll try to stick with two spaces now that I noticed. (Fun fact:
it seems browsers automatically collapse these to one space, when
viewing the generated HTML.)

Somewhat nitpick: everything else seems to call it "runtime PM status"
or similar, not "runtime PM state". `enum rpm_status`, most of the
existing doc language, the 'power.runtime_status' field, etc.

I'm not sure "analogously" is the right word here. It seems like you're
going for "additionally" or some other similar word.

Like I said above, I like that you went into more detail on
dependencies. But I think this is a pretty divergent train of thought.
In my edited version below, I chose to break it out into a new
bullet/section, kept after the first 3.

I think most of this paragraph is a bit too much, and is easily derived
from just explaining that "most start disabled; some buses (like PCI)
make more initial choices for you; choose accordingly".

I'm also not sure what the "black box" mention adds on top of the
earlier, "If it is **disabled**, it generally leaves the device alone."

I still think autosuspend belongs in the intro, even if only to link to
the existing section. (I also think the "auto" vs "autosuspend"
disambiguation is important, but I'm also open to moving that part to
Section 9 or similar.)

I'm obviously biased, but I think there's room for improvement. I'm
providing my adaptation of your text below, but I'm also open to yours
however you see fit. Like I said, one of these options is better than
none.

Let me know if I should send the below in v4, or else please mail your
own for review!

Runtime PM operates around a few device-level concepts — whether a device is
**active** or **suspended**; whether runtime PM is **enabled** or **disabled**;
whether runtime PM is **allowed** or **forbidden**; and whether a device is "in
use."

* **Active**: Runtime PM tracks whether or not devices are in active use, which
  generally means that they are accessible and operational, and may be depended
  on by something (for example, other devices or user space).  This is
  represented by the **active** meta-state.  By contrast, the **suspended**
  meta-state represents a promise that the given device will not be accessed.
  This covers devices in low-power states, but it also may include devices that
  are not fully operational.  There are also two transient meta-states,
  **suspending** and **resuming**, representing transitions between **active**
  and **suspended** often referred to as *runtime suspend* and *runtime
  resume*, or just *suspend* and *resume*, respectively.  Every device handled
  by runtime PM is in one of these four meta-states at any time, and its
  meta-state is expected to reflect its actual physical configuration (that is,
  for instance, if the device is not accessible, it must not be **active**).
  The term "runtime PM status" used in what follows refers to the meta-states
  described above.

* **Enabled**: In order to track the runtime PM status and carry out
  transitions between **active** and **suspended**, runtime PM needs to be
  **enabled** for the given device.  If it is **disabled**, runtime PM
  generally leaves the device alone.  This means in particular that the runtime
  PM status of a device and its actual physical configuration may get out of
  sync after disabling runtime PM for it.  Additionally, the runtime PM status
  of a device may need to be explicitly adjusted to reflect its current
  physical configuration before enabling runtime PM for it (e.g., during device
  probe).  Once runtime PM is **enabled**, it begins managing PM status —
  performing *runtime suspend* and *runtime resume* transitions based on its
  understanding of whether a device is in use.

  As a rule, all devices are initialized with runtime PM **disabled**, though
  some bus types (such as PCI) manage some RPM initialization automatically,
  and therefore probe devices in an **enabled** state.  For other devices,
  drivers must enable runtime PM on their own to opt in.

* **Allowed**: Runtime PM may be **forbidden** even though it has been enabled.
  Doing so causes the given device to transition into the **active** meta-state
  and prevents it from being suspended.  In other words, a device with
  forbidden runtime PM remains **active** at least until runtime PM is
  **allowed** for it again.  This mechanism can be managed by in-kernel APIs,
  but more importantly, it is also available to user space via the
  ``/sys/devices/.../power/control`` sysfs attribute of the given device.
  Namely, writing ``on`` to that attribute forbids runtime PM, and writing
  ``auto`` allows it.  User space may modify that attribute at any time, so the
  ability to transition a device into the **suspended** meta-state via runtime
  PM must not be relied on for correctness.

* **In use**: Runtime PM determines whether a device should be transitioned to
  an **active** state by its understanding of whether a device is in use.  The
  first way a device is considered **in use** is by its own usage count — a
  reference counter driven by a variety of get()/put() APIs.  Additionally, a
  device may be considered **in use** by having active dependents — either
  child devices, or device-linked consumers.  When a device is no longer in
  use, runtime PM may choose to transition it to the **suspended** state.

  Thus, when a device moves from a **suspended** to an **active** state, it may
  also cause its dependencies to resume.  Conversely, suspending a device may
  also cause its otherwise-unused dependencies to suspend.

* **Autosuspend**: Runtime PM also supports a feature called "autosuspend."
  This is different than the ``control`` notion of "auto" (i.e., **allowed**).
  Autosuspend is covered in `Section 9`_.
