Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Keep the secondary and subordinate bus numbers that the previous kernel
programmed into bridges, rather than assigning new ones, if the previous
kernel preserved any device across a Live Update. Do this even on
architectures that would otherwise always assign bus numbers themselves,
e.g. when pci=assign-busses is passed.

Preserved devices must be allowed to continue performing memory
transactions across a Live Update, so the kernel cannot change the
fabric topology. Changing the bus numbers of a bridge changes the
RequesterIDs of the devices below it, which would require disabling and
flushing any in-flight memory transactions first.

Apply the policy globally rather than only to the paths that contain
preserved devices. Bus numbers have to be preserved above a preserved
device anyway, since an upstream bridge cannot expand its window. A
global policy matches the scope of pcibios_assign_all_busses(), and
gives an answer that cannot change part way through the two passes of a
bridge scan.

Bridges that do not have bus numbers are still assigned new ones, so
hot-adding a bridge keeps working, both during and after a Live Update.
The two-pass bridge scan guarantees such bridges are only assigned bus
numbers above those already claimed by preserved bridges.

The exception is a bridge that was preserved but comes up without a
valid bus number configuration, e.g. because it was reset during kexec.
Refuse to assign it new bus numbers, since that would silently change
the BDF of every preserved device in its hierarchy. Also refuse to
assign bus numbers to the other bridges on the same bus, since the bus
numbers of the failed bridge can no longer be read from hardware and
handing them out would let an unrelated device inherit the BDF of a
preserved device.

Require that CONFIG_CARDBUS is not enabled to enable
CONFIG_PCI_LIVEUPDATE since preserving bus numbers on PCI-to-CardBus
bridges requires additional work but is not a priority at the moment.
