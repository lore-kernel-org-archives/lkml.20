Subject: [PATCH v10 6/8] ALSA: usb-audio: add the Topping M62's port power settings

An M62 whose USB-C port the vendor's application has set to Off or
Discharge does not charge from the computer it is connected to, and
runs its battery down; nothing on Linux shows that setting or changes
it, nor the power of the OTG port. Both are kept in the card, and the
application offers them under Device.

Offer both as enumerated controls with the application's items: "USB-C
Port Power" (Charge, Discharge, Off) and "OTG Port Power" (Discharge,
Off), at 0x11/0x1c and 0x11/0x1b, in every mode.

Like every other value here, both are written at the first bind: the
USB-C port to Charge, so that a card left on Off or Discharge by another
host takes power from this one again, and the OTG port to Off, which
leaves a phone on it to its own battery rather than the card's.
alsactl's restore then puts back what the user chose. The card reports
both settings in its announce, and a report updates the control, as for
the volumes; but it sends each of the two once in an announce and leaves
one or both out of some announces, 13 of 120 in one run here, so the
announce cannot stand in for the write. The vendor application reads
them from the announce and never pushes them; a host that is to charge
the card cannot leave that to an announce that may not come.
