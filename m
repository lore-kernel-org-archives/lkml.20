What I get, is not matching VMX behavior but matching the behavior KVM 
will perform for VMX. They are based on the assumption that KVM will 
always enable the save/restore VMCS fields for a new feature. But I 
don't think we can guarantee it.

To me, "have TDX simply match VMX behavior" means:

1. if the VMX unconditionally save/restore a state, then TDX will do so.

2. if there are vm-entry/vm-exit load/save VMCS fields for a state, then 
provide the equivalent per-TD configurable interfaces which matches the 
VMCS fields.

IMO, allowing userspace to expose/enable a new feature to a guest 
without KVM first evaluating it is always dangerous. It's not just about 
the state clobbering. We can know the implication for a new feature.

For example, a feature consumes global per-socket resources. Allowing 
guest to use the feature might slowdown the host.

Another example is a feature is used to catch bad behaviors, and in this 
case host would like to enforce the feature being forced on for the 
guest instead of allowing the guest to use (disable) the feature freely.
