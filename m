Hi Anup,

Thanks for the detailed analysis and for proposing the direction. I=E2=80=
=99d=20
like to suggest a small refinement on top of your diff: add

if (READ_ONCE(tvcpu->cpu) =3D=3D vcpu->arch.last_exit_cpu)

here so that we only kick the vCPUs that are currently running on the=20
previous host CPU, while still setting tlb_sanitize_mask for all other=20
vCPUs. Would that be OK?

Regards,
Bill
