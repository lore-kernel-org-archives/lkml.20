(+CC Alan, since he wrote much of the autosuspend stuff, but also
because he might(?) have better context for some of the .runtime_idle()
+ pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() questions)

Hi Rafael,

I was a bit slow to respond here, because I wanted to consider this
carefully, and not simply give a knee-jerk reaction.

Overall, I have some positive and negative thoughts. I'm still leaning
toward preferring a proposal more like my own, but I think with a few
things cleared up, I may be convinced of yours instead.

Sure, that's one way to frame it.

I think "in some cases" is holding a lot of weight.

For every increased parent autosuspend delay, there is always some usage
pattern that will subvert it (even post-commit-55b2b8af704f) -- the
child simply needs to stay "in use" for a bit longer. We shouldn't have
to think about how long a device is in use when determining the
autosuspend delay.

So I think this is a non-starter line of thought, and not just because
of your system power arguments.

To me, autosuspend delay is simply broken today when looking at parent
devices. Maybe we can glean some intention from the comments and context
around any given delay used by drivers today, but they aren't reliably
meaningful.

I don't think we should be treating current autosuspend delays for
parent devices as meaningful at all, per the above. So I think this is a
chance to try to improve the architecture so it makes sense, and then
figure out if any existing delays should be tuned/reduced.

Ideally, yes, we can avoid making significant system power changes to
the negative, but I don't think that we should prioritize that above all
else, as long as it's *possible* to tune the autosuspend delays in a way
that makes sense.

Do we have any idea what the "other reasons" could be? For example,
because driver writers found it too difficult to find all the
appropriate places to call pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()? (Does commit
b3db492e8335 ("PM: runtime: Mark last busy stamp in
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()") help? Or should pm_runtime_put() behave
similarly?)

I'm genuinely interested. Because I think that you *might* be reasoning
us into a weird corner where we "hope" things can be improved
architecturally in the long run, but we don't really know, and aren't
going to actually make it happen without knowing why things are the way
that they are.

Side note: I think .runtime_idle() should be removed. As far as I can
tell, it's only used for working around architectural problems in
runtime PM (like $subject), or for implementing autosuspend without
actually using autosuspend (usually because they predated autosuspend).

At the same time, it makes it harder to reason about the runtime PM API
surface -- because currently, .runtime_idle() is a primary reason that
pm_runtime_put() and pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() are different. (A
secondary reason is the last_busy update -- which is exactly the problem
we're talking about here.)

I have some experimental patches to remove it entirely, but I wanted to
clear this obvious problem up first.

Maybe. I don't really like forcing driver writers to think about and opt
into yet another quirk of RPM, especially if we can reason out whether
the existing behavior is bad/quirky/broken, and that the new behavior is
in fact better. (Frankly, I don't like making driver writers think about
rpm_idle() at all. IMO, it makes more sense as an internal
implementation detail than as a part of the client API.)

If we go this route, would you be open to making it opt *out*, so
drivers can opt back out (hopefully with clearly-documented reasons we
can treat as problem reports) if necessary? Otherwise, I think we'll
have a hard time bringing drivers along, and instead we'll simply have a
more fragmented and confusing set of runtime PM features.

Yes, that would be very nice.

I also don't think drivers should ever have to think about the
difference between pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() and pm_runtime_put(),
although I think we can get there in other ways (removing
.runtime_idle(); rolling pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() into all the put()
helpers, or possibly to rpm_drop_usage_count()).

I'd agree, this sounds very nice, except for one concern:

"Last PM reference" can be a bit subtle; particularly, the child only
drops a reference on its parent once it *completes* autosuspend (even if
it was last "busy" much earlier). That means autosuspend delays become
additive along the hierarchy. Is that desirable?

Personally, I don't think so, and that's why I chose propagation (my
proposal), rather than extension (what I'd call the behavior you're
describing).

I also _think_ that's what Jonathan was saying here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261103231719.486a18de@jic23-hlaptop/
But I'm not quite sure, so I'll leave room for correction here.

And really, I think this is the main distinction between our proposals.
(The other is that you're proposing making this behavior conditional /
opt-in.)

To me, I think it's important to distinguish when the last real *use*
was, versus when the runtime PM framework (timers, etc.) hadn't yet
decided to suspend. Autosuspend is the trailing indicator, while
mark_last_busy() is the leading indicator.

Maybe I'm missing something though.

I think many of these simplifications/improvements you talk about are
good. I also don't really think they're unique to your described
solution; I think we can get many or most of them in other ways too.

For example, I think that with my propagation solution, we also can
likely reduce autosuspend delays for many of the same cases that could
be improved with yours, if that's deemed valuable.

Or if we really want to go all-out on reducing inconsistency in
mark_last_busy() placement: we could add pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()
into rpm_drop_usage_count().

I also would like to add / repeat a few questions:

What, specifically, do you think my proposal misses?
Too complex?
Doesn't go far enough on updating last_busy (e.g., with the
pm_runtime_allow() use cases)?
Wastes power? (In what ways relative to your proposal? Simply because
yours is opt-in?)
Something else?

Or because its concept is not good? For example, I don't think you
really addressed a question from a few replies up:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/auzlLwlleGLPsLcw@google.com/
Rephrased: why shouldn't the parent's last busy time be the same (or
later) than the child's?
Your proposal seems to achieve almost the same (in fact, it's more
aggressive), with slightly different means, and with more complexity for
users -- that everyone has to opt in, and to think about what rpm_idle
is.

And a similar theme for other unanswered questions:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/auzlLwlleGLPsLcw@google.com/
Why shouldn't pci_config_pm_runtime_put() (and similar) update
last_busy?

To me, if we can't properly address the question of "when should we
update last_busy?" (and instead defer to yet another opt-in feature
within runtime PM, without making sure everyone can use it), then I
think we'll never *really* move things forward.

(And to be clear: I'm not trying to ask these questions to drive "my
solution is better; why don't you agree?!" I just want to understand the
principles in the design, and in the decisions you'd like to make here,
so I can help make sure they do indeed make the driver experience
better, and that there is a good path to convergence.)
