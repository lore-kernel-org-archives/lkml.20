... till here - to me it feels like TMI
I don't think it helps to keep a description of the code in a text file
There is very little hope in getting them to stay in sync and very little
point to begin with. This list is not complete even now (e.g. fallocate)
nor should it be complete IMO.
If one wants to know what operations invalidate which attrs one can grep
for fuse_invalidate_attr_mask().
I think it is more important for the doc to explain the principles behind t=
he
attribute mask and give some examples. Something like:

FUSE uses fine-grained invalidation masks rather than invalidating all
attributes at once.
The principle is that each operation only invalidates the specific
attributes that the operation
could have changed on the server. The masks used are:

STATX_ATIME - after reads and readlink, since the server may update access =
time
STATX_CTIME - after xattr changes (including ACL set/remove) and rename
STATX_BLOCKS - after a successful flush with writeback cache, since
the server's block count may differ from the local one
FUSE_STATX_MODIFY (STATX_MTIME | STATX_CTIME | STATX_BLOCKS) - after
writeback completion (without writeback cache), since the server may
have updated modification metadata
FUSE_STATX_MODSIZE (FUSE_STATX_MODIFY | STATX_SIZE) - after writes,
truncate-on-open, and fallocate, since the server's size and
modification metadata may have changed
FUSE_STATX_MODDIR (FUSE_STATX_MODSIZE | STATX_NLINK) - after directory
modifications (create, unlink, mkdir, rmdir, rename), since the server
may have updated the directory's size, timestamps, and link count
STATX_BASIC_STATS - as a full invalidation, used for server-initiated
invalidation (FUSE_NOTIFY_INVAL_INODE), interrupted setattr, and
interrupted link
The full set of invalidation points can be found by searching for
fuse_invalidate_attr_mask() in the FUSE source.

Isn't this a private case which is already covered by the last item?

I think that both ->d_revalidate() and readdirplus could be generalized
to something like "Whenever attributes are refreshed from the server"

Because those specific cases are not related to ACL specifically,
they are related to attribute cache and to the unwritten dentry cache.

Again, the idea is to write a doc that explains the principles and is less
likely to get out of sync with the code.

It's fine to list d_revalidate and READDIRPLUS as examples to the
category, but as a comprehensive list of use caes, I think this is wrong.

AFAIK this is not what KEEP_CACHE means.
It means keeping the cache from the past opens for this open.
IIRC I gave the exact same comment in v2.
