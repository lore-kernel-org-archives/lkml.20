I just want to add that this work is mostly stale at the moment.  It was
decided that it needs to be done on top of fusex, the next major protocol
version bump.  Also note that the initial draft of fusex lacked a bunch of
features (e.g., it was available for local-filesystems only), so it may
take a while before a LOOKUP_HANDLE operation is available.
