I've been using the console for around 28 years, now.  I don't recall it
crashing at all.  My current font and keyboard files are in exactly the
same form as they were 28 years ago.  These formats are stable and
dependable.

Something like:

Other people, in particular Greg KH, have said this is the current aim.
I'm worried for myself.  It is far from clear that there is a suitable
replacement for the kernel's console, and its elimination could easily
happen without that replacement.  I suppose I could always (laboriously)
maintain the console for myself personally.  Or there's always the BSDs.
I just don't know what I'd do.

It's 2026, four decades after VGA was the latest thing, and Unicode
support is merely a nice-to-have?
