This patch is very large, which makes it fairly hard to review - a
danger with AI generated code.  However, from the premise there's not
an obvious (to me) logical way of splitting it up.  I'll see what
appears as I go through the implementation.

Hm, makes me realise we don't have information in the README about

Maybe it's just me, but I find it slightly confusing that both -b and
-o are controlling the output names.  I'd be inclined to drop -b and
always send the generated based dtb to <outdir>/base.dtb, at least for
this first patch introducing the tool.  After all, you can always mv
it afterwards.

Useful option, could be split to another patch to make this one less
huge.

Seems like something more for the test suite than built into the tool.

Something like --stats might be better for this.  -v tends to be more
for debugging / logging output.

I really don't like that idea.  You'd essentially be creating not
really valid dtbo files that will work by accident against one
specific base file.

That sounds like a useful extension for the future.  An interim step
would be to extend to instead of taking a bunch of dtbs as input, take
a single (already generated) base dtb and a bunch of dtbos.  You'd
leave the given base alone, but find further common things between the
dtbs, in the context of that base.  The idea is you'd run fdtfactor
once on the raw dtbs, then run it again on a subset of the dtbos
emitted from the first pass to find further commonalities in that
subset.

Hm, I'll have to see how this is actually used, but I'm generally a
bit leery (on non-Windows systems) of using the extension as anything
but a hint / default.

A "live" tree representation is the right data structure for this job.
On the other hand it's a pretty hefty piece of infrastructure to just
inline in this tool.

I'd suggest adding this as a preliminary patch, with a more trivial
test case (say round trip from dtb to dtb via the in-memory
representation).  Then introduce the actual fdtfactor logic to use it.

I gess it's what you need here, but "creating missing nodes" seems

Should probably be b'status' - property names aren't Unicode.

Again, path should be treated as a bytestring not a string - node
names are not Unicode.  At least, internally that should be the case.
Accepting a string and converting it to a bytestring would be fine.

Hmm.  The strip() here means it will ignore not just one, but any
number of leading or trailing '/'.  However, internal repeated '/'
will result in subnodes named '', which is not desirable.

Simpler and more consistent might be to drop the initial special case
handling of '/' and '' as full paths and instead go with:

	for part in path.split('/'):
	    if not part:
	        continue
	    . . .
	   =20

Traditionally the process of converting an in-memory device tree
representation to a dtb is referred to as "flattening".  So I'd
suggest maybe _flatten_subtree() for this.  As an internal function,
I'd also drop the default name=3D'' - it's rarely useful and incorrect
if called on anything except the root node.

That seems like a bug in FdtSw.as_fdt().  We should fix that, rather

Clumsier than I'd like, but that's the fault of the overlay format,

You already unflattened the tree, but deliberately excluded
__symbols__.  Both clearer and more efficient to *not* exclude it from
the unflattening, then read the symbols from the unflattened version,
rather than re-parsing.

Huh, __symbols__ typically won't have a phandle, but yeah, we can't
exclude the possibility.  Another ugliness in the overlay format.

It would be slightly less efficient, but I think recording the
phandles as a second pass rather than while you're parsing the
structure might be clearer.

You can use len() directly on prop, as a subclass of bytearray.

Wait... what?  You're not storing this as the NodeTree structure you

Why parallel maps for all these, rather than a single Node object?
Or NodeTree, since you have that already.

I'd *definitely* suggest that parsing symbols and fixups be handled in

'rel_path' is a bad name, since this is an absolute path in the tree.

Walking the whole tree, then looking up if it is in local_fixups seems
the wrong way around.  Better to walk local_fixups and go to the right

I don't love the name 'sym_props' here, since this is recording fixups
in the property, not symbols.  Also why store the masked property
value here in a tuple, rather than updating self.node[path][prop_name]
with the masked value?

Beware a wrinkle here.  dtbos have no way of deleting a property from
the base tree.  So if *any* of the input trees is missing the

AFAICT select_best_candidate() is always passed the same byte_len_fn,

And isn't this redundant with the above.  Could we instead return a
single dictionary: All common nodes get an entry, with 'None' as the
value if it doesn't need the phandle, or an actual value if it does
need a phandle.

I'm not sure why you care that all the copies of the property have
fixups.  AFAICT all you care about is that the set of fixups is
identical for all of them, empty or not.

True, but more generally 1) you can't make *any* property common if it
doesn't exist in all the inputs and 2) the fixups must be identical
for all inputs, empty or otherwise.

Using the NodeTree() representation only as an interim step to
flattening seems odd to me.  Either use NodeTree (or something like
it) throughout, or go directly from the internal cluster-of-maps
representation into a flattened tree.

I'd suggest always just using 'phandle' since that's the modern form.

Putting everything in /fragment@0 is kind of nasty.  It would be
preferable to search for useful places to put fragments across the
input dtbs.  But, I'm fine if that is a later improvement, rather than
the original version.

This creates what's arguably an invalid overlay - it assumes the value
of a phandle in the base tree.  I'd prefer to see this case rejected

diff_props is necessarily empty if not in_base_dtb, so the first term
is redundant.

Again, I'd suggest just standardising on the modern 'phandle'.

That's not right.  The overlay should only have a global
/__local_fixups__, there shouldn't be __local_fixups__ for individual
fragments.

These path =3D=3D '/' special cases appear in a bunch of places.  I think
you could avoid them all with some tweaks to your conventions about
paths (e.g. always keep them as relative paths to the root, allowing
'').

fdt testcases generally try to be minimal.  So, I'd suggest using a
contrived tree along the lines of test_tree1.dts, rather than a
realistic board tree like this one.  It does need an example of all
the cases that should be fixed up, of course.

I dislike tests comparing dts in general, since it's a highly
non-unique representation.  I much prefer to use the
dtbs_equal_ordered and dtbs_equal_unordered helpers.

I think it would be preferable to create a new group of tests for
fdtdactor, rather than lumping them in with fdtoverlay.
