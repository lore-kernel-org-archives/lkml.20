Yes, you'd expect the buddy allocator to combine the folios back into a
larger one if they were contiguous. I guess we should be safe, at least
for now. I still feel it's unnecessarily fragile and complex trying to
work out whether we've mapped as a huge page or not. But I don't
actually have a better solution at the moment, and this series is at
least improving things. I'll put it on my todo list to look at later.

Thanks,
Steve
