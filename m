The same.

Right, and my argument is that it's impractical and effectively

I don't think the PLLs are any special here. It just happened that
the special cases involved them. If we had OPP tables for PLLs, we'd
probably desire to keep *all* of the data in the DT (so also for all
the other clocks), and i don't want 50% of the DT to become clock data.

As you can guess, I don't like boardfiles in general too, but I think
containing that in the driver is the right choice here.

Yes, they are! The AHB/AXI clocks for example (at the very least for
camera).

That's already solved today, and as you said that's just a different
requirement.

Yes, but provided you have the data, with this patchset, you can look
at the known single source and relay its contents to the known single
place (the clock driver), letting the computer do the path traversal
and max() along the way.

That's unfortunately not a universal truth.

I think the most common case is "RCG needs CX and its direct child
branch needs MX at the same level" and the generator ends up treating
that as "RCG needs CX and MX" (which is totally fair). But again, RCGs
sourced from MX is also a valid config.

Lockdep didn't complain on SM8650 and Glymur. I'm assuming the only case
where it actually matters is that if the power-domain provider is
suspended and needs a clock to turn on before accessing it. But that'
not a problem on Qualcomm platforms and that case would have bigger
issues anyway..

Yes, that's actually the reason MMCX exists - so that the multimedia
power is wholly separate from the main rail.
