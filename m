From: Wayne Ho <wayneho219@gmail.com>

The delay_on and delay_off attributes created by the timer trigger and
the invert attribute created by the heartbeat and activity triggers
are not documented. They share their sysfs paths with the oneshot
trigger attributes, so adding a separate entry per trigger would make
get_abi.py warn about the same path being defined more than once.

Move the delay_on, delay_off and invert entries from
sysfs-class-led-trigger-oneshot to sysfs-class-led and describe the
behaviour of each trigger that creates them.

+Description:
+		This attribute is only present when the LED's trigger is
+		set to "oneshot", "heartbeat" or "activity". Any non-zero
+		value written is stored as 1, so reading it back returns
+		0 or 1.
+
+		For the "oneshot" trigger, reverses the blink logic. If set
+		to 0 (default) blink on for delay_on ms, then blink off for
+		delay_off ms, leaving the LED normally off. If set to 1,
+		blink off for delay_off ms, then blink on for delay_on ms,
+		leaving the LED normally on. Setting this value also
+		immediately changes the LED state.
+
+		For the "heartbeat" trigger, inverts the heartbeat pattern.
+		If set to 0 (default) the LED stays off most of the time and
+		blinks briefly on. If set to 1 the LED stays on most of the
+		time and blinks briefly off. Unlike "oneshot", the new value
+		only takes effect at the next phase of the pattern.
+
+		For the "activity" trigger, inverts the on/off states of the
+		CPU activity blink. If set to 0 (default) the LED is mostly
+		off when the system is idle and stays on longer as CPU usage
+		grows. If set to 1 the LED is mostly on when idle and stays
+		off longer as CPU usage grows. The new value only takes
+		effect at the next on/off transition.
+
+		This is unrelated to the /sys/class/leds/<led>/inverted
+		attribute, which is specific to the backlight trigger.
