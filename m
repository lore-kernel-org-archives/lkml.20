I can see these reasons for not seeing great improvements:
1. Timing of device offers from the host is beyond the control of guest 
and the Hyper-V host may also be serializing the requests from the host.
2. Shared locks that needs to be handled separately:
    * hyperv_mmio_lock during VMBus MMIO allocation.
    * pci_rescan_remove_lock during PCI resource assignment and device 
addition.


I digged more into it, and it is indeed because of late offers from 
Hyper-V. I was considering the start of first probe to the last return, 
for time calculations.

For the 4 PCI devices on my setup whose offers were delivered together, 
the performance improvement was about 24%. However with the last offer 
coming late for MLX PCI device, overall improvement in time was lesser 
in terms of percentage.

Dexuan had removed pci_rescan_remove_lock in his previous upstream 
attempt, but I ommitted it intentionally this time because from AI 
review, I saw a potential race condition that we would introduce if we 
remove it. Secondly, I did not observe any benefits of removing this 
lock. But I am going to revisit it again.
