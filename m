Not really - users of fdt_next_tag() will typically already have a
switch on the tag type, so the unknown tag handling would be an
addition to the 'default' case, not requiring an extra loop.

I'm not sure that's true of the (few) callers outside libfdt itself.

I'm not sure what you mean by "in loop" here.

Are symbol versions entirely unsupported with static libraries?
Obviously they'd have to be resolved at (static) link time, not
runtime, but I don't see that it's impossible.

I don't really follow what you're saying here.

I'm not sure it's that bad, since fdt_next_tag() loops will typically
already have a 'default' case for irrelevant tags, which will
generally be handled the same as unknown tags.

Yeah, I'm not really convinced by this one either.

I haven't thought of any more ideas yet.
