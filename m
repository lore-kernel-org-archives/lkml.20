Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/amd: Move NMI latency window to last-resort suppression
Date: Wed, 16 Sep 2026 14:57:23 +0800

The upstream amd_pmu_adjust_nmi_window() mitigation claims every NMI
that arrives within a 100ms window opened after a PMC overflow. When no
counter overflowed, the handler still returns NMI_HANDLED, which makes
the NMI dispatch path take its "handled" exit. Everything that comes
after the perf handler is then skipped: the NMI reason port, which may
hold a latched SERR#/IOCHK# error, and all NMI_UNKNOWN handlers, such
as hpwdt. As a result unrelated NMIs are silently dropped for the whole
duration of the window.

Stop claiming NMIs from within the perf handler. When no counter
overflowed there is nothing to claim, so always report NMI_DONE and let
the remaining NMI sources be probed first. Defer the window check to the
very end of the dispatch path, where it is used only as a last resort.

Introduce perf_nmi_window_active(), which reports whether the latency
window opened by the last PMC overflow on this CPU is still open. It is
called from unknown_nmi_error() only after all NMI_LOCAL handlers, the
reason port and all NMI_UNKNOWN handlers failed to identify the NMI.
Only then is the bogus "unknown NMI" report suppressed. A __weak
fallback in arch/x86/kernel/nmi.c always returns false, so non-AMD
platforms are unaffected.

nmi_stats.unknown is still incremented before the suppression, so the
dropped NMIs remain observable through debugfs.
