I still don't know anything about arm64 or SError, but I see these KVM
commits about using ESB to manage SError in some cases:

  0e5b9c085dce ("KVM: arm64: Consume pending SError as early as possible")
  472fc011ccd3 ("KVM: arm64: nVHE: Don't consume host SErrors with ESB")

I assume it's not possible or practical to use ESB in the native host
case to deal with issues like this in a generic way instead of the
vendor-specific feature Qcom is using here?

OK, I guess this part of handling of UR/CT is device-specific, not
prescribed by the PCIe spec.
