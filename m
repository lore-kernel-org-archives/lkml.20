Looks good to me, thank you for this series Krishna!

With the comment modification I commented to the patch 3, I applied this series
to damon/next [1] tree.  Unless you raise other opinions or Andrew picks this
into mm.git with the comment modification, I will repost the version in my tree
as the next version of this series with the comment modification soon (up to ~1
week later).  If you have a different opinion for the comment modification, it
seems I forgot doing that or you cannot wait for my action, please feel free to
let me know or post the next version on your own.
