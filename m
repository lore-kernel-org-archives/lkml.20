mmc-async-req.rst still documents interfaces that no longer exist:

 - mmc_start_req() was renamed to mmc_start_areq() by commit c3399ef55d8e
  ("mmc: core: rename mmc_start_req() to *areq()") and then removed together
  with the rest of the asynchronous request machinery when the block driver
  switched to blk-mq, by commits 81196976ed94 ("mmc: block: Add blk-mq support")
  and 126b62700386 ("mmc: core: Remove code no longer needed after the switch to blk-mq").

 - mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() was removed by commit 0fbfd1251830
   ("mmc: block: Remove code no longer needed after the switch to blk-mq"),
   and was replaced by mmc_blk_mq_issue_rw_rq().

 - The is_first_req argument of the ->pre_req() callback was dropped by
   commit d3c6aac3bdfe ("mmc: delete is_first_req parameter from pre-request callback"),
   so the "Optimize for the first request" section is obsolete as well.

 - The Linaro wiki page holding the IOZone/mmc_test measurements no longer exists.

Update the document to describe the current request lifecycle: mmc_pre_req(),
mmc_start_request(), mmc_wait_for_req() and mmc_post_req()), and drop the sections
describing the long-gone interfaces and the dead link.

-It starts a new MMC command request for a host. The function isn't

-Optimize for the first request
-==============================

-The first request in a series of requests can't be prepared in parallel

-The argument is_first_req in pre_req() indicates that there is no previous
