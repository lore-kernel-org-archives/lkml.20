Thanks for the review, Alan.  v2 is out and addresses these:

Answers inline.

Right, that is the reason for .BTF.meta: the size is known at build time,
so the file is created with its final size at boot and the load happens
in read()/mmap().  No kernfs internals, no i_size update.

I have now tested exactly that with the in-tree bpftool (libbpf 1.8) as
the first user on a fresh boot, nothing else having touched the BTF:

  bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
  bpftool btf list

Both work and lsmod shows btf_vmlinux afterwards.  Same for libbpf-loaded
programs as the first user: a global subprogram taking the context,
bpf_snprintf_btf(), a CO-RE field read, and a kfunc of an out-of-tree
module (below).

Yes.  If request_module() fails the caller gets NULL, i.e. behaves as on a
kernel without BTF, and the next user retries; nothing is cached.  So a
program that needs kernel types before the root fs is mounted fails
unless btf_vmlinux.ko is in the initramfs.  I have added a paragraph
along the lines you suggest to the Kconfig help in v2.

Right.  With =m v2 strips the BTF from vmlinux, so no boot image carries
it; it only lives in btf_vmlinux.ko, which a system can also choose not
to install.

Not in v1, thanks for asking.  Looking at that case showed a problem,
fixed in v2: for a module with .BTF.base the raw .BTF is only valid
against the distilled base and is rewritten in place when it is
relocated, so it must not be served before that.  In v2 the sysfs file
of such a module is still created at load time with its final size (the
relocation only rewrites ids and string offsets), but its reader loads
the vmlinux BTF and waits until this module's BTF is relocated and
published before serving it; modules without .BTF.base, whose data is
final, are served as before.

Tested with an out-of-tree module that has a .BTF.base and registers a
kfunc from its init, loaded before the vmlinux BTF: once the BTF is
loaded it gets its id, relocated types and its kfunc, and a program
calling that kfunc works.

Agreed, and v2 says so explicitly in the Kconfig help and the cover
letter: the copy kept for a deferred module is the same copy
btf_parse_module() makes with =y, so module BTF costs the same at the same
time in both; the saving is the vmlinux BTF only.

Makes sense as a follow-up; I would rather not grow this series with it.
The distinction you draw (keep it for modules that register kfuncs or
struct_ops, make it optional otherwise) is what I would start from.

Thanks,
Jay
