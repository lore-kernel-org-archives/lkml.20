Yes, it will impact userspace. But quoting you from above:

"is being abused to inform memory mapping attributes and other device/BAR=
=20
level properties that it was never intended for."

What does the userspace then do with the information? Does it qualify=20
under "it was never intended for"?

??? Would that even be spec compliant??

The point is to consider them 64-bit window eligible so yes, kernel would=
=20
definitely be basing decision on that but that's intentional.

So on a more concrete terms, you're referring to the check in=20
proc_bus_pci_mmap()? And the one in __pci_resource_attr_is_visible() +=20
pci_dev_resource_wc_is_visible()? I suppose that wouldn't work then.

So if just setting IORESOURCE_PREFETCH is not workable, how about adding a=
=20
getter for res->flags which adds IORESOURCE_PREFETCH into the returned=20
flags if it's PCIe device and (in the end) use the raw value only in those=
=20
places that actually care about wc distinction. What I don't want to see=20
us adding that pci_is_pcie() everywhere.
