So the name "structured" tag will be replace my "skippable" tag. I don't
want to use "metadata" because we don't know if future tags will be only
metadata tags or something else that shouldn't be qualified by "metadata".

Skippable tag format:
  - bit 31: set to 1
      Indentify a skippable tag.
  - bits 30..24: Data length encoding
      Encode the length of data attached to the tag.
      0b0000000: No data
      0b0000001: 1 32-bit word
      0b0000010: 2 x 32-bits words
      0b0000011: 3 x 32-bits words
      ...
      0b1111101: 125 x 32-bits words
      0b1111110: 126 x 32-bits words
      0b1111111: varlen encoding. The length of data is encode by an 32-bit
                 word available right after the tag. This word gives the
                 length of data in bytes.

  - bits 23..0: Tag identifier

The full tag value are used to identify a tag. Two skippable tags with the
same tag identifier field but with different data lengh encoding should be
considered as two different tags.

The exact tag value is completely known when the new tag is defined and its
data length encoding must not be determine at runtime when the exact length
of data is known.

Any tags where the length of the data is not known when the tag is defined
(i.e. sizeof(data) cannot be determined when the tag is defined) must use the
varlen encoding value (0b1111111). Tags with strings or arrays where the number
of items in the array can vary should use the varlen encoding.

Also for tags where the length of data is greater than 126 x 32-bits words
(maximum value without using varlen encoding), the varlen encoding must be used
even if the length of data is known when the tag is defined.

Tags reserved for tests purpose:
  Any tags with the tag identifier set to 0xffffff are reserved for test
  purpose. When a parser find this kind of tag, it must ignore the tag (skip
  it). A generator must never use this kind of tags, except, of course, if
  the generator is used to generate a dtb for test purpose.


What is you opinion about this description?
Do you agree on the description? If so I will implement it on next iteration.
