Hi Matt,

Thanks for v4, this is great to see. Attributing precise samples to
PMPC is the big win here: it puts the most important part of the
ProfileMe data, the IP, in a generic field, so perf report, annotate,
etc. just work. I have a suggestion about the rest of the data, which
is currently only reachable through PERF_SAMPLE_RAW. Raising it now
since it's easier to shape before the uapi lands.

The I_STAT status and the PCTR1 window count are only really usable
via alpha-profileme.py. IBS was in the same position for years, until
the perf mem/c2c work started filling in the generic sample fields
alongside the raw record (perf_ibs_parse_ld_st_data() [1]). The same
seems worthwhile here: keep the raw record as is for full fidelity,
and set the generic fields where the data maps cleanly.

The PCTR1 window count looks like a natural fit for
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT. It's 20 bits, so it fits var1_dw without
saturating, and var1_dw is what the weight and local_weight sort keys
read. What the weight means is already PMU specific (IBS puts the DC
miss latency there, and tag-to-retire cycles in var2_w), so for
cycles:p it would be the inum retire delay. var3_w, where x86 puts
retire latency, may be closer in meaning, but it's only 16 bits and
its sort keys are enabled per arch in the tool. Something like:

if (sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_TYPE) {
  /* not initialized by perf_sample_data_init() */
  data.weight.full =3D 0;
  data.weight.var1_dw =3D pctr1;
  data.sample_flags |=3D PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_TYPE;
}

As Alpha is little-endian, that's also the right value for plain
PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT, which is what perf record -W asks for unless the
arch opts in to the struct, so it'd work without a tools change. I'd
keep the I_STAT bits out of var2_w/var3_w though, as the tool sums
and averages weights. One wrinkle is the PALmode samples, where the
IP stays as the interrupted PC, so the window count would be charged
to an instruction it doesn't belong to; it may be best to leave the
weight unset for those.

Similarly, if any I_STAT trap types identify a memory event, a DTB
miss on a load or store say, setting PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC (mem_op,
mem_dtlb) for those samples would make them visible to the memory
sort keys. If nothing maps cleanly, I wouldn't force it.

The remaining status bits (retired/killed, mispredict, trap) don't
have a generic home, but they'd make useful filters: format bits,
in config1 say, for retired-only, mispredict-only and trapped-only,
with the driver dropping samples that don't match. Arm SPE's
event_filter does much the same in hardware, with retired and
mispredicted among its bits. Retired-only would also stop killed,
wrong-path instructions showing up as hot spots in a plain perf
report. Since PEBS and IBS op only sample retired instructions, it
may even make sense for precise_ip to imply retired-only, leaving the
profileme bit for the unfiltered view. That one changes what a
default perf record gives on Alpha, so it's worth deciding before
merge rather than after.

All of this is additive to the raw format and alpha-profileme.py, so
it could equally be a follow-up if you'd rather not grow the series.

Thanks,
Ian
