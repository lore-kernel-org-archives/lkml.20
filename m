Hello, Peng.

From the cgroup side, this looks okay to me.

The following is a Claude-generated review.

On Thu, Oct 29, 2026 at 08:31:03AM -0700, Peng Yu wrote:

The grammar of this paragraph could use a pass ("Considering this
scenario: The LVM ..."), and "add a per namespace css" isn't accurate.
The patch associates the namespace with a cgroup rather than adding a
css.

What the change guarantees is only in the changelog below "---" and
could be said here:

- every I/O command except Reservation commands runs from its own work
  item on a per-namespace workqueue, and the file backend's Flush, DSM
  and Write Zeroes and zone management run directly in that work item
- a command whose queue is being deleted is aborted
- the work runs under memalloc_noio
- the effective io css is looked up for each command
- buffered_io is refused

With cgroup_id set, IOPS drops 14-20% (424.4k to 363.4k file, 446.4k to
356.7k bdev) and p99 goes from 330us to 1171us (file) and from 313us to
864us (bdev). The description doesn't say whether any io controller
limit was configured for those runs. Typo: "peformance".

The commands now run on blkcg_wq's normal-priority workers (nice 0)
instead of nvmet_tcp_wq and ib-comp-wq, which are WQ_HIGHPRI (nice -20).
In this setup fio runs on the same 4 CPUs, so the target's I/O now
competes with it at equal priority, which might account for part of the
p99 increase. Should blkcg_wq be WQ_HIGHPRI?

The entry could say that the cgroup must be visible in the cgroup
namespace of the task that enables the namespace (cgroup_get_from_id()
checks this), that I/O goes to the nearest online ancestor's io css if
the cgroup is removed while the namespace is enabled, and that only
direct I/O is charged, with Reservation commands and the admin Write
Protect flush left out.

The reason could be stated more directly: buffered writes are written
back later by the flusher, and writeback attributes them through the
page cache's memcg, not through this association.

nvmet doesn't set a bio ioprio, so bio_set_ioprio() derives it from the
submitter's nice value: best-effort level 0 on a highpri worker, level 4
on a normal one. That matters on devices with an I/O scheduler, and
WQ_HIGHPRI would keep it as before.

With more than WQ_MAX_ACTIVE (2048) CPUs online, wq_clamp_max_active()
prints a warning on every enable. Maybe min_t(int, num_online_cpus(),
WQ_MAX_ACTIVE)?

The name uses only the nsid, which is unique only within a subsystem, so
namespaces in different subsystems get identically named workqueues and
rescuer threads.

The !ns->cgrp test can't be true: only wrapped commands get here, and
ns->cgrp is cleared only after the namespace's references drain.

With io.max, blk-throttle holds throttled bios instead of putting the
submitter to sleep, so this check and the dying-queue check only catch
commands that haven't started. A disable or queue teardown then waits
for the held bios at the io.max rate, with nvmet_config_sem held for
write during a disable. That's inherent to throttling, but maybe worth a
short comment?

This keys on ns->cgrp and nvmet_req_run_work() keys on ns->blkcg_wq.
They agree because both are set and cleared together while no command
exists. Maybe nvmet_req_run_work() could test whether the request itself
was wrapped, e.g. req->execute == nvmet_blkcg_queue_req since nothing
reassigns ->execute after the wrap, or a per-request flag set when
wrapping?

The file backend's Flush, DSM and Write Zeroes and zone management now
count against blkcg_wq's max_active for their whole duration
(vfs_fsync(), vfs_fallocate(), submit_bio_wait() over the zones). With
max_active at the number of CPUs, a few slow flushes can fill it and
hold up the namespace's reads and writes. Without cgroup_id these ran on
nvmet_wq and zbd_wq. Probably fine, but worth noting.

Thanks.
