Ok.  I think my comments suggested at least some small pieces which
can be chipped off, even if there's not some big logical break points.

Hm, the way the path is encoded isn't really what I dislike about it.
Something about the "base-dtb" name suggests an existing base tree,
rather than an output desination to me (particularly since in future
you might want an existing base tree to do recursive factoring).  What
I'd suggest is dropping the short option and renaming the long option
to include "output".

Ah, good point.  *thinks* In fact, this is perfectly safe because
propert and node)names are restricted to characters which all lie
within 7-bit ASCII, so UTF-8 and bytestrings are effectively
equivalent.  Sorry, my mistake (repeatedly).

Ah, right.  Again, I'm not convinced this is a great idea, but if we
wanted it the right way to do it is to have fdt_overlay_apply()=20
(optionally) regenerate __local_fixups__.  It's not really merely
"preserving", since applying the overlay might require that some
external fixups be converted to local fixups.

Hm, fair point.  It probably would be quite a lot of work, for minimal
gain.

I would still suggest a cut down version of this: in the case that all
the overlay changes are within a subtree, have the single fragment be
applied there, rather than at /.  It again won't gain a whole lot in
size, but it's much easier to implement and will make for a more
elegant output.  (Can still be after the first cut patch, though).

Ehh.. not sure it shows a total understanding, but it's probably good
enough to work with for now.
