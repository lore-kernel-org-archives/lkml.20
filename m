Hi Guo,

Boost can be switched on and off at runtime as well, so it is no less 
dynamic than thermal or QoS. And with boost off, 3.9 GHz does not go 
above the cap either, so if that were enough, the changelog case would 
not need fixing; in both cases the highest allowed frequency is never 
reached.

Agreed with Lukasz in this point.

Hi Lukasz,

Thanks for the explanation and the DT example. Real platform data like
this is very helpful for this discussion.

May I know wouldn't it be better to handle this in cpufreq alone,
without changing the EM? The EM change may not help with thermal capping
in general: your DT example has no boost OPPs, and if policy->max is
capped at 1700 MHz, RELATION_HE for max seems to resolve to 1500 MHz, as
1600 and 1700 MHz are dominated by 1800 MHz.

When the target is at or above max, the highest frequency within the
limits is wanted. If it is marked inefficient, the frequency that
dominates it is above max and cannot be selected, so maybe it should
not be skipped. That would cover boost off, scaling_max_freq, thermal
and QoS, while targets below max are not affected.

Something like the below (compile-tested only). (Please  let me know
what you and Rafael and Guo think, or if I have overlooked anything if
you would like)
