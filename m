Per-inode open suppression
========================= [docutils]

> +
> +A filesystem can avoid OPEN and RELEASE requests for individual inodes by
> +negotiating FUSE_PER_INODE_NO_OPEN in INIT and setting FUSE_ATTR_NO_OPEN in
> +``fuse_attr.flags``.  For directories, the flag suppresses OPENDIR and
> +RELEASEDIR instead.  This allows, for example, cached content files to avoid
> +open round trips while control files on the same connection retain their
> +open handlers.  Without the negotiated capability the attribute is ignored.
> +
> +The kernel updates the hint when it accepts attributes in replies such as
> +LOOKUP, GETATTR, SETATTR and READDIRPLUS.  STATX replies do not carry
> +``fuse_attr.flags`` and leave the hint unchanged.  The hint is cached inode
> +state; it is not independently revalidated on every open.  A server changing
> +the hint must arrange for fresh attributes to reach the kernel and tolerate
> +concurrent opens using the previous value.
> +
> +For an open served locally, the file handle is zero, FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE is
> +set, and directories also have FOPEN_CACHE_DIR set.  Subsequent requests
> +identify the object by the node ID and may carry a zero file handle.  The
> +server must support these requests without per-open state.  Whether OPEN was
> +sent is recorded for each handle and is not changed by later attribute
> +updates.  An existing server-opened handle still receives its matching
> +RELEASE if the inode hint subsequently becomes set.
> +
> +Remote flock locking is an exception to RELEASE suppression.  When
> +FUSE_FLOCK_LOCKS is negotiated and a handle has successfully performed a
> +server-side flock operation, its final close sends RELEASE with
> +FUSE_RELEASE_FLOCK_UNLOCK and the lock owner, even if OPEN was suppressed.
> +The server must accept this RELEASE with a zero file handle and no preceding
> +OPEN, and use the node ID and lock owner to remove any remaining flock locks.
> +This also applies after an explicit unlock, since the kernel records whether
> +a flock operation succeeded rather than tracking the server's current locks.
> +
> +When FUSE_ATOMIC_O_TRUNC is negotiated, an open with O_TRUNC still sends
> +OPEN and receives a matching RELEASE, so the server can perform truncation.
> +CREATE also retains its usual open and release semantics.  Connection-wide
> +no-open behavior selected by an ENOSYS response continues to take precedence.

> +The hint does not make an inode immutable, grant permissions, or suppress
