I'm probably one of the few that doesn't know. I didn't think of the whole =

Is this huge as in big or huge pages. For the latter I would put it: ``huge=

or `huge page`-systems.

It's two long sentences, thus (I think) hard to understand. I _rewrote_ it =
this way:

As page-granularity access checking overhead could be significant on huge s=
ystems,
LRU lists are normally not fully nor proactively sorted but rather partiall=
y=20
and reactively sorted for special events.  These events include specific us=
er requests,
system calls and memory pressure.  As a result, LRU lists are sometimes not
suitable to be used as a trustworthy access pattern source. These situation=
s=C2=A0
including reclamation target page selection under sudden memory pressure.

Please note:
  target pages selection
->target page selection

There is 2x (de)prioritization, 6x [de]prioritizations, 2x[in]active and a =
few more in the
file. They are all fine by themself, but not mixed. [] or ()?
