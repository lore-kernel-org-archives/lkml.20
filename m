From: Pengfei Li <lipengfei28@xiaomi.com>

Document stackmap configuration, tracefs interfaces, reset semantics,
binary ABI and implementation trade-offs.

Call out the externally visible details:

- reset clears only the map, so ids already present in the ring buffer
  may become unresolved or resolve to a reused slot
- boot-time deduplication begins when global_trace.stackmap is
  published; the preceding full-stack path still has normal
  ring-buffer reservation failure semantics
- capacity is measured in stack records and concurrent duplicates can
  consume it
- entries counts claimed element records and can include duplicates or
  records not yet published
- stack_map is required while stack_map_stat and stack_map_bin are
  auxiliary
- stack_map_bin uses native byte order and version 1
- open-time bitmap membership yields exactly nr_stacks records but is
  not a payload snapshot, so ref_count can change
- reset is detected at the next seq pass after buffered bytes drain and
  reports -ESTALE; a completed old export still ends with normal EOF

- CONFIG_FTRACE_STACKMAP allocates the map at tracefs initialization even
  when the runtime option remains disabled; the default element pool is
  about 8 MiB and the maximum is about 130-135 MiB
- stack_map_bin exposes raw adjusted kernel IPs without kptr_restrict
  sanitization; mode 0440 plus tracing_check_open_get_tr() and
  LOCKDOWN_TRACEFS form its access boundary
- reset keeps the fixed 4-byte, non-generation-tagged stack-id ABI, so an
  old id can resolve to a reused slot

Also describe the address-adjustment and offline-symbolization limits,
including KASLR and module addresses.

+======================
+Ftrace Stack Map
+======================
+
+:Author: Pengfei Li <lipengfei28@xiaomi.com>
+
+Overview
+========
+
+The ftrace stack map provides stack trace deduplication for the ftrace
+ring buffer. When enabled, instead of storing full kernel stack traces
+(typically 80-160 bytes each) in the ring buffer for every event, ftrace
+stores only a 4-byte ``stack_id``. The full stacks are maintained in a
+separate hash table and exported via tracefs for userspace to resolve.
+
+This is inspired by eBPF's ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE`` but integrated
+into ftrace's infrastructure, requiring no userspace daemon.
+
+Configuration
+=============
+
+Enable ``CONFIG_FTRACE_STACKMAP=y`` in the kernel config.
+
+Kernel command line parameters:
+
+- ``ftrace_stackmap.bits=N`` - Set map capacity to 2^N stack records
+  (default: 14 → 16384 records; valid range: 10-18). Concurrent duplicate
+  entries can consume this capacity.
+
+  At ``bits=18`` the kernel reserves roughly 130 MB of vmalloc memory
+  for the element pool. The cap is set intentionally to bound memory
+  usage.
+
+The map is allocated when tracefs initializes after
+``CONFIG_FTRACE_STACKMAP=y`` has been built in and the required resolver node
+can be created. This allocation happens even if the runtime ``stackmap`` option
+remains disabled. On a 64-bit kernel, the element pool consumes roughly 8 MiB
+at the default ``bits=14`` and 130-135 MiB at ``bits=18``; the hash table and
+small per-CPU metadata are additional allocations.
+
+Usage
+=====
+
+Enable stack deduplication::
+
+    echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/options/stackmap
+    echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/options/stacktrace
+    echo function > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
+
+The trace output will show ``<stack_id N>`` instead of full stack traces::
+
+    sh-1234 [006] d.h.. 123.456789: <stack_id 42>
+
+To view the actual stacks::
+
+    cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_map
+
+Output format::
+
+    stack_id 42 [ref 1337, depth 8]
+      [0] schedule+0x48/0xc0
+      [1] schedule_timeout+0x1c/0x30
+      ...
+
+To view statistics::
+
+    cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_map_stat
+
+Output::
+
+    entries:      2500 / 16384
+    table_size:   32768
+    successes:    148923
+    drops:        0
+    success_rate: 100%
+
+To reset the stack map::
+
+    echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_map
+
+Reset returns ``-EBUSY`` only if another reset is already in progress.
+
+Reset clears the map and nothing else: the trace buffer is left
+untouched and tracing does not have to be stopped. As a result a trace
+can still contain ``<stack_id N>`` records after a reset. Such an id
+either has no entry in ``stack_map``, or -- once tracing continues and
+the slot is reused -- resolves to an unrelated stack. The 4-byte IDs are not
+generation-tagged, so a consumer cannot distinguish that reuse from the ID
+alone. That is misleading output, not corruption. If you need the ids in an
+existing trace to stay meaningful, read the trace out before resetting.
+
+Boot-time activation
+====================
+
+The stackmap option can be enabled from the kernel command line::
+
+    trace_options=stackmap,stacktrace
+
+The regular full-stack fallback remains in use until the map is successfully
+created, the required ``stack_map`` resolver exists, and the map is published
+to ``global_trace.stackmap``. Deduplication starts at that publication
+boundary. While the map is unpublished, the fallback makes the usual
+ring-buffer reservation, which can still fail under the existing ring-buffer
+semantics. Early-boot stacks recorded before publication are not deduplicated.
+
+Tracefs Nodes
+=============
+
+``stack_map`` is the required resolver and reset node. The
+``stack_map_stat`` and ``stack_map_bin`` files are auxiliary observability nodes.
+If tracefs cannot create either auxiliary node, it emits a warning but does
+not disable stackmap; ``stack_map`` remains available to resolve and reset the
+map. The absence of an auxiliary node therefore does not disable stackmap.
+
+The files are owned by root and not world-readable (``stack_map``: 0640;
+``stack_map_stat`` and ``stack_map_bin``: 0440).
+
+``stack_map``, ``stack_map_stat`` and ``stack_map_bin`` all use
+``tracing_check_open_get_tr()`` in ``open()``. It rejects access under
+``LOCKDOWN_TRACEFS`` or when the tracing subsystem is globally disabled
+(``tracing_disabled``), and pins the owning trace array until release. The
+check applies at open time, so raising lockdown after tracefs has been
+populated still blocks later opens, including the ``stack_map`` reset write.
+
+``stack_map_bin`` is additionally a raw tracing ABI: its payload contains
+raw kernel instruction pointers after ``trace_adjust_address()`` and
+does not apply ``kptr_restrict`` sanitization. VFS permissions restrict
+the file to mode 0440.
+This follows the existing trust boundary for raw tracing interfaces such as
+``trace_pipe_raw`` and ``available_filter_functions_addrs``.
+
+``stack_map``
+    Text export of all deduplicated stacks with symbol resolution.
+    Writing ``0`` or ``reset`` clears all entries.
+
+``stack_map_stat``
+    ``entries`` is the number of element records claimed since the last reset.
+    Other statistics are table_size, successes (map operations that returned a
+    stack ID), drops (map capacity or probe-limit failures), and success_rate.
+    Entries is not a strict count of unique stacks: it can include duplicate
+    records created by concurrent insertions and records claimed but not yet
+    published in the hash table.
+    The success_rate is ``successes / (successes + drops)``; it does not include
+    bypasses that never call the map, such as deep stacks, reset windows, or ring
+    buffer reservation failures. The field is always present and reports
+    0% when no success or drop has occurred. Drops accumulate when the
+    element pool is exhausted; once that happens, slots that won the
+    cmpxchg but failed to allocate an element remain "claimed but empty"
+    and increase probe pressure for any future insert hashing to the same
+    bucket. Reset clears these gravestones.
+
+``stack_map_bin``
+    Binary export for efficient userspace consumption. Format:
+
+    - Header (16 bytes): magic(u32) + version(u32) + nr_stacks(u32) + reserved(u32)
+    - Per stack: stack_id(u32) + nr(u32) + ref_count(u32) + reserved(u32) + ips(u64 × nr)
+
+    All fields are written in the kernel's native byte order.
+    Userspace tools detect endianness by reading the magic value.
+    Magic: ``0x46534D42`` ('FSMB'), Version: 1.
+
+    Trampoline frames are exported as the sentinel value
+    ``0x7fffffff`` (FTRACE_TRAMPOLINE_MARKER); all other addresses are
+    passed through ``trace_adjust_address()`` so they match the
+    ``stack_map`` text output's address-adjustment rules. Note this is
+    the same adjustment ftrace applies to its own trace output (mainly
+    relevant for persistent / last-boot buffers), not a general KASLR
+    un-offset. The dump tool's ``--vmlinux`` mode is therefore valid only
+    when core-kernel addresses already match that vmlinux, for example
+    with ``nokaslr``. It does not resolve KASLR-slid or module addresses.
+
+    The table is streamed rather than copied into a private payload
+    buffer. At ``open()``, the kernel records the currently populated
+    slot numbers in a bitmap and sets ``nr_stacks`` to that exact count.
+    The bitmap is at most 64 KiB at the largest supported table size;
+    stack payloads remain in the map and are emitted through
+    ``seq_file``. Entries inserted after ``open()`` are not part of that
+    fd's record set, so exactly ``nr_stacks`` records follow the header.
+
+    Because the reader lock is released between ``read()`` calls, a
+    reset can land part-way through reading the file. That would
+    otherwise splice two generations of the map into one stream, which a
+    binary consumer could not detect, so the export tracks a generation
+    counter. After any data already buffered by the current ``seq_file``
+    pass has been consumed, the next pass that needs to resume iteration
+    detects a reset and fails with ``-ESTALE``. It never appends records
+    from the new generation. ``ESTALE`` is used instead of ``EAGAIN``
+    because ``seq_file`` treats ``EAGAIN`` as an internal retry during
+    seeks. Reopen the file and read it again.
+
+    A reader that has already reached the end of the export is not
+    affected: the final ``read()`` returns 0 as usual even if a reset
+    happened, because no data remains that could come from a different
+    generation.
+
+The text export has no generation check. It serializes each ``seq_file``
+pass against reset through the same rwsem, but a ``stack_map`` reader that
+spans a reset can still produce text from two generations across separate
+``read()`` calls, and nothing reports that. Symbolized text is meant to be
+read rather than parsed as a record stream, so this is deliberate. A
+consumer that needs a consistent snapshot should either read ``stack_map``
+completely within a window where no reset happens, or use
+``stack_map_bin``, which does detect the change.
+
+Design
+======
+
+The stack map is modeled after ``tracing_map.c`` (used by hist triggers),
+using a lock-free design based on Dr. Cliff Click's non-blocking hash table
+algorithm:
+
+- **Lookup/Insert**: Lock-free via ``cmpxchg``, safe in NMI/IRQ/any context
+- **Memory**: Pre-allocated element pool, zero allocation on the hot path
+  (no GFP_ATOMIC failures under memory pressure)
+- **Collision**: Linear probing with a 2x over-provisioned table; probe
+  length is bounded so worst-case insert/lookup is O(1)
+- **Scope**: Currently supports the global trace instance
+- **Hash**: 32-bit jhash with a per-instance random seed; full ``memcmp``
+  confirms matches
+
+Deduplication is best-effort, not strict: if two CPUs race in the
+insert path with the same ``key_hash`` (i.e. the same stack), the
+``cmpxchg`` loser advances by one slot and may insert the same stack
+again. Under heavy contention this can produce a small number of
+duplicate entries for the same stack; ``ref_count`` is then split
+across the duplicates. Total memory is still bounded by the element
+pool size, and lookup correctness is unaffected (each duplicate is
+a self-consistent entry with its own ``stack_id``). The trade-off is
+intentional and keeps the hot path lock-free.
+
+Performance
+===========
+
+Typical results on an aarch64 SMP system (function tracer, 2 seconds):
+
+- Stack records: ~3000
+- Dedup rate: 84-98% (depends on workload diversity)
+- Ring buffer savings: ~80% for stack data
+- Overhead per event: ~50ns (one jhash + hash table lookup)
