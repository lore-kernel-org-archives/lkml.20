I don't _think_ it does that. It does behave a bit differently for MFP,
but that's wrt. management frames.

Fundamentally, in this case the driver (even mac80211) shouldn't install
(data) keys to hardware.

I'd need to sit down and (re-)derive that, but I don't recall it being
particularly tricky - just boils down to the various dependencies
between features.

Presumably that would mean IGTK/BIGTK can be offloaded and remain
working, but TK/GTK can't be known to the firmware since it's not FIPS
certified.

I mean, you _could_ push this further and keep almost all features: you
still give PTK/GTK to firmware but don't use the offload mechanisms for
data frames; though presumably then you'd not consider the result "good
enough" since then a non-certified component (the firmware/hardware)
holds the keys...?

I have no opinion on that, I guess the crypto folks should chime in
about that. Having something very obvious makes sense to me, vs. having
it at wifi or even driver level.
