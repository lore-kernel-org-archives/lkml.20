If the l3 resource has controls as chosen by mpam_resctrl_pick_cache/mba() then that control class
is used. Otherwise, it's just the class for the event in the first call of by
mpam_resctrl_monitor_init() which is is the lowest eventid as it's in the iteration in
mpam_resctrl_setup(). If there are two events they must be QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID and
QOS_L3_MBM_LOCAL_EVENT_ID and so by the order of iteration it's QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID.

Yes... Some parts of the driver are overly flexible and so overly complicated. I hope to find some
time to make this cleaner.

Ah, I see what you are getting at. As the monitor components are only considered when there topology
matches the l3 cache (same cpu affinity for each instance) then the find_component() call will never
fail and so mon_comp can't be NULL at this point.

Monitor component CPU affinity is enforced by topology_matches_l3() to be the same as the L3.
Additionally, traffic_matches_l3() adds extra conditions that mean that there can be considered an
uninterrupted link between l3 and memory and so an MSC at either end is effectively the same. Namely
the same restrictions I've mentioned before, only a single l3 cache, a single NUMA node and no
intermediate caches.

You list two rather than three here? Possibly you are also thinking the MSC cpu affinity which can
be different from that of the components as it indicates which cpus the MSC is reliably accessible
from. This may be a larger set of cpus than those affine to the component it controls, e.g. every
CPU if the MSC is always on and it's register interface can be reached by all the cpus.

I don't think co-author is necessary as I've just offered review and you mentioned you'd already
tried out the new structures. Up to you though.

Thanks for helping with MPAM,
