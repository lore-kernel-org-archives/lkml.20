> bpf: Recover the low 32 bits on the reverse link direction

TL;DR:
- New sync_linked_regs() arm may intersect contradictory 32-bit ranges to
  empty, triggering verifier bug WARN or -EFAULT on valid programs; no prev
  restore
- Comment on width split is inaccurate (nit)

Can the cnum32_intersect_with(&reg->r32, low.r32) above produce an empty
range here?

The differencing arm further down in sync_linked_regs() saves prev and
guards against exactly that:

    struct bpf_reg_state prev = *reg;
    ...
    if (range_bounds_violation(reg))
            *reg = prev;
    reg_bounds_sync(reg);

Its comment explains that an empty intersection means the two sides
contradict, that reg_bounds_sync() refuses to touch an empty range, and that
the first later reg_bounds_sanity_check() would report it as a verifier bug.
The new arm has no such fallback, so reg_bounds_sync() returns early on the
empty r32, and tnum_intersect() of two contradicting constants gives an
arbitrary const subreg.

A contradiction looks reachable because the wide base can know more about
its low half than a ZEXT/SEXT member does.  FULL against ZEXT/SEXT and ZEXT
against SEXT pairs are skipped by the link_kind check:

    if (reg->link_kind && known_reg->link_kind &&
        reg->link_kind != known_reg->link_kind)
            continue;

but the base learns from every member: from a FULL one through the
differencing arm, and now from a ZEXT or SEXT one through this arm.  For
example (cpuv4, no CAP_BPF delta needed):

    call bpf_get_prandom_u32
    r6 = r0              /* wide, id N */
    w7 = w6              /* r7 ZEXT d0 */
    r8 = (s32)r6         /* r8 SEXT d0 */
    if w7 != 5 goto 1f   /* new arm: r6.r32 = {5}; r8 skipped (SEXT/ZEXT) */
    if w8 != 6 goto 1f   /* r8 low half unknown -> both paths explored */
    r0 = r6              /* fallthrough: new arm r6.r32 = {5} & {6} = EMPTY */
  1: r0 = 0; exit

On the fallthrough of "if w8 != 6", r8.r32 is {6}.  r6 is still wide, since
after the first sync its r64 is [5, 0xffffffff00000005] and get_reg_width()
returns 64.  cnum32_intersect({5,0},{6,0}) returns CNUM32_EMPTY.  The
"r0 = r6" mov then reaches reg_bounds_sanity_check(env, ..., "alu") at the
end of check_alu_op() with "range bounds violation", and verifier_bug()
fires BPF_WARN_ONCE.  That is a real WARN_ONCE under CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL (and
a panic with panic_on_warn), and it logs "verifier bug: REG INVARIANTS
VIOLATION".  With BPF_F_TEST_REG_INVARIANTS, which test_loader sets by
default, the load fails with -EFAULT.

The same thing happens with a FULL member in place of the SEXT one
(r8 = r6; r8 += 3; if w8 != 8 ...; if w7 != 6 ...), where both r6 and r8
end up with an empty r32.  Before this patch the guard simply did continue
for these pairs, so the program verified cleanly.

This is the case zext_contradiction_keeps_range_sane was written to pin for
the differencing arm.  Would saving prev = *reg before the intersection and
restoring it on range_bounds_violation(), as the differencing arm does, work
here?

No later commit in bbd86cb1eea3..73fbac05c8bd touches sync_linked_regs().
The following narrowing fill and spill patches (48dc0496cddb "bpf: Track
low-32 scalar equality across narrowing stack fills" and 3649346488fc "bpf:
Track low-32 scalar equality across narrowing stack spills") only add more
ZEXT/SEXT links that can reach this arm.

This comment says that when BPF_REG_LINK_FULL meets a 32-bit kind, a wide
member has already been handled by the arm above and only a member that fits
32 bits is skipped.  Is that split by member width accurate?

The arm above only runs when known_reg is the ZEXT/SEXT side and reg is the
NONE/FULL side.  In the other direction, known_reg FULL and reg SEXT, the
pair always reaches this continue, and a SEXT member can be wide in the
get_reg_width() sense, since negative (s32) values give a umax up to
U64_MAX.

sext_no_sync_when_base_has_delta is exactly this case: r8 = r6 + 3 is FULL,
r7 = (s32)r6 is SEXT, and "if r8 != 3" narrows nothing in r7.  The code
splits by which side is narrow (direction), not by member width.

Could the comment describe it by direction instead, i.e. only a narrow
known_reg reaches the arm above, and a FULL known_reg is skipped against any
32-bit member?
