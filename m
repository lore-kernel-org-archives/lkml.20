Hi Hermes,

I accidentally started reviewing the first version, then noticed there were
more. Could you address my comments in follow-up patches, please?

Why is the default to enable printing all debug information? Shouldn't this

You have a single sub-device. Why not to use the sub-device state lock for
this? This driver should also fully switch to sub-device state (related
comments below).

You won't be switching PHYs at runtime, will you? You should have two
arrays in this case, selected based on PHY type.

Either align the latter line to start after the opening parenthesis or wrap

It'd be nicer to define a struct for this actually.

Please don't add this, the driver should assume the configuration *is*
available in DT. Also the NULL check is redundant;
v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_alloc_parse() does it.

Either combine the error checks or add a label for error handling, use goto

I wonder if it'd be cleaner to have this in probe -- error handling becomes
difficult with these intermediate initialisation helpers that do apprently
unrelated things.

You'll need to call v4l2_subdev_init_finalize()  here to fully initialise
the sub-device state.

Similarly, call v4l2_subdev_cleanup() on error path after finalize() as
well as in remove.
