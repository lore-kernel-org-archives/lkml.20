Can this loop iteration count be bounded? The critical section covers
the whole free_by_rcu_ttrace -> waiting_for_gp_ttrace transfer, so
c->lock is held with IRQs disabled for a number of iterations that has
no upper bound.

free_by_rcu_ttrace is filled from enque_to_free() by free_bulk() and,
more significantly, by the batch append in __free_by_rcu():

kernel/bpf/memalloc.c:__free_by_rcu() {
    llist_add_batch(llnode, c->waiting_for_gp_tail,
                    &tgt->free_by_rcu_ttrace);
}

That batch is the whole c->waiting_for_gp chain, which builds from
every bpf_mem_free_rcu()/unit_free_rcu() that happened while
call_rcu_in_progress was set, proportional to the object-free rate
without any watermark. While call_rcu_ttrace_in_progress is set,
successive __free_by_rcu() invocations keep appending without anything
draining it, so batches accumulate across rounds.

Compare the other new critical sections in the patch, which are all
O(1): __llist_del_all in __free_rcu and drain_mem_cache, or bounded by
c->batch in alloc_bulk (roughly 48 iterations max). Only this one is
unbounded, and raw_spinlock_t + irqsave means it is non-preemptible
even on PREEMPT_RT, where do_call_rcu_ttrace() is reached from the
rcuc/rcuop kthread via __free_by_rcu().

The lock is only needed for the destination list. llist_del_all() on
free_by_rcu_ttrace is an xchg and is already safe against concurrent
llist_add() producers without a lock. Could the chain be re-linked (or
its tail found) outside the lock and spliced into waiting_for_gp_ttrace
with a single __llist_add_batch() under the lock, keeping the IRQ-off
window O(1)?

Does the comment above need updating? It says "Except for
waiting_for_gp_ttrace list, there are no concurrent operations on these
lists, so it is safe to use __llist_del_all()."

Before the patch the comment matched the code: waiting_for_gp_ttrace
was the one list drained with the atomic llist_del_all(), and the
comment named it as the exception to "safe to use __llist_del_all()".

After the patch waiting_for_gp_ttrace is the list that does use
__llist_del_all() (now serialised by c->lock), while free_by_rcu_ttrace
and waiting_for_gp still use the atomic llist_del_all(). The sentence
now points at the opposite list from the code, and no longer explains
why the new lock is needed here.

A reader trying to work out which lists still need atomic accessors
after this change gets the wrong answer from the comment. Should the
comment say that concurrent consumption of waiting_for_gp_ttrace is now
excluded by c->lock, so plain __llist_del_all() is safe, while
free_by_rcu_ttrace / waiting_for_gp still need the atomic variants?

Is the statement "Thus, the callback __free_rcu cannot run concurrently"
accurate as written?

Looking at the race diagram three paragraphs later, it shows exactly
that scenario: __free_rcu on CPU1 executing in the middle of
alloc_bulk's llist_del_first on CPU0. What the RCU argument actually
establishes is narrower: the GP cannot complete during the particular
read-side CS it is waiting on, so RCU read-side protection is not what
is missing.

Nothing prevents a new alloc_bulk() from starting after the GP has
completed and running concurrently with the callback. __free_rcu runs
from the rcu_tasks_trace kthread (process context, no irqs disabled, any
CPU) while alloc_bulk runs from irq_work on the cache's own CPU; on
PREEMPT_RT alloc_bulk is even preemptible, so same-CPU interleaving is
possible too.

A reviewer reading this sentence literally would conclude the race in
the diagram is impossible. Could the paragraph say "RCU read-side
protection is not what is missing; what is missing is mutual exclusion
between the two llist consumers"?

Is this premise correct? free_by_rcu_ttrace has two distinct consumers,
and they are not confined to one CPU:

  - alloc_bulk() memalloc.c:225 (still outside c->lock):

    obj = llist_del_first(&c->free_by_rcu_ttrace);

  - do_call_rcu_ttrace() memalloc.c:322, and drain_mem_cache()
    memalloc.c:647:

    llist_del_all(&c->free_by_rcu_ttrace)

do_call_rcu_ttrace() is called as do_call_rcu_ttrace(tgt) with
tgt = c->tgt from free_bulk() (memalloc.c:341, 364) and __free_by_rcu()
(memalloc.c:370, 383). c->tgt is set to the cache that allocated the
object, potentially another CPU's cache:

kernel/bpf/memalloc.c:unit_free() {
    c->tgt = *(struct bpf_mem_cache **)llnode;
}

So llist_del_all(&tgt->free_by_rcu_ttrace) on CPU1 can run concurrently
with llist_del_first(&tgt->free_by_rcu_ttrace) in alloc_bulk(tgt) on
tgt's own CPU. The file's own comment at memalloc.c:220-224 says as
much: "Other CPUs might llist_add() and llist_del_all() in parallel."

What actually keeps that pair harmless in the common case is the RCU
deferral the changelog describes earlier, not single-consumer-ness: the
nodes taken by llist_del_all() are moved to waiting_for_gp_ttrace and
only freed by __free_rcu() after an RCU tasks trace GP, which cannot
elapse while alloc_bulk() is inside its RCU read-side section. That
argument does not cover the two draining paths, which free immediately
while still only being ordered against alloc_bulk() by
WRITE_ONCE(c->draining, true) / irq_work_sync().

Since the changelog is what a reviewer will use to decide the fix is
complete, should the sentence be corrected to state the real reason (RCU
deferral) or should the residual draining-path window be acknowledged?

Leon Hwang suggested in the v2 review that scoped_guard() could be used
instead of explicit raw_spin_lock_irqsave/raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore to
simplify the code and avoid needing the flags variable. This is a code
style improvement that would make the locking more idiomatic. The
suggestion applies to multiple locations: alloc_bulk(), __free_rcu(),
do_call_rcu_ttrace(), and drain_mem_cache(). Is this something worth
addressing before merge?
