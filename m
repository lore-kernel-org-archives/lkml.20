From that perspective, what I am proposing actually goes a step further.  I'm
saying don't commit to supporting *any* specific versions in upstream.  Express
the feature requirements in the serialization payloads, and let userspace sort
out what kernels are compatible based on their actual usage.  The kernel may need
to provide additional discovery mechanisms, e.g. so that userspace can probe to
see what is supported, but discovery is usually fairly simple to implement and
maintain.

No, the subsystem just needs to make sure that it serializes its data using the
defined ABI (where ABI here means the format of the payload and the meaning of
any flags in the header).  That should be *easier* for maintainers to handle than
trying to support arbitrary versions, because it eliminates subjectivity and
having to make judgment calls or remember magic version numbers.

We're in violent agreement on this point, I think we just disagree on how to
express compatibility.

Only because KVM already has a massive ABI surface for save/restore.  If you
want to convince me that magic version numbers are the right approach, then show
me how KVM's existing save/restore support would be made "better" and easier to
maintain by throwing away all of KVM's save/restore uAPI and replacing it with a
versioning scheme.

Have to, or choose to?  I have a very, very hard time believing that it's infeasible
to define a serialization format that is decoupled from kernel internals.

Only if the relevant subsystem defined a poor save/restore ABI in the first place.
