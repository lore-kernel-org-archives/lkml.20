fast_switch() doesn't have to touch min/max_perf, but it did at the moment.

Yeah, understood.  My question is still whether it's practically useful and
we're complicating this.

Two reasons.

1. Platform should be able to handle min_perf being trasiently larger than
max_perf, otherwise it would be fragile.

2. It depends on the reset values of the two registers.

I went over the ACPI Spec and didn't manage to find a descprition on what
the default/reset values of min/max perf registers should be.

For a sensisble design, min_perf defaults to be 0 or lowest perf, and
max_perf defaults to be all 1s or highest perf.  In those cases, we are
safe to directly restore the saved values.
