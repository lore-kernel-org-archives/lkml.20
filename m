Agreed that not meeting the long-idle condition does not necessarily
mean that the CPU was busy. The condition is based on accumulated idle
time, so it is not a reliable indication of whether that CPU should
prevent deferred downscaling.

Thanks for the suggestion. I agree that the load actually measured over
the current sample should be kept separate from the load that may inherit
prev_load. However, I don't think up_threshold is the appropriate
boundary for deciding whether deferred down steps should be applied.

For example, suppose CPU A has been idle for several sampling periods
while CPU B has a sustained load of 75%, with up_threshold at 80 and
down_threshold at 20. The policy is then in conservative's hold region,
so the load itself would trigger neither an increase nor a decrease.
If deferred downscaling is gated only by up_threshold, CPU B would
not block it, so CPU A's deferred idle periods could still reduce
the policy frequency.

I think deferred down steps should instead be applied only when the
maximum load actually measured across the policy is below
down_threshold. To keep this independent of the load returned by
dbs_update(), which may inherit prev_load, we could record the maximum
measured load separately in struct policy_dbs_info, for example as
max_sample_load.

The conservative governor could then gate the deferred reductions with
something like:

    if (policy_dbs->max_sample_load < cs_tuners->down_threshold &&
        policy_dbs->idle_periods < UINT_MAX) {
        ...
    }

This preserves deferred downscaling when the measured policy load is
below down_threshold, while avoiding deferred reductions when any CPU
is in either the hold or upscale region.

I'll rework the patch along these lines, keeping the measured load
separate from the inherited load and using down_threshold for the
deferred-downscale condition. 

I'll send a v2, with a Suggested-by tag for your suggestion.
