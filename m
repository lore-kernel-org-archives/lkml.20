Err, *derp*, what a stupid suggestion of mine.

I don't think that works for the reason I just wrote in my email to Amir:
it would make lookup dependent on the dentry cache. If it's in-cache, you get
your dir, otherwise suddenly -EINVAL.

We can just implement atomic_open() for kernfs/tracefs, do a lookup there,
and if negative with O_CREAT return maybe -ENOENT (or really we need a new
error that says "the requested create could not be serviced," like -ENOCREATE,
or whatever). And if it is positive we do finish_no_open().

It's a bit of a hack because it does not really have anything to do with
atomicity, but it does short-circuit the mkdir call in lookup_open(). I guess
that would work. Maybe I am confused, but wasn't that what you proposed here
earlier?

Best,
Jori.
