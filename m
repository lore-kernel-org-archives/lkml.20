This is another instance where one of your mails around how to organize
process ends up reading like you're lecturing your peers. This is not
just my impression btw. That impression is shared by other subsystem
maintainers - including in your own.

This is a simple case where something got picked up that you didn't want
to have picked up yet. Plus, I haven't gotten around to reading this
yet. VFS isn't exactly a dormant subsystem.

The easy way is to just say "Hey, I don't think this is ready yet. Could
you please drop it. I also would like to quickly sync on how we want to
merge this.".

If another subsystems hooks into the vfs layer or filesystems that the
vfs trees maintain then the default will always be that the vfs layer
provides the shared tree to pull.
