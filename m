Thanks, I=E2=80=99ll take a look then.  I should=E2=80=99ve said this is =
cdev-centric=20
(an explicit open O_RDONLY), as VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD always
generates the fd with RDWR perms.  The path from container/group open
through to device fd generation and then export is similarly=20
semantically weird, but maybe less clear on effort vs benefit to fix.

So, for cdev open it looks like some plumbing, and that it won=E2=80=99t=20=

conflict with this series, so I can look at that separately.

Interesting, thanks.  Reading.

OK, cheers.

(Maybe a couple of these bullets are ~rhetorical, just to get a =E2=80=9Ck=
nown
wrinkle=E2=80=9D searchable somewhere.)

I think this is a change in behaviour re LSM rule, should anyone have
applied any to VFIO in any fine-grained way, so just flagging that.

I=E2=80=99ll send v8 shortly, resolving Christian=E2=80=99s request.  As =
ever, thanks
for the input!
