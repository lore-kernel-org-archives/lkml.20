They are, it is tilcdc. Understood, I will drop the fbdev side, which
also settles your comment on patch 1.

Agreed. I have been following Francesco's series since Sam pointed me
at it, and it is where the DRM follow-up I mentioned in the cover letter
belongs, rather than in a client of my own.

A device tree source fits next to the BGRT one. The BGRT is the firmware
handing the kernel an image and where to put it, and a DT system has no
such table. The BMP loaded as firmware only helps if the file is built
into the kernel, or if a filesystem is already there when the display
comes up. With U-Boot's Falcon mode, the device tree is the only thing
that reaches the kernel.

So the plan would be a node under /chosen carrying a BMP, either in the
node itself or in a reserved memory region the bootloader loaded it
into, with the placement properties from this series. The region is the
same memremap() the BGRT source already does, only with the address
coming from the device tree.

Rotation too: the client skips a BGRT image with the orientation bits
set today, and it could turn it instead. I will ask Rob separately how
he wants the image described, since that is what the binding hinges on.

Francesco, is a v4 on the way? Would you take a DT source as patches on
top of your series, or would you rather I wait until it lands?

Max
