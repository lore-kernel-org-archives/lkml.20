Sorry for the delayed reply.

Unfortunately, I can't confirm whether this scenario is impossible.
I don't currently have an environment where I can reproduce this system
suspend/resume case either.

I agree that if a device can later be detached after its system resume callback
has failed, this may affect other drivers using the same pattern as well,
and determining that seems to require a deeper look into the PM core behavior.

So I don't have a definitive answer here either, and can only point out this
as a potential issue for now.

Thank you,
