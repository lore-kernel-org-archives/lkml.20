How long, and when should the inactivity timer start. (The latter more
than the former, really.)

Right, I don't think anybody is asking for this right now. We're just
trying to clean up the corners on how the existing timer works.

But to be clear, that's not actually how runtime PM works today. It only
works this way for the very small handful of drivers where the parent
calls pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() in .runtime_idle(). I think several
people have acknolwedged that this is a bit of a hack, or at least a
missing feature in runtime PM, and probably should be extended more
widely.

"Expected time before a child may have to resume": isn't that child
last_busy + child delay? So that expected time is already in the past by
the time the child autosuspends.

But:

Yes, I agree it's simple. Maybe the distinction I'm making doesn't
matter that much.

My point here was that I think Rafael was overly concerned about
precisely tuning parent autosuspend delays at the same time as changing
the runtime PM core behavior. Yes, they clearly can be tuned in user
space; but he was suggesting a phase-in / opt-in approach to this
change, because it might harm system power if it's not re-tuned.

The overhead isn't my concern. The mental overhead is. There are several
rough edges that would be smoother without it, IMO.

Ah, but that's not actually true! pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() skips
.runtime_idle(). It (semi)directly calls rpm_suspend().

I appreciate all the responses. One particular part I did have questions
on, which I'll mostly copy/paste:

[Rafael:]
> Now, let me acknowledge that some drivers evidently want rpm_idle() to
> always set the autosuspend timer instead of suspending the device

Do we have any idea what the "other reasons" could be? For example,
because driver writers found it too difficult to find all the
appropriate places to call pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()? (Does commit
b3db492e8335 ("PM: runtime: Mark last busy stamp in
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()") help? Or should pm_runtime_put() behave
similarly?)

I see that USB is one of the subsystems where .runtime_idle() calls
pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(), and I thought you (Alan) might have some
more background on that.

Thanks,
Brian
