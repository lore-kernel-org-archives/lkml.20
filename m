Can you please also set apart how it is conceptually different to
Landlock?

Landlock can see paths (unlike Seccomp), and Landlock policies
(rulesets) are defined and enforced by unprivileged processes through
its userspace API.  It is already a popular choice for AI agent
sandboxing and orchestration frameworks.

What is missing in Landlock which does not make it usable for your use
case?

(Obviously, there are missing features that people would want in
Landlock, but that's an argument that doesn't count IMHO, since it's
still easier to add these features to Landlock than to create a new
separate LSM.)

It's unclear to me why procfs is not covered with "file", since you
are already doing path-based matching.  What operations are restricted
by "descriptor" is also unclear to me.

FWIW since pathname Unix Domain Socket are also addressed by path, we
found it useful to express the rules about them with paths as well, in
Landlock.

In networking and IPC, I am a bit missing how that would work when
*offering* a service (listen(), bind()).  Do you have thoughts on
that?

What is `sysv:flag=N`?  You might be interested in the discussion we
had at [1] -- I found System V IPC tricky to restrict, because many of
its integer identifiers are not FD-like handles, but just live fully
accessible to the entire IPC namespace.

You are creating policies through the file system, but you are at the
same time restricting access to the file system with these policies.
How does that work?

I find both arguments unconvincing.  If it's a BPF program, you can
also audit it in one place - in the BPF program.  And the lobbying to
get CONFIG_BPF_LSM enabled in these kernels is probably not
substantially different than the lobbying to get CONFIG_KAP_LSM
enabled.

I'm surprised that it's privileged, since existing AI agent software
tends to run unprivileged.  Who would be operating this and defining
the policies?  From your description I would have expected that the
"objectives" that inform the policies are roughly equivalent to the
goals that you give to the model in an agent prompt?  Does the agent
software communicate with a privileged agent?  Or does the agent
software spawn off namespaces to attain the necessary privileges?

More of a terminology remark, but when you consider the kernel layer
only, it feels like the compiled predicate snapshot *is* the policy
that you are enforcing?

I don't understand why the JSON format is a question for the kernel
review; you can do the interface in a format that is suitable for the
kernel, and translate from JSON into that format in userspace, not
mixing the layering between that userspace component and kernel space.

I believe we added such hooks for the Landlock namespace and
capability support.

I have to admit, I've read the doc, but still don't understand how
that model is supposed to work.  Do you maybe have a concrete
motivational example which defines such a policy and demonstrates why
that is different and can not implemented with one of the other LSMs
or the BPF-LSM instead?
