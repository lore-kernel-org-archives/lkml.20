Subject: [PATCH] perf jevents: Check the JSON keys that jevents.py never reads
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 2026 19:32:39 +0000

jevents.py reads the fields it wants out of every JSON object by name:
jd.get('BriefDescription'), 'EventCode' in jd, the event_fields table.  A
key spelled differently from the name it looks for is never read, so the
object is built without whatever the field held, and nothing says so.

"BriefDescript6ion" in the three AMD tables (amdzen4/cache.json,
amdzen5/load-store.json, amdzen6/load-store.json) is the case that loses
something: those three events carry no BriefDescription at all, so the
generated table has an empty text field for them.  "PublicDescrition" in
AmpereOneX's mmu.json is the same mistake caught before it cost anything --
the value repeats BriefDescription, and jevents.py drops the long
description when the two are equal, so that table comes out the same either
way.

JsonEvent now remembers which keys of the object it was built from were
never looked at.  `jevents.py --check` reads the tables under <dir> and
reports, for each of those keys that is a near miss for a name jevents.py
reads, the likely spelling and the files carrying it:

  jevents: error: 19 object(s) in 4 file(s) carry a key that looks like a
  misspelling:
    'BriefDescript6ion', did you mean 'BriefDescription'? (3 object(s) in 3
    file(s)):
      x86/amdzen4/cache.json
      x86/amdzen5/load-store.json
      x86/amdzen6/load-store.json
    'PublicDescrition', did you mean 'PublicDescription'? (16 object(s)
    in 1 file(s)):
      arm64/ampere/ampereonex/mmu.json

The architecture and the model are the ones the build takes, and `all` for
both reads every table; the model only picks the tables a build needs, so a
check ignores it.  Naming an architecture reads that directory and the
common and test tables every build reads, and skips the rest.

Keys that are not near misses are left alone. The Intel tables carry
Counter, CountersNumFixed, CountersNumGeneric and Experimental, none of
which jevents.py reads, and Experimental is read by metric.py; a vendor
may add metadata for another reader tomorrow, and an allow list in
jevents.py would mean asking every one of them to edit perf's Python. So
the set of names jevents.py reads is the only list, and a name below the
similarity cutoff is not reported. Over this tree the tables carry 52
distinct key names and jevents.py reads 46 of them; the two misspellings
score 0.97 against the name each was meant to be, and the highest score
among the other unread names is Counter, at 0.78 against CounterMask -- so
any cutoff in that gap reports the same two names, and 0.8 is what this
uses. A key whose words are only reordered ('DescriptionBrief') falls
below it too, and so does a misspelling that lands on another name the
file already reads.

The exit status is 0 when the tree is clean, 1 when something was reported
and 2 when a table could not be read; a bad command line is 2 as well.
make turns either failure into its own status, so a script that has to tell
them apart should run pmu-events/jevents.py directly; for a person it is

  make -C tools/perf jevents-check

which reads the whole tree, and JEVENTS_CHECK_ARCH=x86 reads one
architecture.  That target fails on this tree until the misspellings above
are fixed, which is why they are posted separately and should go in first.

It reads every architecture, not just the one being built: a typo is
cheapest to fix by whoever reads that table next, and that reader may be
building something else.  It is deliberately not part of the build, where a
report about a table the build does not use would fail make for everyone,
and it costs nothing when it does not run, because the tracking is off
unless the check asked for it.  It reads the 973 json files under arch/
that jevents.py parses, and takes seconds of CPU to do it.

It is not a schema: it checks nothing about types, required fields or value
ranges, and it looks at key names only, so a misspelled description in a
value is out of scope.  It also does not read mapfile.csv, which has no
keys, or metricgroups.json, whose keys are group names.

Outside --check this changes two things, both on the failure path.  A table
that does not parse is now reported on stderr as "jevents: error: Exception
processing <path>" and the traceback ends in "Failure processing '<path>'",
where the path used to go to stdout and the traceback came straight from
the pool.  And the output file is now opened after the tables are read, so
a build that fails leaves it as it was instead of truncated to the header.

Written with Hermes Agent, an LLM assistant, which found the misspellings
and wrote this check and its changelog.  I ran the check over the whole
tree, compared the generated tables with those from an unpatched tree on
x86, arm64 and all architectures at once, and ran mypy on jevents.py.
