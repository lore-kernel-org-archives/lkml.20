Thanks for doing this Mike, I wish there had been such a document when I
started using those APIs!

Much of that document feels like an excruciating FIXME list... which is
exactly the state of set_memory/set_direct_map, and better to have it
documented than letting every new user stumble upon the same gotchas.

Overall looks good to me, some minor comments below.

"direct map alias of a struct page" is rather confusing, are we talking
about the mapping of struct page itself?

"do not implement any of them for the direct map" feels ambiguous - I
think what we really mean is that they reject direct map addresses, e.g.
what arm64 does (only accept addresses to kernel VMAs)?

I'm not sure we should even document set_memory_valid(). It doesn't at
all behave like the other set_memory_* on amr64 (no check whatsoever, no
handling of aliases) and is (fortunately) only used from arch code. I've
been meaning to make its name scarier (__set_memory_valid?) for that reason.

That is, set_memory_<perms> propagate those changes.

What does "partially fails" mean?  The splitting may be partial, but no

Same as above, bettermake the subject explicit (set_memory()?).
