Fwiw, here's a follow up on this topic now that I've actually read the
series (or at least, the heart of it in 2/4).

This does exhibit some of the pitfalls of AI generated code.  Most
obviously, that patch itself is pretty monstrous - at least by
default, coding agents aren't very good at considering splitting
series for the benefit of reviewability.  It does exhibit signs of
AI-typical verbosity.  It's not too bad in terms of locally redundant
code, although there are a few examples.  It's worse in terms of
"conceptual verbosity" - most obviously it uses two quite different
ways of representing the tree being processed.  It's not really clear
why or if that's necessary or useful and it makes it substantially
more confusing to read.

I don't know what prompts you used for AI-reviewing-AI, and I don't
have a lot of experience with that, but I wonder if results could be
improved by using some review prompts not focussed on correctness or
(superficial) style.  e.g. "look for DRY violations", "look for
redundantly represented data", "look for workarounds for bugs in
pre-existing code, and fix those sepearately first".
