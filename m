Hi Mete,=20

One assumption in the series should be made explicit, and I think
it answers your question 1.=20

The idea only works if two CPUs that the guest sees as SMT siblings
really run on the same physical core. "An idle sibling of a busy
high-capacity core" is cheaper than a fully idle low-capacity core
only because it uses a physical core the partition already has. That
holds on an LPAR, where hypervisor dispatches whole cores. It does not
hold in general for a guest whose hypervisor schedules vCPUs one at a
time, such as a typical KVM guest with "threads=3D2". There the guest's
sibling masks are just a description, and packing onto "siblings"
gives no benefit.

Nothing in the series checks this, and it is not documented:

- In patch 1, the default arch_needs_idle_smt_prio() returns true,
  and the Kconfig help does not mention that siblings must share a
  physical core. Any arch that selects
  ARCH_SUPPORTS_SCHED_IDLE_SMT_PRIO takes this on without being told.

- In patch 2, the hook checks only the topology mode:

> +bool arch_needs_idle_smt_prio(void)
> +{
> +     if (topology_mode !=3D TOPOLOGY_MODE_HW)
> +             return false;
> +     return true;
> +}

Today s390 seems to be safe because sibling masks are
only built in HW mode.  It is the only place where this
precondition can be enforced.

So I would keep the hook. It is the only place where this
precondition can be enforced. Removing it and tying the feature to
"Kconfig + asymmetric capacities" would drop the check entirely.
Concretely:

1) Document the contract in the Kconfig help and above the hook,
   for example: "Only select this if CPUs reported as SMT siblings
   are always dispatched on the same physical core."

2) Make the s390 hook test the conditions from the cover letter,
   something like:

        return machine_is_lpar() &&
               topology_mode =3D=3D TOPOLOGY_MODE_HW &&
               smp_cpu_mtid;
