I dunno, that seems pretty drastic for some use-cases - the fact that a 
GSI is described in a table doesn't necessarily mean it is critical to 
device operation. If we don't even create the device until all possible 
resources are available, then its driver never has any chance to decide 
whether it's happy to ignore the deferral and just use MSIs or polling 
instead...

Thanks,
Robin.
