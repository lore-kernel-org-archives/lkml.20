Agree. If there are not contexts available for the RMM to use, it
results in RMI_BLOCKED.

The only case where the RMM mandates the execution continues on a "CPU"
(virtual PE rather) is Realm Attestation ABI exposed to the Realm 
(RSI_ATTEST_TOKEN_*).

Btw, SRO contexts are nothing but a "scratch" memory that the RMM uses
to hold the progress made in the SRO. e.g., the donated granules and
what is the next operation expected etc.

The number of PEs is only a factor which can tell the RMM, how many
parallel requests it could get. That said, due to pre-emption there
could be multiple outstanding SRO operations on a single PE. But
also remember that not all SROs require a context from global pool.

Agreed that it would good to probe the number of contexts available.
Or may be even dynamically extend the pool for SRO contexts at
runtime. Will feed this back to the RMM spec, and hopefully we can
address this in the future versions without breaking the existing
ABI.

Thanks
