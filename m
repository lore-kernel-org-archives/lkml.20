I'm not sure what part of this is disagreement?

It's saying passing 0 is a hack, which is one that is still in place and which
this patch makes worse, because instead of explicitly calling out the invalid
value, you're treating it as if it were valid.

Yup, well me of 3 months ago should have suggested what I suggested re: wrapper
(I think you cut that suggestion out of my reply).

Assuming you passed vma->vm_start, not 0? Passing 0 makes it really strange.

I see that in the patch I suggested I didn't update the other callers like I
said you should in the reply, my bad from 3 months ago, but I don't think that
invalidates what's been raised here.

Yep I think that should be squashed into this one, as I say there.

As above.
