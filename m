Subject: [PATCH v4 3/3] perf jevents: Check the JSON keys that jevents.py never reads

jevents.py takes the fields it wants out of each JSON object by name:
jd.get('BriefDescription'), 'EventCode' in jd, and the names in
event_fields. A key spelled another way is dropped without a word, and
the object is built without whatever that field held.

Two of those are in the tree now. "BriefDescript6ion" is in one entry
each of amdzen4/cache.json, amdzen5/load-store.json and amdzen6/load-
store.json, and since those objects carry no other description,
ls_inef_sw_pref.all is generated with an empty text field.
"PublicDescrition" was in 16 of the 28 entries of
arm64/ampere/ampereonex/mmu.json; nothing a user saw changed there,
because each of the 16 also had a BriefDescription with the same text,
which is why the typo could sit there unnoticed.

Add a --check mode that reads every architecture, not just the one being
built: a typo is cheapest to fix by whoever reads that table next, and
that reader may be building something else. It records the keys
JsonEvent was never asked for and reports the ones whose spelling is a
near miss for a name jevents.py does read (difflib ratio 0.8). In this
tree 52 distinct key names occur, jevents.py reads 46 of them, the two
misspellings score 0.97, and the highest score among the remaining
unread names is 0.78 (Counter against CounterMask), so any cutoff in
that gap reports the same two.

It also reports a metric that carries a name but no expression, by
metric name and however the lost MetricExpr key was spelled: the key
report needs the spelling to be close to a name jevents.py reads, and a
metric without its expression cannot be generated at all.

A key that is a near miss for two names at once is reported as well: the
object may carry one of them with the same value, but that does not say
which one the key was meant to be, and the key is one nothing reads
either way.

The tracking is off unless --check asked for it, so a build parses each
object exactly as before and the generated tables are byte-identical
(x86, arm64 and all architectures compared against the same tree without
this patch). The check itself reads the 973 json files under arch/ and
takes seconds of CPU.

Exit status is 0 when nothing was reported, 1 when something was, and 2
when a table could not be read or the command line was wrong; make folds
both failures into its own status, so a script that needs the difference
runs jevents.py directly. Status 0 means the tables under that directory
were read and no unread key looks like a name jevents.py reads. It is
not a promise that a build will succeed: mapfile.csv coverage, the model
that selects a subset of the tables, and the C generation are not part
of it.

It is not a schema either: it checks nothing about types, required
fields or value ranges, and looks at key names only, so a misspelled
description in a value is out of scope. It does not read mapfile.csv,
which has no keys, or metricgroups.json, whose keys are group names.
Names that only metric.py or the C code read are outside it too, so an
"Expermental" key is not reported, and file names and topics are not
keys.

The check runs from the new make target "make -C tools/perf jevents-
check" (JEVENTS_CHECK_ARCH=x86 narrows it to one architecture) and from
perf test, where tests/shell/jevents_check.sh skips with status 2 when
pmu-events/arch is not next to the binary.

The try/except that turns a failed check into status 2 lives in a
function, not at module scope: there the name binds a global, and every
function here that uses `e` as a local then trips pylint's redefined-
outer-name (W0621) in the pylint-pmu-events target.

An empty table list is an error only for a build that named an
architecture. A check still has the parse failures it collected to report,
and arch=none writes the empty tables it always wrote.

Written with Hermes Agent, an LLM assistant, which found the
misspellings and wrote this check, its test and this changelog. I built
perf with it, ran the perf test above, ran the check over the whole
tree, compared the generated tables with those from an unpatched tree on
x86, arm64 and all architectures at once, and ran mypy on jevents.py.

v4: the check's try/except moves into a function, so the name it binds
    is not a module global that makes every local `e` trip pylint's
    redefined-outer-name in the pylint-pmu-events target.  An empty
    table list is an error only for a build that named an architecture:
    --check still reports the failures it collected, and arch=none
    writes the empty tables it wrote before.  Both raised by Sashiko.
v3: metricgroups.json and the string table are read before the output
    files are opened, so a table that does not parse leaves them alone.
