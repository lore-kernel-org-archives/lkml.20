I'm pragmatic and there are different use cases, different constraints,
and different trust models...  Landlock has some good properties which
makes it fit for being used by unprivileged/untrusted processes, and who
can do more can do less.

That's a different problem/challenge, but BPF is gradually being
improved, and I'm sure your contributions would be welcome.

That's kind of the opposite: systemd, as a privileged process, is in
charge of loading BPF programs, but this is not a good example here.
That would make more sense with e.g., a dedicated process that manages a
set of security policies (which might be owned by different teams), pass
these (Landlock) policies to the a privileged process that enrich them
with context, and load the related BPF programs to the kernel.  That's
only one simple example, but it should give a good idea of what is
possible.

Yes, that's a possibility, but a simpler approach would be to just map a
runtime context to a set of security policies (e.g. sandbox all
instances of /usr/bin/foo with a custom profile).
