I don't blame you.

Correct.

It's a swap, yes we won't have two threads with the same tid.

I think we'd just be trading one set of problems for another. In terms
of the kernel side, we have the following set of issues around swapping
the kernel stack instead:

- 'current' itself, this is used throughout the waiting helpers. Things
  like wait_queue_entries that use private = current.

- Any kind of sleeping lock that also stashes away the value of
  'current;.

- signal interrupible sleeps via TASK_KILLABLE

- Just like the userspace side, we have a bunch of kernel side state as
  well in the task_struct. Not a complete list, but:
	- plug, for any kind of in-progress IO submission state
	- journal_info
	- reclaim_state
	- io_uring
	- PF_MEMALLOC and friends
	- task_work
	- lockdep
	- preempt/irq stuff in thread_info

- Kernel stack itself in ways it's tied to the task_struct
	- stack canary
	- KASAN
	- vma tracking
	- thread.sp
	- pt_regs

Probably not a complete list, but it's a start... I do agree that the
kernel stack swap seems like the more immediate idea, but I think it's a
harder problem.

Right, and it's actually pretty related to what we're discussing above.
The first one was Zach's fibrils which attempted the kernel stack swap,
and then we had threadlets from Ingo which went the route that this
patch set is also taking and dealt with userspace state swaps instead.

Well like you that state has long since been swapped out on my end, my
recollection was disagreement on the API, not the swapping itself. But
also extremely hazy there...

Let me know if you find something interesting there.
