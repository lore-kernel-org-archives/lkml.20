 I read through the old pages and found them reasonable.  No, I didn't 
reach for the wiki, perhaps I should have.

 Fair enough, I take your word, this was just a question.  I guess it 
wouldn't hurt having your effort mentioned in the commit description; 
indeed I think it would help saying that the wiki has made all the old 
references obsolete.

 And I get nervous whenever pointers to old information get removed, as it 
makes it gradually more and more difficult to chase.  As recently as the 
day before yesterday I have pointed someone to an archive.org copy of a 
specification they were after and could not find for an old piece of MIPS 
hardware, that no contemporary search engine would list and I could only 
locate because 20+ years ago I recorded the full URL as I downloaded it.
