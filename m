The driver keeps three independent fallback timers (cmd11, cto, dto)
whose callbacks all re-implement the same race handling: peek MINTSTS
in case the interrupt is in flight, check whether the event was
delivered meanwhile, verify host->state matches the leg being guarded,
and finally synthesize the missed event.  This series replaces them
with a single hrtimer watchdog.

This first step introduces the watchdog and moves the command timeout
onto it; cto_timer is deleted.  Later steps convert the data timeout
and the voltage-switch timer onto the same watch.

The new protocol relies on two simple facts which hold for all current
event producers:

  * every site posting EVENT_CMD_COMPLETE (dw_mci_cmd_interrupt() and
    the command-error branch of dw_mci_interrupt()) runs under
    irq_lock,
  * every site arming a watch does so under irq_lock as well.

Consequently a watchdog callback holding irq_lock can neither miss nor
race an already-delivered event: the bookkeeping part of the former
're-read MINTSTS' paranoia is subsumed by checking the awaited mask
against pending_events under the same lock the producers use.  The
hardware-latency part of that paranoia is kept verbatim, see below.
A callback that raced past every check nonetheless degrades to at most
one idempotent extra state machine run instead of completing a foreign
leg.

The callback classifies what expired by comparing the awaited set
against the named DW_MCI_WD_{CMD,DATA}_EVENTS masks so that subsequent
conversions only add call sites.  dw_mci_wd_arm() takes a separate
'already delivered' precheck mask because guarding the data legs must
tolerate a DATA_ERROR that arrived while still waiting for the paired
completion -- exactly like mod_timer() paths did before.

Behavioral notes for review:

  * dw_mci_wd_arm() replaces any previously armed watch.  During a
    voltage switch (CMD11) both cto_timer and cmd11_timer were armed
    concurrently before, racing each other with duplicated warnings;
    now only the last arm on that path survives.
  * The stale-timer defensiveness of dw_mci_clear_pending_cmd_complete()
    (WARN_ON + timer_delete_sync) is dropped because the callback is now
    idempotent by construction; timer_delete_sync from the BH would also
    be wrong-context sleeping on hrtimers.
  * Before declaring a timeout the callback re-reads MINTSTS: when the
    completion interrupt is already latched in hardware and only its
    handler has not been scheduled yet, the firing grants further
    DW_MCI_WD_INFLIGHT_GRACE_MS rounds instead of failing an about-to-
    complete transfer.  This replicates the interrupt-latency paranoia
    of the retired cto_timer()/dto_timer() callbacks; unlike them it
    keeps re-watching rather than going passive, so if that latched
    interrupt is ultimately lost the request still unwedges with a
    timeout error instead of hanging forever.

No functional change intended beyond the deduplication described above.
