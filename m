taking Aaron into the loop who actually ended up taking over the development.

The plan for the in kernel driver was to intentionally only provide basic 
support. Reason is the current UAPI of the leds subsystem does not offer the 
full flexibility lamp array offers, so it's a challange to map that already. 
Also most current DEs also only support very basic controls interacting with the 
leds subsystem.

If more control is needed a userspace driver should disable the leds subsystem 
control and directly control the device via hidraw. One such driver will 
probably be openRGB in the near future, but it only has initial, currently 
broken support for lamp array.

The driver tries to represent every device as one leds device with one zone to 
not confuse the DEs

Probably something Aaron already fixed on his dev branch, but thanks for 
pointing it out.

Not familiar enough with the code myself to comment on that, but maybe a hint 
for Aaron

Same as above

Unregistering is important for userspace to know what happens, otherwise kde for 
example would still offer brightness control while it isn't actually doing 
anything.

Thanks, I think Aaron did something there too.

I think it's best for Aaron sending his version first and then you reacting on 
that on the LKML and getting in touch. It's unfortunate that parallel work 
happened here.

Also you might wanna take a look at the openRGB userspace implementation for 
LampArray control. It still needs a lot of work. I too dabbled in there but 
still not quite enough.

Best regards,

Werner
