Subject: [PATCH v10 5/8] HID: topping: report the M62's battery level
Date: Mon, 19 Oct 2026 01:57:07 +0500

The M62 runs on its own battery, and a card connected to a computer can
still run down: whether the host charges it depends on a setting of the
card's USB-C port, and nothing on a Linux desktop shows its level.

The card reports the level itself, at 0x11/0x18 in percent: within
seconds of the subscription and again at every change. Offer it as a
power supply of device scope, so that it is never taken for the
system's own battery. The supply is registered only once the first
level has arrived: UPower decides when a device supply appears whether
it is a battery, by reading its capacity, and ignores for good one that
cannot answer yet. Whether it is charging the card does not report, so
the status is unknown.

In Mobile Mode the card announces nothing to a plain subscription, and
its first level came 20 to 30 seconds after it appeared. Inside a
session it announces at once, so the driver now opens one at bind and
at resume as the vendor application does, with the handshake 0x11/0x01
before the subscription and the request to announce: the supply then
appears about 2 seconds after a card is plugged in, in either mode. The
dump of DSP blocks the card adds inside a session carries nothing this
driver exposes, and is ignored.

The card answers the handshake with its mode, 8 to 851 ms after it
here, the latest while it was still sending an announce asked for just
before, and the vendor application sends nothing until that answer has
come; its next frame follows the answer by 4 to 6 ms. In a first bind
that wrote straight after the handshake, the one write that reached the
card 2 ms before the answer was not applied, while the rest were. So
the subscription, the request to announce and everything the audio side
writes after a bind or a resume wait for the answer, or for 3.5 s, a
little longer than an announce lasts, from a card that gives none.

The E2x2 OTG has no battery and gets no supply.
