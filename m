I'm not quite sure if you've read the context carefully :-) or why
you're angry with me.

I did suggest that we should reclaim memory immediately after
writeback completes, both for general memory reclaim and for
`MADV_PAGEOUT`, while Alexandre was working on zswap dropbehind.

Alexandre then found that this might not be a good idea for generic
reclaim, but thought it might still be worth trying for `MADV_PAGEOUT`.
That's why this patch came about.

The discussion between David and me is whether we should do this for
`MADV_PAGEOUT` only, or also apply the same approach to generic
reclaim. So far, we haven't even gotten into the code details.

And this is also the first day I've seen the code. I agree that I can
work with Alexandre to improve the code through review, but please
keep in mind that this is literally my first day looking at it,
my respected Lorenzo. :-)

Best Regards
Barry
