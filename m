There doesn't seem to be much progress on that series. Brendan
volunteered to resurrect the series, taking over from Nikita [0].
But looks like Brendan is not working on this anymore. Will see
if someone is really planning to look at it.

Agree, if the user mode can hit this, a page is mapped in the EL0 and
it can as well cause the Kernel to hit a GPF.
Also if make the handling unconditional, we end up calling
die_kernel_fault() and that does the mem_abort_decode() causing
duplicate logs.
