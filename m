Looking at this a bit more, pd_core doesn't seem to make sense for DSI.
Basically what that does, semantically, is claim that there's a power
domain responsible for powering up and down the device, but in reality
it doesn't to squat.

Does the hang you observe go away if you remove the power-domains
property for DSI? pd_core should probably be removed for both display
controllers and HDMI as well. Probably also TSEC, though the TRM isn't
clear about what power partition that's in (probably DISB because it's
used primary for HDMI, which is in DISB as well).
