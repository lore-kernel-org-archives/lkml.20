budget.c records, for each data block, the largest number of symbols
corrected in any of its codewords: a high-water mark of the correction
capacity the block has used, which reads as the margin it has left.

alert.c sends a KOBJ_CHANGE uevent on the filesystem's kobject when a
threshold is crossed: a block reached zero margin, uncorrectable
codewords within an interval, or blocks at zero margin. Notifications
are rate-limited per class; what to do about them is left to
userspace.

clock.c anchors the monotonic timestamps of the event journal to the
wall clock, with the accuracy of that clock as declared by the
clock_source module parameter.

+ * beamfs -- threshold alerting
+ *
+ * Author: Aurelien DESBRIERES <aurelien@hackers.camp>
+ *
+ * Everything beamfs knows about its own health is already recorded:
+ * dmesg carries each uncorrectable, the RS journal holds coordinates,
+ * the error budget holds remaining margin. All of it has to be looked
+ * at, and on an unattended system nobody looks.
+ *
+ * This notifies. A uevent on the filesystem's kobject when a threshold
+ * is crossed, which udev, systemd or a bare daemon can act on. The
+ * kernel says a line has been crossed and stops there; deciding what
+ * that means -- page an operator, schedule a copy, ground the aircraft
+ * -- is policy, and policy does not belong in a filesystem.
+ *
+ * Three thresholds, each answering a different question:
+ *
+ *   a block reached zero margin      is this volume about to lose data
+ *   uncorrectables in an interval    is it losing data now
+ *   blocks at zero margin            how much of it is at the edge
+ *
+ * Rate-limited per event class, because the failure mode this must not
+ * have is a volume degrading fast enough to bury the operator in
+ * notifications about it.
+ *
+ * No overlap with the report side: this signals that something
+ * happened, and the RS journal, read by the userspace decoder, says
+ * what. A notification carrying its own diagnosis would duplicate the
+ * decoder and drift from it.

+ * beamfs -- clock anchor for the radiation event journal
+ *
+ * Author: Aurelien DESBRIERES <aurelien@hackers.camp>
+ *
+ * Journal entries carry ktime_get_ns(): monotonic since boot, which
+ * orders events exactly and dates none of them. That is the right
+ * clock for an entry -- it cannot jump, so the interval between two
+ * corrections is good to the timer's resolution, and a burst of forty
+ * upsets inside three milliseconds reads as exactly that.
+ *
+ * What it cannot say is when. This supplies the other half: what the
+ * wall clock read at a known point on the monotonic scale, and what
+ * that wall clock was worth at the time.
+ *
+ * Declaring the uncertainty rather than implying a precision is the
+ * whole point. A journal that dates events to the nanosecond on a
+ * machine synchronised by NTP is claiming something it cannot support,
+ * and an auditor who notices that has reason to doubt everything else
+ * in it. Instrumentation states its source and its error; so does this.

+ * What the wall clock is worth, declared rather than guessed.
+ *
+ * The obvious approach -- ask the timekeeping core whether NTP thinks
+ * it is synchronised -- does not work from a module: do_adjtimex is
+ * not exported, and nothing else exposes STA_UNSYNC. Which is just as
+ * well, because "NTP reports itself synchronised" is a weak claim to
+ * build a forensic record on: it says a daemon is running, not that
+ * the clock is right.
+ *
+ * So it is declared. An operator who has deployed PTP with hardware
+ * timestamping knows it and says so; one who has an RTC and nothing
+ * else says that. The journal then carries a claim its owner made
+ * rather than one this code inferred.
+ *
+ * MiFID II takes the same line on trade timestamps: the requirement is
+ * traceability to a stated reference, not a number on its own. A
+ * timestamp whose provenance is unstated is not evidence, whatever its
+ * resolution.
+ *
+ * The interval between two entries is unaffected by any of this. Those
+ * come from ktime_get_ns(), are good to the timer's resolution, and
+ * need no anchor at all -- a burst of forty upsets inside three
+ * milliseconds reads as exactly that on the worst-served machine.
