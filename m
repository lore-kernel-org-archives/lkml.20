That's precisely what MFD is.  It's one chip, usually with a shared and
overlapping register spaces, that conducts multiple functions.  This is
no different to any other single-chip device or SoC.

Shoving everything into a single driver isn't how things are done in
Linux.  This should be divided up into the associated sub-systems where
each part can be reviewed and looked after by the appropriate SMEs.
