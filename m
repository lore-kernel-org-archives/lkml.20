What's the difference? The usual pattern for acquire/release is:

<write data>
<store-release flag>

on one CPU and then on another:

<load-acquire flag>	// If this reads from the release above...
<read data>		// ... then this is guaranteed to read the written data

That's a message-passing shape and you would normally say that the first
CPU (the producer) is publishing the data to the other CPU (the consumer).

Is this what is happening with the 'reset_state' (data) and the
'power_state' (flag)? If not, then what is the shape?

By 'next run' you mean, at EL2 on the entry path into the guest following
a successful CPU_ON operation?

That doesn't make sense to me, sorry. You're saying that the release
store in the EL2 CPU_OFF hypercall handler is ordering stores that were
made during the initial CPU_ON handling on that vCPU? Since then, we've
been in and out of the guest. We really shouldn't need extra barriers to
create order there.

This needs a litmus test because I can't see it myself. As above,
CPU_OFF does not clear the reset state, so it's bizarre to put the
release there.

This confused me more :( Why are you talking about accesses preceding an
acquire? An acquire only orders later accesses.

I really think we need some litmus tests to understand the general ordering
problems we have here before adding the memory barriers.
