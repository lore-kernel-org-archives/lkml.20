Hi Oliver, Leo,

Works for us. I plan to send HDBSS v5 maybe next week with this series
merged in. Both dirty-tracking consumers are already built on top of the
DBM approach: dirty ring and dirty bitmap.

Leo, with your blessing, I'd like to pick patches 1-4 into the HDBSS
tree with your Signed-off-by preserved and mine added on top, plus some
bug fixes on top of this RFC series.

For patch 5, I'd like to rework it into a derived hardware dirty mode
that replaces both kvm_set_hafdbs() and our earlier HDBSS enable/disable
hooks, so the whole thing lands as one series.

Performance looks good in both dirty ring and dirty bitmap scenarios so
far.

Thanks,
Tian
