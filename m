Hi Nicolin,

We tested this series (v11, backported onto our 6.6-based kernel) on two
arm64 server platforms that differ in how PCIe errors are reported: one
with firmware-first reporting (GHES/CPER), the other with OS-first AER
plus DPC. The test triggers a kdump crash (echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger)
on an otherwise idle machine and compares the capture kernel's dmesg
between the unpatched baseline and the kernel carrying this series.

On the firmware-first platform (10 SMMUv3 instances):

   Unpatched, every SMMU logs:

     arm-smmu-v3.0.auto: SMMU currently enabled! Resetting...

   and the destructive reset immediately aborts in-flight DMA. The capture
   kernel then drowns in a storm of GHES/CPER records together with PCIe
   AER "Poisoned TLP" (Data Link Layer) errors from the devices that were
   bus-mastering at crash time. Devices behind the reset SMMUs fail to
   recover in the capture kernel, and in some runs the capture kernel
   hangs in the error storm instead of saving the vmcore.

   With the series applied, all 10 SMMUs log:

     arm-smmu-v3.0.auto: kdump: retaining SMMUEN for in-flight DMA

   and the capture kernel boots with zero AER/GHES error records. A
   complete vmcore is saved and the machine reboots normally.

On the OS-first AER/DPC platform (8 SMMUv3 instances):

   Unpatched: 8x "SMMU currently enabled! Resetting..." followed within
   seconds by PCIe AER Completion Abort errors reported by the root
   complex, along with DPC containment events and EDR notifications. The
   NICs behind the contained link never recover in the capture kernel.

   With the series applied: 8x "kdump: retaining SMMUEN for in-flight DMA",
   no PCIe error events at all, a complete vmcore and a clean reboot.

The baseline symptom is load-independent: it reproduces on idle machines,
since even an idle server has periodic DMA in flight (NIC rings, NVMe
admin queues, etc.).

Overall, on both platforms this series turns a capture-kernel boot that
used to be buried under fatal PCIe error storms into a quiet one that
reliably produces a usable vmcore.
