The three checks came from interpreting BMI2_TARGET_ATTRIBUTE("lzcnt,bmi,bmi2")
as requiring all three feature bits. Agreed that this is unnecessary here.
The kernel path should check only X86_FEATURE_BMI2.

I was also trying to preserve zstd’s standalone-library behavior.
I will instead make normal x86 kernel builds use a helper that expands directly to
cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_BMI2) at each dispatch site. The stored BMI2
context flag and private CPUID probe will be removed from that path.
Preboot and standalone builds will retain their existing caller-provided 
lag and CPUID-based detection.

I will send a revised patch in a little bit.

Thanks!
Usama
