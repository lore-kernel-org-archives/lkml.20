Hi Matt,

Thank you for your reply, please see my comments below.

The problem is that CTX_CS_INDIRECT_CTX_OFFSET is not inhibit by Restore 
inhibit.

If you check the documentation on 
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/tiger-lake.html 
, you can find:

PRM Vol 8:

"When a context is submitted for the first time for execution, SW can 
inhibit engine from restoring engine context by setting the "Engine 
Context Restore Inhibit" bit in CTXT_SR_CTL register of the
logical ring context. This will avoid software from populating the 
Engine Context. Software must program all the state required to 
initialize the engine in the ring buffer which would initialize the
hardware state. On a subsequent context save engine will populate the 
engine context with appropriate values."

And also:

""INDIRECT_CTX" and "INDIRECT_CTX_OFFSET" registers are part of the 
context image and gets restored as part of the given
context's context restore flow, these registers are part of the ring 
context image which are prior to
engine context restore and hence the requirement of the offset being in 
engine context restore."

In other words: "INDIRECT_CTX_OFFSET" is not part of the Engine Context 
(see table on page 49 of the pdf from Vol 8, Engine Context is marked in 
dark blue), it is part of the Ring Context, so Restore Inhibit doesn't 
afect this register, which means it programs 0x0 back to the GPU, which 
is invalid.


Without this patch I get the following:

This is not true for INDIRECT_CTX_OFFSET as stated above (unless I 
missed something).

This is not true for INDIRECT_CTX_OFFSET as stated above (unless I 
missed something).

I understand gt_engine_needs_indirect_ctx() returns true for Alder Lake 
only on XE_ENGINE_CLASS_RENDER, so this is the only one I tested.

I see, thanks for the note.

Even so, I believe that writting a default value in the beggining to 
make ADL happy should't be a problem.

Please let me know if you think I'm missinterpreting things, and thank 
you again for your review/reply.
