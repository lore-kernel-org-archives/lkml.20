That's true only under physical CPU contention right? or is it always?

If it only under contention, then you probably don't want to use low cores for
anything right? If above is yes, then using steal governor would help to avoid low
core if you mark them as non-preferred. (which i guess you guys are exploring already)

But, find_new_ilb isn't aware of preferred CPU state as of initial patches.
I had thought of making a change to pick a idle preferred CPU instead of a idle non-preferred
core for idle load balancing. It is not done due to below reasons.
- Performance numbers didn't show any major improvements with real life workloads.
- Code becomes quite complex for find_new_ilb.

cpu_preferred infra won't allow to spill over if preferred CPUs don't have an idle CPU.
It rather enforces packing onto preferred CPUs even if it means rq has more than 1 task.
