I looked at vendor driver it does not set VCO_IC=0x2 when switch 
a channel. However it does it after wake up from suspend:
https://github.com/ashaffer/rt3573sta/blob/09b80e6290769c53736dc09c5ae9025e15bfbe69/chips/rt3593.c#L194

This function: RT3593ReverseRFSleepModeSetup seams to be partially
the same what NICInitRT3593RFRegisters does. 

Also NICInitRT3593RFRegisters it's different from
rt2800_init_rfcsr_3593() i.e. it set RF_R02 before GPIO_SWITCH.

Could you check if modifying rt2800_init_rfcsr_3593() 
to be more the same with both NICInitRT3593RFRegistersr and
RT3593ReverseRFSleepModeSetup (regarding RF_R06 change)
solve the problem?

I didn't knew about it.

No problem.

I do not have RT3573/RT3593 device by myself and ordinary users
do not read linux-wireless mailing list, so we have rather little
chance to get more test coverage here.

Anyways, if init change that would make rt2800_init_rfcsr_3593()
more like vendor driver do not fix the problem, it's ok to modify
rt2800_config_channel_rf3053(). 

If we want to be more safe with the change, we can limit it with
rt2x00_rt_rev() using 'rev' of your tested device.
