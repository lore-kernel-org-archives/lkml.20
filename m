Well, this is how the issue has been discovered but this is a real y2038
issue.

I gave it some thought for the past month as this is an issue that is
regularly brought up.

The first thing is that this is an issue that disappears as soon as
RTC_HCTOSYS is not used. RTC_HCTOSYS has plenty of issue and one of
those is that is doesn't actually work well with NTP. There is a fix for
this and it would slow down every boot by a second or two.

The main issue is that systemd decided to mandate RTC_HCTOSYS when
raising up the issue, the answer is that it is unacceptable to have logs
that are not properly dated until userspace sets the system time. But
letting userspace set the system time simply solves the issue as it will
always set a time that it can handle, even if not correct.

So, my backup plan was to unconditionally enable the limit so we also
handle the 32bit userspace on 64bit systems and have a new kernel
parameter that would opt-out of the limit. I guess we could have a
warning and point to some documentation if the parameter is missing. We
can avoid the warning when the parameter is present and explicitly opts
in.

Thoughts?
