Add a "Dynamic Capacity Extents" section to cxl-driver.rst, describing
when CXL core accepts an offered extent and when a release request
is acknowledged.

Update maturity-map.rst to reflect initial support for "Extent add /
release event handling".  Overall DCD Support stays at [0] until the
DAX layer plumbing lands and extents become usable.

 Linux does not support unbalanced interleave configurations.  As a result, all
 endpoints in an interleave set must have the same ways and granularity.
 
+Dynamic Capacity Extents
+========================
+
+A `Dynamic Capacity Device (DCD)` advertises capacity in `DC Regions`
+and surfaces individual chunks of that capacity to the host as
+`extents` (CXL r4.0 Section 9.13.3 "Dynamic Capacity Device (DCD)").
+Linux calls a DC Region a `DC partition` (see "DPA Partitions" above)
+so that "region" keeps its software meaning: a :code:`cxl_region` is
+the host-side object that maps DPA into a host physical address range,
+whereas a DC Region is a device-defined slice of DPA space.
+
+Accepting Extents
+-----------------
+Extents are made available to the host through DC Add events: the
+device sends one or more Dynamic Capacity Event Records (CXL r4.0
+Section 8.2.10.2.1.6, Table 8-229) to the host.  Each record carries
+one extent, which the host may accept or reject.  A device offering
+several extents sends one record per extent, chained with `More`: each
+record has the `More` flag set to announce another incoming record,
+until the last record, which carries `More=0` to mark the end of the
+chain.
+
+For each record received, the host stages the offered extent on a
+pending list.  When the chain closes the host knows that every extent
+of this add event has arrived, and the whole pending list is validated
+before anything is accepted.  A chain whose closing record does not
+arrive within 20 seconds is refused as a whole: the watchdog answers
+with an empty Add Dynamic Capacity Response so the device can reclaim
+the offer, and the staged extents are discarded.
+
+From the pending list, extents that share a (non-null) tag are
+extracted into a tag group so that each group can be validated as a
+unit; a group that is accepted becomes a :code:`struct
+cxl_dc_tag_group`.  A tag group is one logical allocation.  An untagged
+extent is an allocation of its own and becomes a single-member group.
+
+Group-level validation (:code:`cxl_validate_group()`,
+:code:`drivers/cxl/core/mbox.c`) drops the whole group if any check
+fails:
+
+* `Host-wide tag uniqueness`: a non-null tag must not already
+  correspond to a live :code:`cxl_dc_tag_group` anywhere on this host.
+  The orchestrator / Fabric Manager owns tag assignment (CXL r4.0
+  Section 9.13.3.1 "DCD Management by FM" and Section 7.6.7.6 "DCD
+  Management Command Set for LD-FAM"); the list in
+  :code:`drivers/cxl/core/extent.c` (:code:`cxl_tag_register()` /
+  :code:`cxl_tag_already_committed()`) catches firmware bugs and
+  orchestrator misbehavior across every region and memdev.  Skipped
+  for the null UUID because there may be multiple untagged extents.
+* `Sequence-number integrity`: extents may be shared across hosts if
+  the device supports memory sharing.  Since a tag group is one
+  logical allocation, every host needs to see the extents of a shared
+  group in the same order; that order is the Shared Extent Sequence
+  Number of each extent (:code:`shared_extn_seq`, Table 8-230).  A
+  sharable group's sequence numbers must form exactly
+  :code:`0, 1, ..., n-1`: sequences with gaps or duplicates, or that
+  do not start at 0, are rejected.  A non-sharable extent must carry
+  0 in the field; that is rejected per extent by
+  :code:`cxl_validate_extent()`, so the group check covers only
+  sharable partitions and the host orders non-sharable extents by
+  arrival.
+* `Partition equality`: every tagged extent in the group must resolve
+  to the same DC partition.  A single allocation cannot span
+  partitions because CDAT describes sharable / writable / coherency
+  attributes per partition.  Skipped for the null UUID.
+* `Alignment`: every extent's :code:`start_dpa` and :code:`length`
+  must be :code:`PMD_SIZE`-aligned, the alignment the DAX region is
+  created with.  If any extent is misaligned the whole group is
+  dropped: accepting only the aligned subset would leave an unusable
+  allocation.
+
+After group-level validation each extent is validated individually
+(:code:`cxl_add_extent()`, :code:`drivers/cxl/core/extent.c`).  A tag
+group is accepted whole or not at all: for sharable capacity the spec
+requires it (Section 8.2.10.9.9.3, otherwise the device returns Invalid
+Extent List), and an allocation missing an extent would be unusable
+either way.  So an extent that fails any of these checks drops its
+whole group:
+
+* The extent's DPA range must lie within a DC partition of the memdev
+  (:code:`cxl_extent_dc_partition()`).  On a sharable partition the
+  extent must carry a tag; on a non-sharable one its shared extent
+  sequence must be 0.
+* The extent's DPA range must resolve to a CXL region via
+  :code:`cxl_dpa_to_region()`.  An extent with no owning region is
+  dropped, as is one whose :code:`dax_region` has not finished its
+  probe-time scan or has no driver bound (see Recovery below).
+* The extent's DPA range must be fully contained in the endpoint
+  decoder's DPA range.  An extent that straddles the decoder boundary
+  is dropped; the driver never clips an extent to fit.
+* The extent must not overlap or repeat an extent already present in
+  the same region (:code:`cxlr_dax_classify_extent()`).  A range the
+  host already accepted drops its group: the device rejects a DPA
+  range reported twice in an Add response (CXL r4.0 8.2.10.9.9.3,
+  Invalid Physical Address).
+
+Surviving tag groups are registered with the device model by
+:code:`online_tag_group()`: a tagged group becomes a
+:code:`tag_groupX.Y` child of the :code:`dax_region` device and every
+member :code:`dc_extent` an :code:`extentX.Y` child of it, while an
+untagged extent goes under the region's :code:`untagged` device.  The
+host then tells the device which extents it accepted with an Add
+Dynamic Capacity Response (CXL r4.0 Section 8.2.10.9.9.3, opcode 4802h)
+per chain, split across several commands chained with the More flag
+when the extent list outgrows the mailbox payload; an extent left out
+of the response is rejected.
+
+Extents the device already reserves for a region, for instance after a
+host crash, are recovered when the region's :code:`dax_region` probes:
+:code:`cxl_region_add_existing_extents()` reads the device's extent
+list (Get Dynamic Capacity Extent List, Section 8.2.10.9.9.2, opcode
+4801h), keeps the extents inside the region's decoder (the list covers
+every DC partition of the device) and runs them through the same
+validation with :code:`existing` set.  No Add Dynamic Capacity Response
+is sent for them, and a recovered group that fails validation or does
+not online is released back to the device.  Add events for the region
+are refused until that scan completes, and again once the driver
+unbinds: unbinding returns every held extent to the device, so the next
+probe scans afresh.
+
+Releasing Extents
+-----------------
+
+A release may be initiated by the device (a Release Capacity event) or
+by the host, for example when tearing down a region.  A host may also
+issue a Release Dynamic Capacity Response not associated with any
+event, an "unsolicited release", at any time (CXL r4.0 Section 9.13.3).
+The host-initiated path runs :code:`dc_tag_group_teardown()` for each
+tag group of the region: it invalidates the region's cached lines,
+returns the group with its own Release Dynamic Capacity Response and
+unregisters its extents.  The device-initiated path goes through the
+release chain in :code:`drivers/cxl/core/mbox.c`.
+
+A device-initiated release may span several event records chained with
+the More flag, exactly like an add event.  Each record is staged in
+:code:`mds->dc_chain` by :code:`handle_dcd_chain_event()`, the same
+chain an add event uses, until the chain closes (More flag cleared).
+Chained records shall be contiguous and share one event type (CXL r4.0
+Table 8-229), so add and release records cannot coincide; should a
+record of the other type arrive inside an open chain, the open chain is
+aborted (an add chain with an empty Add Dynamic Capacity Response, a
+release chain silently) and the record starts a new chain.  A chain
+whose closing record never arrives is dropped by the 20 second watchdog
+the same way, so the capacity stays provisioned for the host and the
+device may retry.
+
+When the chain closes, :code:`cxl_rm_pending()` processes the extents
+staged in the pending list.  As mentioned above, a tag group is one
+logical allocation, so requesting the release of any extent in a group
+releases the whole group.  Members of the group missing from the event
+record chain (an FM mistake or firmware bug) are still included in the
+Release Dynamic Capacity Response as a "generous" policy.
+
+Each extent pending release is processed:
+
+* The extent is resolved by :code:`cxl_resolve_extent()` to its CXL
+  region and :code:`cxl_dc_tag_group`.
+* An extent the host does not own is acknowledged so the device knows
+  the host is not using it: its DPA range resolves to no region, to a
+  region whose :code:`cxlr_dax` is not set up, or to a range that
+  overlaps nothing the host owns (for example, an extent left over
+  from a host crash that has not yet been re-claimed, or a duplicate
+  release racing region teardown).
+* An extent that overlaps capacity the host owns without matching any
+  single accepted extent (it straddles two extents, or the tag
+  disagrees) is held: it is left out of the response so the device
+  retains the capacity for the host and may retry.
+* An extent that names an owned extent releases its group through
+  :code:`cxl_release_tag_group()`: the backing memregion is
+  invalidated once for the group and :code:`rm_tag_group()`
+  unregisters every member :code:`dc_extent` device.  If the
+  invalidation fails, or the :code:`dax_region`'s unbind already owns
+  the group's teardown, the group is left out of the response, so the
+  device retains the capacity and may retry.
+
+After processing the pending list, every extent the host is giving
+back is sent to the device in the Release Dynamic Capacity Response
+(Section 8.2.10.9.9.4, opcode 4803h), mirroring the Add response.  A
+list that does not fit in one mailbox payload is sent as several
+commands chained with the More flag.
