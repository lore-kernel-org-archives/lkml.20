Perhaps. These two devices have nothing in common but the name.

Your device is thunderbolt only, but 2022, 2023 and 2024
xg mobiles that his patch targets are devices for which the
ACPI of laptops supporting this weird connector is full of
references to and handling and custom code all over the place.

They are nothing alike. They share the name....

If I connect mine to my rog ally armoury crate gains a
slider that sends the exact same command my patch sends...

I couldn't find anything else over USB with wireshark:
everything else is ACPI-driven.

I answer to this below, but I want to point out something here:
you are right in wanting to join these, but wrong on what to join:
the right thing to do is not to join the ALLY_REPORT_SIZE and the
XGM report size, but instead to join the  KBD report size and the
ally one as one NKEY_REPORT_SIZE since this is exactly what they
are: N-KEY devices.

Absolutely bad idea, trust me: I have recently followed the fix
of a regression I introduced sending a 64-bytes command to
touchpads that accepts some other length as those stopped
working. Doing that is asking for troubles. Listen to who
caused the trouble already and make the most out of my
mistakes.

I also had to make asusctl send exactly 64-bytes commands
because of random bugs to zephyrus and strix models.
Sending 65 bytes to anime matrix is not a very good idea either.

Also Armoury Crate never sends anything different to 64 bytes
to N-key devices and I do not want to send anything different
than windows does.

Do you remember what happens to rainbow on ROG ally if you send
commands the MCU doesn't like? I don't want having weird things
difficult to debug and nearly impossible to recover from only because
the code would look better/be shorter.

These devices are fragile in handling, tied to the EC and low lever
hardware and I absolutely don't want to diverge from what
Armoury Crate does unless there is a very good reason to it.

I agree that ASUS devices are somewhat forgiving in accepting
different lengths, unlike MSI claws that will not answer to
commands until you have sent a number of bytes multiple of
the length they want, but this is no reason to toy around this.

If with "the new kernel" you mean 7.3 I can tell you it appears
d3 is broken and some ASUS laptops stopped entering s2idle...

2022, 2023 and 2024 models don't blink outside of s2idle...
Because ACPI is all over the place and the device gets informed
constantly of what the host is doing.

If 2025 models blink until you bind the driver it that means they
rely on commands from the windows application... We will need
to replicate those as closely as possible.

I can ask ASUS if wireshark captures don't shed some lights to it.

What I propose is correct for old models. Newer ones I know nothing
about except that there is no custom ACPI handling them.


> Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Honestly I think you should name those something like xgb_tb_.....
and handle them separately since they have pretty much nothing
in common... Except the price maybe. Lol.

In general don't go crazy over refactors and trying to make the
code looks better at the expense of proven things: the priority
is for this driver to work reliably and to reuse as much things
proven to work as possible.
