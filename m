Hi,

as promised, this is an updated version of the MPAM-Fb code, for firmware
based MSC accesses.
There are not many changes, the most prominent one is preparation for an
update to the "ACPI for MPAM" specification (Arm DEN0065 [2]), which adds
an MPAM-Fb offset field, to allow private IDs per PCC channel, but still
maintain globally unique MSC IDs. The spec is not public yet, but I added
two small patches on top that would implement the change. Also the msc
struct gains a field to hold that per-PCC value. This allows to support
systems with more than one MPAM-Fb manager (read: PCC channel).

Find the changelog below. Based on v7.3-rc1.

=======================
The Arm MPAM specification defines Memory System Components (MSCs),
which are devices that are programmed through an MMIO register frame. In
some occasions this turned out to be too limiting: the MSC might be
located behind a separate bus system (for instance inside an on-board
controller), it might be mapped secure-only, or in a different processor
socket without direct MMIO mapping. Also the MMIO access might be too slow
or it would need to be filtered or otherwise access controlled. Finally
there might be bugs in the MSC integration, which require a mediating
firmware to be accessible.

To accommodate all those different use cases, the MPAM-Fb specification
[1] describes an alternative way to access MSCs. Accesses to an MSC
would be wrapped in a message and communicated to the system using a
shared-memory/mailbox system mostly mimicking the Arm SCMI spec.
For ACPI systems, this would be abstracted through an ACPI PCC channel,
which provides the shared-memory region and the mailbox trigger. We can
lean on existing ACPI parsing code to register with these two
subsystems, but cannot rely on the existing SCMI code in the kernel.
This means we somewhat need to open code a very simplified SCMI handler,
which just provides enough functionality for the very basic subset of
SCMI that the MPAM-Fb spec requires.

The first eight patches rework all MSC access wrappers to propagate error
information. Pure MMIO based MSC accesses would never fail, but the
MPAM-Fb access can go wrong in multiple ways. The patches have been split
up purely for reviewing reasons, if the number is a problem, we could as
well squash them. Please note that until the very last patch of this series
any MSC accesses would always only return 0, it's only the final enablement
of MPAM-Fb that could possibly introduce errors. Hence all former patches
can add error handling gradually, those code paths wouldn't be triggered
before patch 12/14.
Patch 9/14 solves a nasty problem: At the moment we protect stateful MSC
register accesses (mon_sel) through a spinlock. Unfortunately the mailbox
subsystem and the slow nature of the communication through this channel
forbid MPAM-Fb access in atomic context. So this patch keeps using a
spinlock for MMIO based accesses, but reverts to a mutex otherwise.
We just deny taking the lock for MPAM-Fb in atomic context, ideally we
wouldn't need that (no need to IPI another core when the MSC access does
not need to be local to one particular core), or we simply deny that part
of the functionality (access through perf).
Patch 10/14 adds the code to redirect MSC accesses through the
PCC shmem/mailbox system.
Patch 11/14 reworks the error interrupt handler to use a threaded IRQ for
MPAM-Fb, to be able to do MPAM-Fb MSC accesses inside (which might sleep).
Patch 12/14 then adds the code to detect and store the PCC channel
information from the ACPI tables, and eventually enables MPAM-Fb accesses.

The final two patches (marked as RFC) implement an "ACPI for MPAM"
specification change, which introduces an MPAM-Fb Offset field, which
holds the difference between the globally unique MSC IDs as stored in the
"Identifier" field of the ACPI MSC node table, and the MSC ID to be used
in the MPAM-Fb protocol. For a single MPAM-Fb manager/PCC channel, this is
irrelevant, but multiple channels require that change.

This whole series would enable systems where some MSCs are not accessible
via MMIO to use those components anyway.

Please have a look and test!

Cheers,
Andre
