I tested on an Orion O6. Here's the difference before and after removing
the threshold right now.

Before:
0.02user 0.07system 0:00.10elapsed 98%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata
87332maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+21133minor)pagefaults 0swaps

After:
1.67user 4.91system 0:06.63elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata
4195564maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+2225058minor)pagefaults 0swaps

I think instead of the time taken, the more concerning thing here is RSS
(85MB vs 4GB).

Yup, makes sense. I will implement this then.
