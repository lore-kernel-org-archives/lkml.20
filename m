I still think the reasoning that we omit them because they are not
contained in kvm_cpu_caps[] sounds not right. Based on it, so when we are
going to add a new feature for TDX, we need to first manually check the KVM
code to see if that feature is contained in kvm_cpu_caps[] already. If not,
we just don't add it to TDX's list. Then why need to cap the result
kvm_cpu_caps[] for TDX_CFG_F() again? Just for safety in case human make
mistake and misread the code of kvm_cpu_caps[]?

I think they are two independent steps:
1. list the CPUID features that KVM can support for TDs.
2. apply additional restrictions, e.g., if a feature is not allowed for
non-TDX VMs, it cannot be allowed for TDs.

For existing features, it might make some sense. But for new features, I
don't think so. It defines the enabling order for new features that we must
enable a feature for non-TDX VMs first and then TDs. And people might want
to bypass this rule by abusing the TDX_CFG_EXTRA_F() when only one line of
TDX_CFG_EXTRA_F() is enough to enable a feature for TDs but more effort
required to enable it for non-TDX VMs.

Maybe I miss somthing. I would like to see stronger reasons for such decision.
