We might need new names for pci_enable_link_state(),
pci_disable_link_state(), and the quirk thing.  If we keep the same
names, I think it will be pretty complicated to manage the changing
semantics when backporting driver changes that use them.

By parallel sources, are you thinking of sysfs and driver calls?  If
locking would be sufficient I think that would end up being simpler.

But maybe the issue is these devices where we think ASPM breakage only
happens in certain circumstances, e.g., firmware download, so we want
to keep states disabled for that period.  Then I guess locking inside
the enable/disable doesn't prevent sysfs from enabling those states
during that period.

I'm not sure what this looks like to the caller.  A parameter that
says whether to count the disable?

I think having a different function name would be helpfully
descriptive because permanently removing an advertised capability is
different from temporarily disabling a feature.
