With CONFIG_PER_VMA_LOCK I'm decreasing the headroom by 4 bytes, I'll add a
few sentences in the changelog.

The motivation is to first disambiguate fault reason and VMA registration
mode and second create a per-VMA state for uffd for future use.
AFAIR Sean mentioned during guest_memfd discussions that a few status bits
would have been useful there.

Standard shipped kernels have CONFIG_PER_VMA_LOCK=y which makes VMAs padded
to the next cacheline so adding a field there only decreases padding.

I can also move vm_uffd_state after pfnmap_track_ctx to keep it in the end
so there won't be 4 bytes hole.

If/when we run out of space, we can allocate uffd state separately, but
it's more involved so I don't think it's necessary at this point.

The check is explicit in vma_needs_copy().

As I replied to David, 'USERFAULT' means the type of the fault.
For modes, or flags, UFFD_ is the "subsystem" namespace.

It can't be in userfaultfd_ctx. It's essentially the backpointer to the
file descriptor context.

I'll make these BIT(31) - BIT(28) ;-)

I'll see how to improve the naming.

Since the field lives in mm_types.h it'd require "include userfaultfd_k.h"
to make this an enum.

I see your point, will rename to some *flags*.

No, it isn't. This is under #ifdef CONFIG_USERFAULTFD that depends on
CONFIG_MMU so VMA_UFFD is defined.

It's an interesting API engineering, where the most obvious API does not
always work and one needs to verify the bit definitions to understand what
exact API variant to use.

I don't see how it'll be clearer. How

	userfault_test_single_mask(mode, UFFD_MODE_WP_BIT)

is better than a plain == comparison?

I'll rethink the naming.

Would run out of 80 chars :(

But I'm thinking now to add one more patch to get rid from passing wp_async

Yeah, I'll make it bit 12. Really curious why that one wasn't #ifdefed on
something.

I don't agree that replacing plain bit operations with long multiword
predicates makes the code clearer.

Userfault is a complex beast and using, say,
userfault_test_mode_bit_set(mode, UFFD_MODE_MISSING_BIT) instead of 
mode & UFFD_MODE_MISSING won't make it any less complex.

flags could work, yes.
 
uffd and userfault have different semantic meaning in the context of this
series, userfault is a type of the page fault forwarded to user space, uffd
is the namespace of userfault subsystem.
