I do agree that's what we should have, I started down that route but as
I noted in the commit log it felt like I was pulling in disproportionate=20
refactoring given the existing gap.

I went with erroring out there to make sure that we didn't make any
mistakes with the ordering of our checks - I didn't want to accidentally
end up with a situation where we look at the dependencies for feature A,
decide that it's OK, then later check feature B which it depends on and
turn it off due to it missing it's own prerequisite.

We can resolve that like you've done here by having the full dependency
stack in every check but I worried that this would be error prone due to
all the duplication, however looking at your code I think we can resolve
that anyway, see blow.

Userspace really shouldn't be setting up guests where we need to make
adjustments in the first place, and setting up guests isn't that hot a
path so like Marc says so long as KVM protects itself we're fine.

This will mean that every time we check for an individual feature
throughout KVM we check for all the dependencies as well.  A lot of the
time that's not really going to matter but we have these checks in hot
paths like context switches.

We should put the dependencies in here where they're only checked during
initialisation instead, that way the hot paths only need to look at the
leaf features.  We could also deal with the duplication concern by
having the functions call each other rather than duplicating their
contents:

	static bool feat_gcs(struct kvm *kvm)
	{
		if (!feat_s1pie(kvm))
			return false;

		return kvm_has_gcs(kvm);
	}

(or whatever stylistic variation of that.) =20

This approach also needs the code for updating the ID registers since
config.c doesn't do that at the moment.  Some of the existing visibility
limiting stuff (like for 32 bit ID registers without AArch32 or
ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 without SVE) could be moved over too.

TBH when I said in the commit log I was thinking of something more data
driven I was thinking more of having the dependencies expressed as pure
data, more like the way the test in set_id_regs is written.  This also
seems fine to me, the checks are similar.  It's just much more invasive.
