I still don't quite get the scenario.

Maybe it's just because I (still) don't understand how autofs
is implicated.

By definition an indirect mount is an autofs file system that
triggers mounts in the root directory of the autofs mount and
those entries must be empty directories. So I don't get how
accessing /sys/power/resume can result in triggering an automount.
At least that's how it reads to me from my admittedly autofs
centric POV.

If there is something missing from autofs that could be used to
prevent this scenario then I'd be happy to implement that.

The above paragraph reads like the autofs file system needs to
check request paths are within the autofs file system but that
doesn't make sense either because that that would mean there's
an autofs mount on /sys/power. But it is stated below there
isn't an autofs mount within kernfs so rejecting autofs file
system mounts within kernfs won't help.

Note that an autofs direct mount might be susceptible to this
as well.

I'm sorry, there's just not enough path information to work out if
there's something going on that should be checked for and rejected.

As I say, it sounds like, the only valid indirect mount request
must be triggered by a sub-directory of /sys/power which is a
mountpoint within kernfs (or maybe we are talking sysfs) which
could be rejected in the autofs mount code.

But it's not straight forward to be sure about which file systems
should not allow auto-mounting but is probably doable. For example,
systemd (direct) mounts /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc but mostly proc
should not allow auto-mounting.

I think this is what's causing me trouble.

Such a request should never be sent over the pipe, there should
be validity checks in autofs to prevent it. Unfortunately I'm
not sure about the path info.
