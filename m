Hi,

the whole Linux logo on the console is somewhat gimmicky and IMHO should 
not be further extended. Also fbdev as a whole has realistically run its 
course. We fix bugs and occasionally clean up the code, but it is 
questionable whether new feature make much sense. Even more so as the 
drivers your system uses appear to be DRM ones.

There is a proposal for a DRM splash screen at [1]. It retrieves the 
device vendor's logo from the firmware and displays it at the given 
coordinates. IMHO you should start with this series and add DT support 
there.

Best regards
Thomas

> Changes since v2:
>    - Rebased onto current mainline (v7.3-rc3).
>    - Dropped the "linux," prefix from the compatible, and renamed the
>      binding to match, per Rob.
>    - A rotation asked for by the device tree now turns the logo and not the
>      screen: "logo-position" and "logo-offset" stay in screen pixels, and a
>      quarter turn only changes how much room the logo takes up. v2 fed the
>      device tree rotation into the path fbcon uses for a rotated console,
>      which places the logo in the console's own frame and maps the result
>      back, so a vertical offset came out horizontal on a screen that was not
>      rotated. Found by testing it on the panel. fb_rotate_logo() is split
>      into the part that turns the image and the part that moves the
>      placement, and the console path is unchanged.
>    - The placement properties are read in logo.c, next to the image, and the
>      frame buffer code only asks for the result, so that the binding is
>      parsed in a single place.
>    - Added patch 1, which pulls the logo position out into something both
>      fb_prepare_logo() and fb_show_logo_line() share, after Helge pointed out
>      that the placement patch was stamped in rather than merged with the
>      existing code. That turned up a real bug: the reservation took the larger
>      of the console position and the device tree one while the drawing took
>      only the device tree one.
>    - IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdef, per Helge, so the code is compile checked
>      whatever the configuration.
>    - The device tree is read once, from fb_prepare_logo(), rather than from
>      every accessor.
>    - Dropped "logo-centered" for -1 in "logo-position", per Helge.
>    - The position and offset are added in 64 bits and both are bounded in the
>      binding; in int, a large pair from the device tree wrapped instead of
>      landing against an edge.
>    - The copy of the image is no longer freed from a late initcall, which ran
>      before async_synchronize_full() and so could pull it out from under a
>      display driver still probing. Pixels are allocated with kvmalloc().
>    - The example declares compatible and model on the root node, and the
>      binding no longer requires the image properties unconditionally, which
>      made the reserved memory form unreachable. Both found by Rob's bot.
>    - Extra logos are not drawn when the device tree supplied the logo; they
>      stack up from an arbitrary point once it has been placed.
