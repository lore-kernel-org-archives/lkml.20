While I agree with this line of argument, I am bit worried that there is
more deviation from ACPI _LPI binding(equivalent to these in DT). If other
OS has manged to run the same firmware without adding such information
to the firmware(ACPI in this case), why do we need that in DT. Is that
information encoded elsewhere in a different form in ACPI and is this the
right place(the idle state binding for DT) is what I am trying to understand
here.

Also taking the example of screen on, won't that be prevented as the
system domain is shared by the system level idle-states we are talking
and the screen/display device. So it never votes to power down that
and the PSCI OSI domain idle driver must not be able to choose the system
level state.

In general, there is some device that doesn't vote to power down the domain
and hence we can't enter the state. So my question is, will there be some
device that doesn't explicitly register vote and hence we need an alternate
mechanism like the one proposed in this set ? If so, what are those and
how does that work in system suspend states.

Or am I missing something more fundamental the makes all the above argument
void.
