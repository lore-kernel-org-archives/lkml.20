Sorry, my bad. I used LLM to find Nhat's words. But I did check it by
myself. I wrote most of them by myself. While at it ath the moment, my
logic could be unclear.

As said, how swap_cluster_info[] is built is the foundation. Whatever
you do, you have to make swap_cluster_info[] ready, then you can do
writeback, rmap lookup, thp support, etc, on top of it.
swap_cluster_info[] is the basement, then you continue building 2nd
floor, 3rd floor, till a high building is done with things added. Nobody
wants to claim he just need the high building, while no basement.

Now, the foundation has been built with the lazy vmalloc, it can grow on
demand. It keeps swap_cluster_info accessing as swap_cluster_info[],
a basic array semantics. And since we our target is to support a very
large swap device with an extendable logical space, grow on demand and
shrink becomes important. Now it is there.

That's my understanding, not sure if there's anything I can't get so
that writeback need be made first.
