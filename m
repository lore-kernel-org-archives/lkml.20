And I guess asymmetric fabrics must mean fabrics where Request
Redirect and Completion Redirect are not set the same way?

I don't think there's anything in this whole series that changes any
ACS settings, so I shouldn't have wondered about *preserving* the
ordering rule.

But I asked about ordering because it sounds like this patch expects
to encounter asymmetric fabrics where Request Redirect and Completion
Redirect may not be set the same way, and the spec implies that
asymmetry may result in ordering violations.

I'd rather use "Requester" and "Completer" when possible because they
have specific meanings in the PCI spec and they correspond to the ACS
control bits.  Client, provider, target, initiator are all from the
outer world that makes use of PCIe constructs, but they don't mean
anything inside the PCIe world.
