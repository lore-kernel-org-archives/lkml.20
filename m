Writing back from one swap tier to another doesn't exist right now. I
have not even seen a coherent design to support writeback among swap
tiers. You're just delivering pie-in-the-sky.

The RFC you mentioned is not writeback between tiers. If you think it
does, then maybe you should read it again, It's from a very specific
swap device (xswap, with zswap backend), to a swapfile. Here is what
it does: add an array to store indirection (physical swap entry) to
clusters, and update that array when we need to do backend transfer.

Does that ring a bell? That's because it's the exact same mechanism as
vswap (without proper attribution - not even Suggested-by). If
anything, it's actually a bit less coherent, because you can set xswap
to be lower priority than physical swapfile.

Vswap does not have that, because vswap is not an ordinary swap
device. It's implementing the concept of virtualization (the "V" in
VFS, if you want to make that analogy), made optional to reduce
overhead when indirection is not needed. That gives you all the
machinery you need for backend transfer: a centralized virtualized
layer, where you can update the backend, without having to go and
chase down all the external references - no PTE walk needed.

See above. But transferring between tier is still not a solved problem.

The problem is the interface and the charging question. We have put
out our objections to it, and so far we have not been satisfied with
the defence.

If they don't turn it on, their code works as is. Their existing
/etc/fstab exhibits no behavioral change.

What you're asking is us *enrolling* in that same interface. And my
question is what does that interface give us? I already pointed out
multiple ways where that interface's generality shoots the user in the
foot.

It's a boottime parameter.

Why would you care about swapoff? What use case does it serve?

>

You're describing an interface, again. It's still not a use case.

I can promise that it won't break /etc/fstab if vswap is off. - if it
does then it's a bug and I can fix it.

I already pointed out how xswap's design *creates* problem, including
userspace problem. You just handwaved it away with "let the users
shoot themselves in the foot". I disagree with that philosophy.
