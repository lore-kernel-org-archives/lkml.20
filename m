But what does this mean for an importer that has no idea the exporter no
longer exists? Will it crash? I think the revoke flow actually fixes this hot-remove case.

Sure, will change.

I will try to rephrase in next version.

How will you split them?

In API level yes, but I'm not sure that failure in map_dma_buf is equal
logically to failure in attach. So, I won't call it "rejected later".
