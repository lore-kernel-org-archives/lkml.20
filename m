Yes; this conversation is helping me to see that... :)

I was originally trying to avoid creating any globally visible entity that
describes a "domain", since I thought there was a possibility that each process
might want to define it's own view of a domain. But in hindsight I don't think
that's helpful...

...This all feels much clearer and simpler. I'll work on an approach like this.
