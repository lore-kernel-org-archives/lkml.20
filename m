Good point.  I was just missing this.  So, hugepage_mem_bp is not accounting
anon mTHPs, right?  Since hugepage_mem_bp is for general hugepages, I think
this is better to be improved.  Seems using MTHP_STAT_NR_ANON that is exposed
as 'nr_anon' can be used?  Because this is an improvement rather than a fix of
a bug, I think doing this as either a followup or new version of this series
are ok.  Asier, what do you think?

Actually it can target multiple processes if those are in single DAMON context.

I think it is intentional.  The user should have the control on collapsing
hugepages, or believe the uncontrolled collapse mechanisms.

More documentation and testing are always welcome :)

Yes, those would be helpful.  That's not mandatory for this simple change in my
opinion, though.  I would let Asier decide whether and when to make and share
such data.

Your comments are very helpful, thank you for your review and comments, Lian.

I agree.

Thank you!

I'm curious if you and general reviewers need or prefer to directly be Cc-ed.
I was naively thinking people can search and review DAMON patches by
subscribing to the mailing list or using the archives via lore.kernel.org like
tools.


Thanks,
SJ
