I took a rough look at a few existing filesystems and had an LLM help
put things together.

Actually triggering it needs all of:
(1) a large folio straddling the punch/truncate boundary, so the
    in-range part is zeroed and the out-of-range part holds valid data;
(2) that folio dirty, so the out-of-range tail exists only in the
    pagecache;
(3) no filesystem private data on the folio (or ->release_folio()
    returning success), so the first folio_split() in
    truncate_inode_partial_folio() can succeed.

Filesystems that enable large folios fall into three groups, none of
which can currently satisfy all three:

- buffer_head / private-based (ext4, btrfs, ...): a dirty folio
  always carries fs private state (buffer_head, extent state), so
  ->release_folio() returns false and folio_split() aborts with -EBUSY
  before the first split — condition (3) fails.
- netfs (afs, nfs, smb, ...): AP_RELEASE_ALWAYS is set but
  netfs_release_folio() returns false on a dirty folio — same effect,
  condition (3) fails.
- iomap (xfs, zonefs, erofs): these can have dirty large folios
  without private data, but none reach the unsafe window — xfs always
  runs filemap_write_and_wait_range() (xfs_flush_unmap_range) before
  punching, so the boundary folio is clean; zonefs has no punch-hole;
  erofs is read-only. With the tail already on disk (clean), discarding
  the straddling folio loses nothing.

So on 7.2 and earlier I cannot find a reachable trigger path. It only
becomes reachable on the upcoming ext4 + iomap buffered-I/O path, which
for the first time combines large folios + no private data on
fully-dirtied folios + missing pre-punch writeback.

I took an initial look at Sashiko's review report. I think the
issue is valid — the current fix can get the wrong folio2 index
when there's a concurrent split. I need to think more about how
to fix it properly.

Thanks,
Yi.
