Yup :) we are a bit inundated with AI fixes these days.

Great, thanks for the background! Yeah it'd be good to include all that!

I guess I'm fishing for the security justification, but maybe that ship sailed
:) but it'd be helpful to also include that.

Yeah I typo'd that haha, doh! And it just happens to be a function :) yes
__install_special_mapping().

I think the easiest would be to just seal them too.

Thanks, but with the proposed alternative approach, we can just yeet this from
the code anyway! :)

Yeah it's awkward, really moving the tests to mm we'd have to skip them if the
vdso isn't sealed, then assume a sealed vdso for a new process = feature
enabled.

I guess at that point it's redundant to check if disabled?

No worries!
