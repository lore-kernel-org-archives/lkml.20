It doesn't work in the sense that it doesn't do what you want.  But fair en=

I'm not sure about that, but OK, say it's just an example.

And it is not designed to do so.

Of course, it will not prevent the parent from suspending if the child
does not attempt to resume it for a time longer than its autosuspend
delay.  That's by design and you didn't have to take the time to
demonstrate it.

The question is how often those kinds of patterns occur in practice.
Or IOW, whether or not they occur often enough to justify adding
complexity related specifically to addressing them.

OK, I'll say more about that tomorrow (it's past 10 PM here, time to
go away from the keyboard).

That depends on what problem in particular you mean.

It addresses an inconsistency in rpm_resume() and as I said above,
this needs to be done anyway because it is not only related to the
cases when children or consumers are involved.  There are other cases
in which rpm_resume() gets called for an active device and the lack of
last_busy update causes the device to suspend earlier than expected.

> and my solution does while also handling

I'm not sure about that.

For example, say a device has an autosuspend delay of 2 s.  Say it is
initially suspended and user space writes "on" to its "power/control",
so the device resumes.  Now, 1 s later, user space writes "auto" to
the device's "power/control" and the autosuspend delay is respected,
so the device doesn't suspend.  Next, 1.5 s after the first resume,
user space writes "on" to the device's "power/control" and the device
does not resume because it is active (its last_busy is not updated).
Finally, user space writes "auto" to the device's "power/control", say
1 s later, and the device suspends even though it can be expected to
stay active for at least 1 s more.

How is that going to be addressed by propagating last_busy from
children/consumers to parents/suppliers?

Note that I'm not dismissing your proposal, I'm just having doubts
about the need to do this kind of thing in the core code.
