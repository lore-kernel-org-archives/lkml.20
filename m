can: peak_usb: harden channel handling in PCAN-USB FD

The PCAN-USB FD decoders now check record channel numbers against the
adapter's controller count. They also reject records whose usb_if->dev[]
slot is empty, and pcan_usb_fd_free() clears a channel's slot.

The patch also adds peak_usb_stop_rx(), which clears CONNECTED under RTNL
and poisons the RX anchors. It is called on the probe error path and in
peak_usb_disconnect() before channels are freed.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does this CONNECTED test close the
window where the netdev is visible before its private data is set up?

peak_usb_create_dev() sets CONNECTED and calls register_candev(). Only
after that does it call dev_init():

	set_bit(PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED, &dev->state);
	...
	err = register_candev(netdev);
	...
	if (dev->adapter->dev_init) {
		err = dev->adapter->dev_init(dev);

Until pcan_usb_fd_init() runs, pdev->usb_if and pdev->cmd_buffer_addr are
still NULL. Can userspace configure or open the netdev in that window?
That would make pcan_usb_fd_start() dereference pdev->usb_if, or make the
bittiming command builders use the NULL cmd_buffer_addr.

The later commit "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" appears to fix this. It moves register_candev() into
peak_usb_probe(), after all channels are initialized.

[Severity: Medium]
Does clearing CONNECTED here suppress the shutdown commands that ndo_stop
sends for a channel that is already open?

On this path the netdev is still registered and may be up. The later
unregister_candev() runs peak_usb_ndo_stop(), which calls dev_stop() and
dev_set_bus(dev, 0). With CONNECTED now clear, pcan_usb_fd_send_cmd()
returns early:

	/* usb device unregistered? */
	if (!test_bit(PCAN_USB_STATE_CONNECTED, &dev->state))
		return 0;

Before this patch, CONNECTED was still set when ndo_stop ran here. Could
a probe failure now leave the controller bus-on, with calibration records
still streaming, while the device stays attached?

The later commit "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" removes peak_usb_stop_rx() from adap_dev_free, and
no netdev is registered on this path there.

peak_usb_disconnect() still clears CONNECTED before it unregisters an open
channel, but the old loop already did that before unregister_candev().

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but is it safe to call
dev_free() before unregister_candev() on this error path?

If the failing channel has no siblings, pcan_usb_fd_free() frees the
shared objects:

	kfree(pdev->cmd_buffer_addr);
	...
	kfree(pdev->usb_if);

The code then falls through to lbl_unregister_candev and calls
unregister_candev() on a netdev that is registered and possibly open.
Wouldn't peak_usb_ndo_stop() -> pcan_usb_fd_stop() then access the freed
usb_if?

	pdev->usb_if->dev_opened_count--;

pcan_usb_fd_set_bus() would also build its command in the freed
cmd_buffer_addr.

The later commit "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" also fixes this, because no netdev is registered
by the time adap_dev_free is reached.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can an asynchronous restart URB outlive
the peak_usb_device it points to on the probe error path?

peak_usb_set_mode(CAN_MODE_START) -> peak_usb_restart() ->
dev_restart_async() submits a URB with dev as its context, without
anchoring it. In pcan_usb_fd_restart_async():

	usb_fill_bulk_urb(urb, dev->udev,
			  usb_sndbulkpipe(dev->udev, fw_info->cmd_out_ep),
			  buf, pc - buf,
			  pcan_usb_pro_restart_complete, dev);

	/* and submit it. */
	return usb_submit_urb(urb, GFP_ATOMIC);

pcan_usb_pro_restart_async() does the same. pcan_usb.c passes pdev as the
context instead.

When peak_usb_probe() calls peak_usb_disconnect() after a probe failure,
the USB core has not disabled the interface. The commit message says so
too.

On that path, peak_usb_stop_rx() only poisons rx_submitted. Then
unregister_candev() -> peak_usb_ndo_stop() runs. There, close_candev()
only cancels restart_work, and peak_usb_unlink_all_urbs() only kills the
rx_submitted and tx_submitted anchors. Finally free_candev() frees the
netdev.

A restart URB can still be pending on the command endpoint, for example
if the device keeps NAKing it. Wouldn't its completion, when it finally
runs, do this on the freed netdev?

pcan_usb_pro_restart_complete()
    peak_usb_restart_complete(urb->context)
        dev->can.state = CAN_STATE_ERROR_ACTIVE;
        netif_wake_queue(dev->netdev);

The later commit "can: peak_usb: register the netdevs only once all
channels are set up" narrows the trigger. A later sibling's
register_candev() has to fail after channel 0 was registered, opened,
went bus-off and had a restart submitted. No patch in the series tracks
or kills restart URBs.
