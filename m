The upcoming DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_RESET flag will need to create an atomic
commit that brings the entire device back to a pristine state, as if
no configuration had ever been applied.

Create drm_atomic_commit_fill_with_defaults() which iterates over all
CRTCs, planes, connectors, and color operations in the device and
inserts a fresh default state for each one into the commit. This uses
the atomic_create_state() hooks rather than atomic_duplicate_state(),
since atomic_create_state() provides exactly this pristine state on a
per-object basis.

A lessee only gets the objects of its lease reset, the other ones
keeping their current state. Partial pipelines aren't supported
though: detaching a plane or a connector from its CRTC, and disabling
a CRTC driving them, both need the two sides in the commit, so a lease
that splits a pipeline is rejected with -ENOENT. validate_lease() is
expected to keep that from happening, since it requires a lease to
hold at least a CRTC, a connector and a plane, but it only looks at
the object types, not at what they are bound to.

Part of the state the atomic helpers maintain is only recomputed when
something changed, which a reset re-applying the same configuration
doesn't trigger. The CRTC adjusted_mode and the connector best_encoder
are therefore carried over like a duplicated state would, and the
CRTCs ask for a zpos normalization.

The color management changes are reported through color_mgmt_changed
for the same reason: the userspace property handlers only set it when
a property write changes the value stored in the new state, so neither
restoring a default nor leaving a property untouched would, even
though the reset clears whatever is currently programmed.

+ * drm_atomic_commit_fill_with_defaults - populate a commit with pristine states
+ * @file_priv: DRM file the reset was requested from, or NULL
+ * @commit: atomic commit to fill
+ *
+ * Iterate over all CRTCs, planes, connectors, and color operations in
+ * the device and insert a freshly created default state for each one
+ * into @commit. The states are created through the atomic_create_state()
+ * hooks, producing the same initial state the driver starts with rather
+ * than a copy of the current hardware state.
+ *
+ * In the default state, all objects are disabled: CRTCs are inactive,
+ * planes are disabled, and connectors are unbound. Driver-specific
+ * properties such as color pipeline settings or max_bpc may carry
+ * non-zero defaults appropriate for basic display output.
+ *
+ * If @file_priv is a lessee, only the CRTCs, planes and connectors part
+ * of its lease are reset, and the other objects keep their current
+ * state. @file_priv is optional: if NULL, it is considered to not hold
+ * any lease, and all objects are reset.
+ *
+ * Partial pipelines aren't supported. Resetting a plane or a connector
+ * detaches it from the CRTC it is bound to, and resetting a CRTC
+ * disables the planes and connectors bound to it, neither of which the
+ * atomic helpers can sort out with only one side of the pair in the
+ * commit. A lease covering a plane or a connector without the CRTC it
+ * is bound to, or a CRTC without all the planes and connectors bound
+ * to it, would thus require reaching outside of it, so the reset is
+ * rejected instead.
+ *
+ * Such a lease shouldn't exist in the first place: validate_lease()
+ * requires a lease to hold at least a CRTC, a connector and a plane,
+ * so leases are meant to describe whole pipelines. It only looks at
+ * the object types though, not at what they are bound to, so the
+ * reset still has to guard against it.
+ *
+ * This is meant to be used with the %DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_RESET flag, which
+ * needs to bring the device back to a known baseline before applying
+ * userspace property changes on top.
+ *
+ * Returns:
+ * 0 on success, -ENOENT if a leased plane or connector is bound to a
+ * CRTC that isn't leased, or a negative error code on failure.
