Was there a question here you missed ? FWIW:

I have expanded this to cover all 5 RmiFeatureRegisters exposed by RMM, 
and it looks something like this now, with the use of ARRAY_SIZE() to
limit accesses.

That is true. In this case, we should be able to proceed to
donate as much as we have been able to gather and retry
the donation in the next iteration, by freeing up the
cached ones.

We don't do partial free of the list today, and having that is
unnecssarily complicating the logic/code. We are going to do a reclaim 
anyways. Sure, I could add a comment.

We pass/get the out_regs, so local variable doesn't work, unless

Ack.  This was to handle a buggy RMM (and soothing an LLM bot)
