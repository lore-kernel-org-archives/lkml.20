Every peripheral should already contain a reference to all of the clocks
that are connected to it, and the peripheral drivers should request
those clocks. If you do that for all clocks a peripheral uses, you don't
need to have an artificial check for the gpios representing clocks
b,c,d,e,f,g... in the enable function for clock a, because their own
{devm,}clk_get_enabled() will interrogate the relevant bit.

At present, I'm expecting that you have a dt like

clk_gpio_locked: gpio-locked-fixed-clock {
    compatible =3D "gpio-locked-fixed-clock";
    #clock-cells =3D <0>;

    clocks =3D <&clk0 0>, <&pll 0>;

    locked-gpios =3D <&gpio0 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
            <&gpio0 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
            <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

    clock-output-names =3D "clkout0";
};

peripheral {
	clocks =3D <&clk_gpio_locked>, <&clk0 0>, <&pll 0>;
	//or this, depending on whether clkout0 actually produces a
	//rate, which I guess it does given it's a passthrough for the
	//first clocks entry?
	clocks =3D <&clk_gpio_locked>, <&pll 0>;
};

when really you should have something like

clk_gpio_locked: gpio-locked-fixed-clock {
    compatible =3D "gpio-locked-fixed-clock";
    #clock-cells =3D <1>;

    clocks =3D <&clk0 0>, <&pll 0>, <more clocks here>;

    locked-gpios =3D <&gpio0 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
            <&gpio0 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
            <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

    clock-output-names =3D "clkout0", "clkout1", "more clocks here";
};

peripheral {
	clocks =3D <&clk_gpio_locked 0>, <&clk_gpio_locked 1>;
};

Two reasons. Firstly because what you've got here suits you just fine,
but since you're adding it to a generic binding it should be written in
the most generic manner possible. Some other similar use case might not
want to wait for clocks used by other peripherals to lock before
allowing the driver for what they do care about to probe.
Secondly because it's a bit of a hack currently, you've got one clock
representing the status for a bunch of other clocks. Each clock should
represent it's own status. If this was done in the hardware it'd be one
thing, but you've got a pure software construct blocking one clock from
being locked because other clocks that may be unrelated to it entirely
are not yet locked.
The argument for including this depends on it not being a pure software
construct, and having what appears to be a hack so that you can rely on
the status of one clock rather than correctly determining the locked
state of individual clocks undermines your own argument for inclusion.

Cheers,
Conor.
