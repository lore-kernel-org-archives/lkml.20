This feels like I'm talking with an AI agent. Honestly, this is
rather discouraging.

So my short answer: I don't want to clutter the code just for some
weird behavior and my point stands: whats the use, if it's not
possible to unprotect that region. The intel-spi controller is
rather restrictive anyway.
