While I understand why you want it, I think that's maintenance burden
longer term. It's already touching about seven allocators (ITS,
dma-direct, CMA, atomic pool, swiotlb, restricted DMA pools, dma-buf).
Although most are in the DMA code, we still need to keep track of their
changes and what else may be coming. Can we even test all these
combinations in a CCA realm?

I assume for trusted devices we can skip this forced alignment.

TBH, I'm tempted not to support this configuration at all, just fail
gracefully if the realm page size doesn't match the host's. However, if
that's a real world configuration, I wonder whether could we leverage
the swiotlb mechanism but with a separate io_tlb_mem as a shared coco
allocator with the right alignment and use this pool when
force_dma_unencrypted() instead of specific alloc_pages() with adjusted
order.
