Yes the call tree you added above is correct. Here is an attempt at the
complete picture that I plan to include in the kernel-doc in v9:

 * Call Flow
 * ---------
 *
 * ::
 *
 *   # Driver initialization
 *   pci_liveupdate_register_flb(fh)
 *
 *   # Userspace: ioctl(LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD, devfd)
 *   luo_preserve_file()
 *     luo_flb_file_preserve()
 *       luo_flb_file_preserve_one()      # first preserved file only
 *         pci_flb_preserve()             # alloc and preserve struct pci_ser
 *     fh->ops->preserve()                # driver callback
 *       pci_liveupdate_preserve(dev)     # record this device in struct pci_ser
 *
 *   # Userspace: preservation cancelled or session torn down
 *   luo_file_unpreserve_files()
 *     luo_flb_file_unpreserve()
 *       liveupdate_flb_put_outgoing()    # last unpreserved file only
 *         pci_flb_unpreserve()           # free struct pci_ser
 *
 *   # ---------------- kexec ----------------
 *
 *   # New kernel: PCI enumeration
 *   pci_setup_device()
 *     pci_liveupdate_setup_device()
 *       liveupdate_flb_get_incoming()
 *         luo_flb_retrieve_one()         # first request only
 *           pci_flb_retrieve()           # previous kernel's struct pci_ser
 *
 *   # Userspace: ioctl(LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_FINISH)
 *   luo_file_finish_one()
 *     fh->ops->finish()                  # driver callback
 *       pci_liveupdate_finish(dev)       # release this device's pci_dev_ser
 *     luo_flb_file_finish()
 *       liveupdate_flb_put_incoming()    # last incoming file only
 *         pci_flb_finish()               # free struct pci_ser
 *

And here is an updated commit message that I hope explains everything more
clearly:

 PCI: liveupdate: Set up FLB handler for the PCI core

 Set up a File-Lifecycle-Bound (FLB) handler so that the PCI core can
 preserve its own state across a Live Update kexec.

 Preserving a PCI device across kexec requires preserving two independent
 sets of state:

  - Driver state, e.g. everything vfio-pci needs so that userspace can
    keep using the device in the new kernel. The driver preserves this
    itself and the PCI core is not involved.

  - PCI core state, e.g. which devices are preserved, so that the new
    kernel knows not to disturb them while they are still running and
    doing DMA. That is what this commit adds, serialized into struct
    pci_ser.

 Userspace, not the kernel, decides which devices are preserved, and it
 does so through the Live Update Orchestrator's (LUO) support for file
 preservation: a driver exposes a file that represents a single PCI
 device, and userspace preserves that device with
 ioctl(LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD) on that file. Binding preservation
 to a file gives it proper lifecycle management, e.g. the preservation is
 undone if userspace cancels it or goes away. How a driver exposes that
 file is up to the driver and invisible to the PCI core (vfio-pci variant
 drivers, the first intended use-case, use their per-device cdev).

 LUO only knows that a file was preserved; it does not know that the
 represents a PCI device, or which one. Bridging that gap, drivers
 register their liveupdate_file_handler with the PCI core:

   pci_liveupdate_register_flb(driver_file_handler);
   pci_liveupdate_unregister_flb(driver_file_handler);

 LUO then refcounts the PCI core's FLB against the files preserved by
 that handler, and that refcount drives the lifetime of struct pci_ser:

  - On the first preserved file, luo_flb_file_preserve_one() calls
    pci_flb_preserve(), which allocates struct pci_ser and preserves it
    with KHO.

  - On the last unpreserved file (i.e. preservation cancelled),
    liveupdate_flb_put_outgoing() calls pci_flb_unpreserve(), which
    unpreserves and frees struct pci_ser.

  - In the next kernel, pci_flb_retrieve() hands the PCI core the struct
    pci_ser built by the previous kernel, whenever the PCI core asks for
    it (e.g. during enumeration), and pci_flb_finish() frees it once the
    PCI core is done with it.

 So the flow for preserving a device, once a driver has registered, looks
 like this:

   ioctl(LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD)
     luo_session_preserve_fd()
       luo_preserve_file()
         luo_flb_file_preserve()
           luo_flb_file_preserve_one()  # only on the first preserved file
             pci_flb_preserve()         # alloc + KHO-preserve pci_ser
         fh->ops->preserve()            # driver callback, e.g. vfio-pci

 Note that struct pci_ser is deliberately not allocated when a driver
 calls pci_liveupdate_register_flb(). A driver can be loaded for the
 lifetime of the machine without ever preserving a device, and there is
 no reason to allocate memory and hand it to the next kernel in that
 case. Letting LUO own the lifetime also means the PCI core does not have
 to duplicate LUO's refcounting and unwind logic for preservation
 failures, session aborts and fd close, and the incoming side
 (retrieve/finish) comes from the same object rather than requiring a
 separate KHO FDT entry owned by the PCI core.

 Note: This commit only allocates struct pci_ser and preserves it across
 Live Update. A subsequent commit adds pci_liveupdate_preserve(), the API
 drivers call from their fh->ops->preserve() callback to tell the PCI
 core exactly which devices are being preserved.

 Note: There is no reason to check for kho_is_enabled() since it can be
 assumed to return true. If KHO was not enabled then Live Update would
 not be enabled and these routines would never run.
