Hey Linus,

/* Summary */

This stops TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL from interrupting work that can't be
restarted and fixes a bunch of coredump and signal bugs.

TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL kicks a task out of an uninterruptible sleep so it
returns to userspace, runs its task work and goes back to sleep. That
breaks coredumps. dump_interrupted() only lets fatal signals interrupt
a dump and writes to a regular file ignore TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL. But the
pipe and the socket paths check signal_pending() deep down in code that
is shared with regular syscalls and bail. So a crashing process with
io_uring requests in flight loses most of its coredump. In the selftest
an unfixed kernel delivers 357324 of at least 5111808 bytes. And
io_uring isn't the only source. klp_send_signals(),
bpf_task_work_schedule_signal(), landlock's tsync, kthread_stop() and
the printk kunit test raise the bit as well, some of them from irq
context against any task. So this can't be fixed per subsystem and the
state has to be per-task and ambient.

Add PF_NO_NOTIFY_SIGNAL and no_notify_signal_save()/restore() helpers
modelled on memalloc_nofs_save(). Inside such a section
signal_pending() ignores TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL. Coredumps, the smb send
path, which hand-rolled its own version of this, and the pid namespace
reaper, which busy-looped when the bit kept getting raised, are
converted.

The second part is a set of fixes that fell out of looking at the
coredump code with kres and modelling it in TLA+:

- coredump_finish() woke the parked threads without holding rcu. A
  parked thread can exit on a spurious wakeup and be freed before
  wake_up_process() takes its pi_lock.

- Only SIGKILL and the freezers interrupt a dump now and the three
  freezers agree. Power management and cgroup v1 freezing aborted a
  dump while a cgroup v2 freeze either waited for the dump or cut it
  short depending on where the core went.

- io-wq set its exit bit without a barrier against the task work that
  creates workers. On weakly ordered architectures exit could hang on
  worker_done.

- retarget_shared_pending() slingshotted a shared signal to the dumper
  when a zapped sibling restored its signal mask. That set
  TIF_SIGPENDING on the dumper and truncated the core.

- A tracer could clear the signal mask of a user worker with
  PTRACE_SETSIGMASK and inject a coredump signal. An io-wq worker of an
  SQPOLL ring dumping core deadlocks the whole group. PTRACE_SETSIGMASK
  is refused for user workers now and __set_task_blocked() enforces the
  fork-time mask.

- exec cancels io_uring requests before de_thread() so a worker
  creation queued as task work can't add a thread to a thread group
  that de_thread() just took down.

- No io threads are created from a PF_SIGNALED or PF_POSTCOREDUMP
  creator anymore. Such a worker was invisible to zap_process() but
  still decremented threads_remaining on exit so the dumper could leave
  coredump_wait_inactive() early.

Also included are a comment that do_each_pid_task() needs
tasklist_lock, a READ_ONCE() in pid_alive() and a regression test for
fork() into a pid namespace whose ancestor lost its init.

Merge conflicts with mainline

Merge conflicts with other trees
================================

This conflicts with the cifs tree in fs/smb/client/transport.c between
commit 80f49404968d6 ("smb: client: fast fail sends if need to
reconnect") from the cifs tree and commit d0ae35565f5d5 ("smb: prevent
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL from interrupting") from this tree. The cifs tree
bails out early after sock_sendmsg() when a reconnect is needed and
this tree wraps the call in a no_notify_signal guard and drops the
EINTR special case below it:
