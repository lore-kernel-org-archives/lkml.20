/sys/devices/platform/ contains platform devices that were created
without parents.  MSFT1000:00 has a parent, so it is not there.

Yes, you are, and this is the platform device I'm talking about.  The
firmware_node symbolic link under it should point to
/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/ACPI0004:00/MSFT1000:00/.

The idea is that the objects under /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/
correspond to nodes in the ACPI namespace and they may or may not
correspond to physical pieces of hardware.  They are referred to as
"ACPI devices", but in fact they represent platform firmware
interfaces that can be associated with devices - that's where the
firmware_node and physical_node symlinks come into play.

Accordingly, adding children that do not correspond to nodes in the
ACPI namespace is confusing and generally questionable.  Children
should be added under devices pointed to by their physical_node
symlinks.

Yes, that's as expected, thanks for checking!

I'll send a new version of the $subject patch based on this observation.
