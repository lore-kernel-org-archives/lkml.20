You're right, using "cleanup" glosses over important fixes.  It's a
significant consistency problem for PCI core ASPM code as well as
racing.

Although I'm not sure there is actually a race between the driver and
the PCI core *except* for sysfs.  In what non-sysfs case might the
core ASPM code touch the device at the same time as the driver?  I
guess maybe lane margining and bwctrl?  Can those happen autonomously,
without being kicked via sysfs?

Absolutely!
