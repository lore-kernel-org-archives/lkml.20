As an update: I had a discussion with the hardware team about this.  My 
understanding so far is that this is by design, i.e., referencing the 
backing page by GPA (as against using an SPA) was intentional for 
specific micro-architectural reasons and the #NPF issue is a side-effect 
of that.

Great!

Nice, this has been the one path that I have been able to trigger a non 
restartable #NPF reliably in my testing so far. So, this will be 
definitely needed and I suppose this will imply a dependency on in-place 
conversion.

I suppose this is one of the bigger concerns (next to ensuring all 
invalidation paths are covered). If I'm reading this right, I think your 
idea (thanks!) to skip zap'ing SPTEs for attribute updates addresses 
this path:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/ao9CKMXAX-hScRSa@google.com/

In fact, as far as I can tell, it likely also addresses the MMU Notifier 
path independently.

I believe the other larger concern was ensuring coverage so that there 
aren't surprises in a production deployment. I was thinking if a check 
for the Secure AVIC backing page GPA in sev_gmem_invalidate_range() 
(with a subsequent kvm_vm_dead() or such on a match) can serve as a way 
to ensure we aren't missing any paths, and to guard against future 
changes.

For hugepages, the intent is to split as part of the Secure AVIC NAE 
Event for backing page registration. i.e., PSMASH()+prefault at the time 
of registration. And since there is no PUNSMASH(), the backing page 
should never end up as part of a hugepage again.
