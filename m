Ugh, I feel that I always to go the code from beginning to check these
up but those workarounds are still valid i.e., these patches do not
address write divergence.

I would summarize my fixes along the lines of:

1. 1/2 exactly removes cred creation as a side-effect invisible to the
   caller..
2. 2/2 handles request_key()'s from nfsd and other in-kernel daemons.
   I.e. it transforms BUG_ON() into -EPERM.

I'd like to keep this patch set strictly within scope and somewhat
surgical if/when it is applied.

And it looks to me a lot that this might well be the smallest possible
change that addresses exactly unwanted BUG_ON() conditions pointed out
by Jann surpsingly well.
