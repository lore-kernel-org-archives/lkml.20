Does write_file() report buffered flush failures? It sets ret = 0
before fclose() and then discards fclose()'s return value, so if the
final flush fails (for example, ENOSPC when writing the 32 MiB file
into /tmp), the function still returns 0.

The truncated file is caught later by read_file()'s st_size check, but
the child exits with CHILD_EXIT_READ_FILE instead of
CHILD_EXIT_WRITE_FILE, so child_exit_str() reports "read data file"
for what was really a write failure. The per-step exit codes added by
this patch exist precisely to pin down which step failed.

Can this test distinguish a BPF program that implements the
CSS_DYING/CSS_ONLINE check from one that does not?

The commit message says "Looking the target up by id is not enough:
bpf_cgroup_from_id() keeps handing back a cgroup until its last
reference is dropped, so the program checks the css flags and skips
reclaim once the target is offlined or dying", and the comment above
this test says it "verifies that reclaim stops on the removed target
instead of reclaiming from it".

But bpf_cgroup_from_id() does not keep handing back the cgroup after
rmdir. The lookup sequence is:

  bpf_cgroup_from_id()
    -> cgroup_get_from_id()
      -> __cgroup_get_from_id() in kernel/cgroup/cgroup.c
        -> kernfs_find_and_get_node_by_id()

kernfs_find_and_get_node_by_id() in fs/kernfs/dir.c fails on an
inactive node:

    if (unlikely(!__kernfs_active(kn) || !atomic_inc_not_zero(&kn->count)))
        goto err_unlock;

cgroup_destroy_locked() runs synchronously inside the rmdir syscall and
calls kernfs_remove(cgrp->kn) before it returns. By the time
remove_cgroup(CG_DYING_TARGET_DIR) at line 635 returns, every subsequent
reclaim round takes the get_cgroup_memcg_from_id() failure path in
progs/memcg_async_reclaim.c:132, bumping reclaim_target_gone and leaving
reclaim_calls / reclaimed_bytes frozen.

That happens whether or not cgroup_is_dying() exists in the program.
reclaim_skipped_dying is only reachable through a sub-microsecond race
in reclaim_cgroup() where the reference is acquired before rmdir but the
flags are read after, and the deliberate usleep(DYING_SETTLE_US) = 200
ms at line 638, placed before the calls_before/bytes_before snapshot,
makes even that window essentially unobservable.

So the break condition at lines 645-647 and all three assertions (lines
651-657, 670, 672) are satisfied by the lookup-failure path alone.
Deleting cgroup_is_dying() from the BPF program would not make this test
fail.

To actually exercise the dying window the test would have to keep the
target cgroup pinned so that bpf_cgroup_from_id() still resolves it
while it is offline (for example, hold a cgroup fd or a task in it, or
drive the removal concurrently with reclaim without the 200 ms settle)
and then assert on reclaim_skipped_dying specifically rather than on the
OR of the two counters.

Does the (flags & CSS_DYING) term ever fire?

CSS_DYING is never set on cgrp->self. The only assignment in the tree is
css->flags |= CSS_DYING in kill_css_sync() at kernel/cgroup/cgroup.c:6147.
kill_css_sync() has exactly two callers, and both pass a subsystem css,
never the cgroup's own self css:

  - cgroup_destroy_locked() calls it under for_each_css(css, ssid, cgrp),
    and that macro only ever yields cgrp->subsys[ssid].
  - cgroup_apply_control_disable() calls it with css = cgroup_css(dsct, ss)
    where ss comes from for_each_subsys(), so again dsct->subsys[ss->id].

kill_css_sync() also unconditionally dereferences css->ss->css_killed,
which would NULL-deref for &cgrp->self whose ss is NULL. So cgrp->self.flags
& CSS_DYING is always 0 and cgroup_is_dying() reduces to cgroup_is_dead().

Also, the comment above the helper claims bpf_cgroup_from_id() keeps
handing back the cgroup until the last reference is dropped. That is not
what the lookup does. bpf_cgroup_from_id() -> cgroup_get_from_id() ->
__cgroup_get_from_id() is kernfs_find_and_get_node_by_id() followed by
cgroup_tryget(). It starts failing as soon as cgroup_destroy_locked()
reaches kernfs_remove(cgrp->kn) or percpu_ref_kill(&cgrp->self.refcnt),
both long before the last reference is dropped. The window in which the
surviving !CSS_ONLINE check can still observe a cgroup is between
cgrp->self.flags &= ~CSS_ONLINE and kernfs_remove() a few statements
later, all under cgroup_mutex.

The comment at line 112 also states "vmlinux.h is generated from the
running kernel's BTF". tools/testing/selftests/bpf/vmlinux.h is generated
at build time from $(VMLINUX_BTF), which for a cross-built or packaged
selftest is not necessarily the kernel the test runs on.

Does RECLAIM_MAX_ITER actually bound an iteration count?

The macro is only ever used as a byte multiplier:

  elem->remaining = RECLAIM_MAX_ITER * RECLAIM_SIZE = 32 * 128 KiB = 4 MiB

and the requeue loop is bounded by bytes actually reclaimed, not by
callback count. bpf_proactive_reclaim() returns the bytes that
try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages() actually freed, which is frequently less
than the requested 128 KiB. A single page (4 KiB) is enough to keep the
round alive, so a round in which each pass frees one page needs 4 MiB /
4 KiB = 1024 callbacks, i.e. 32x more than the name and the file header
comment suggest.

Total work per round is still bounded at 4 MiB and each individual
callback is still one bounded pass, so there is no runaway. The defect
is that the documented iteration bound does not exist, which makes the
requeue budget hard to reason about.
