I agree with you (but that's what we do for ACPI autodep and AFAICS OF
devlinks - though there there might be opt-outs).

To make -EPROBE_DEFER work I have to pursue the approach undertaken in this
set and apply requested changes - I don't see any other way.

Are we willing to accept the approach taken in this patchset (I can remove
software nodes and make the whole thing ACPI static nodes self-contained) ?

One way or another this ought to be sorted, please all let me know your
take on this.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
