Perhaps I was thinking of scenarios with moderate to high load, such as cloud
computing or server environments. In such cases, there may be few opportunities
for successful migration - for example, because it would only put additional
pressure on an already heavily loaded CPU - and even lock contention could
become a bottleneck. Of course, this is just speculation on my part.

I have an idea worth discussing. For example, the push could be added to
sched_balance_softirq or a similar new softirq/interrupt context. This would
avoid issues such as inconsistent load-balancing intervals and EAS being
disabled. For instance, the push could be triggered when the current CPU's load
exceeds a certain threshold or when the CPU is not running purely CFS tasks.

Going forward, I will continue to follow your code and the CAS code, and I hope
I can contribute in some small way.

I'll step away for the weekend and circle back to this next week.
