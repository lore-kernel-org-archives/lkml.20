Of course, it should never depend on how quickly userspace drains the ring.
My point is that reserved entries is not the only option that satisfies 
that.

Return -EINVAL meaning what? userspace can't set the dirty-ring to 4k? that 
could break a lot of users.

Disabling HDBSS for that range could be the solution, but then we 
would have HDBSS being used for dirty-rings above some size, which could be 
kind of odd in the code, and possibly lead to trouble in the future.

That's one of the reasons I mentioned reserved entries may not be the best 
solution for us.

Thanks!
