This is a lot in one patch.  Can we break some of this
up into smaller changes?  The whole thing is probably
to complex for a stable tag, so focus on the most broken
aspects.

This I'd like in a patch that does just this and allows the commit
message to say why simply using a single lock for the data buffers
would not be cleaner.

Complicated sounding solution. Can we claim buffered mode instead?
That would ensure the update_scan_mode and this don't race and mostly
would be taking an uncontended lock.

If we get a timeout, we'd not normally worry too much on old data
on the next read. It's an error case that isn't supposed to happen so
if we are talking stale data that is often considered fine. The
second part may make sense - break that out as a separate patch
so we can easily analyse it on its own.

This is fine but not burred in this giant fix patch.

This one seems valid.

With all the above in mind, I'm not going to spend the time
to unpick the different fixes today but look forward to them
as 5ish individual fix patches.

Thanks,

Jonathan
