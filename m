Having to context-switch back to this later would probably be harder

I was busy all the time there though, so I guess no regrets at least
from that standpoint.

No, it is not a full solution for this kind of a problem.

Well, that was just the first example I could think about while

Interesting thought, and hold on to it.

Let me start with a clear problem statement to kind of refresh the context.

In some cases, there are unwanted parent suspends occurring between
child suspend and resume that delay the latter unnecessarily and
generally waste energy.  They mostly occur when the child suspends and
resumes relatively often and the parent's autosuspend delay is too
short to cover the entire period between the child suspend and resume
along with the preceding period of the child activity following the
most recent update of the parent's last_busy timestamp, at least
sometimes.

Of course, this also equally applies to suppliers and consumers, but
let's focus the attention on parents and children.

The problem addressed by

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/commit/=
?h=3Dlinux-next&id=3D55b2b8af704f845e01fa2f31ee259b07641ce3a9

makes the unwanted parent suppends to occur more often because it
causes the parent to entirely miss its last_busy updates in the cases
when pm_runtime_resume() (or equivalent) is called for it when it is
active.  When this goes away, it should be possible to address those
"unwanted parent suspends" at least in some cases by increasing the
parent's autosuspend delay.  However, using larger autosuspend delay
values generally causes system power to grow (on average) because it
effectively causes devices to spend less time in suspend, so
increasing autosuspend delay values is not a particularly attractive
option.

Notice though that advancing the last_busy timestamp more often
without reducing the autosuspend delay values of the affected devices
is also likely to lead to the overall increase of system power because
it would effectively cause the devices to spend less time in suspend
(on average) likely increasing their power (unless the majority of
their suspends are unwanted).

Now, let me acknowledge that some drivers evidently want rpm_idle() to
always set the autosuspend timer instead of suspending the device
right away.  That may be because of the "unwanted parent suspends"
problem at hand or for other reasons.  Regardless, it is effectively
equivalent to setting last_busy in rpm_idle(), so they use their
.runtime_idle() callbacks for calling pm_runtime_mark_last_busy().  It
arguably would be nice to allow them to just declare that, for example
by introducing something like pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() to
be called instead of pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() if the driver wants
rpm_idle() to always set the autosuspend timer instead of attempting
to suspend the device directly.

I think that using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always(), if it existed,
might be attractive for a couple of reasons.  First off, which is
rather obvious, a driver using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always()
wouldn't need to worry about last_busy at all, so it would never need
to call pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() or pm_runtime_put_autosuspend().
It would just need to call pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() once
and set the autosuspend delay (which may even be combined with the
former).  Second, the autosuspend delay of a driver using
pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() would only need to cover the
period after the last runtime PM reference to the given device had
been dropped while currently an autosuspend delay needs to cover that
period along with some (usually unknown) period of device activity
between the most recent last_busy update and the time when rpm_idle()
gets called.  Thus, with pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always(), the
autosuspend delay usage would be arguably more straightforward and
easier to reason about, and also the autosuspend delay might be
reduced in the majority of cases.

Of course, drivers that have the "unwanted parent suspends" problem
might switch over to using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() and
adjust their autosuspend delay values to cover full periods of their
children's suspension.  In theory, it should be possible to reduce
their autosuspend delay values while at it, for reasons explained
above, so the total average system power might even remain unchanged
at least roughly.  That overall might be a zero-overhead change.

Using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() would also make autosuspend
work consistently in all situations regardless of the reason why the
last runtime PM reference to the given device had been dropped,
including the "power/control" manipulations from user space, in which
case it would be equivalent to calling pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() in
the sysfs code path mentioned by you above.

Moreover, suppose that pm_runtime_use_autosuspend_always() turns out
to work for everybody, regardless of whether or not they have the
"unwanted parent suspends" problem.  In that case, it will be possible
to simplify the whole autosuspend delay handling quite a bit.
