Hello Kairui

Right. My thought is to remove the priority semantics within a tier.

Once devices are grouped into the same tier, allocation within that tier
should be handled by a tier-specific allocation policy.

If users want the traditional priority-based behavior, I think they should
assign devices to different tiers and manage them that way.

For swap devices assigned to the same tier, we can still leave the behavior
flexible through the interfac(they may be treated equally, or priority may
still be considered). However, there should be a default allocation policy.

Yeah right. will consider regession case.
