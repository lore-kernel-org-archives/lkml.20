I don't have a strong opinion on the way forward here.
Mark, any thoughts on what is going to work best long term for SPI?

I'm nervous that we might wall ourselves into a corner if not
careful about bindings. That is less of a concern for in kernel
interfaces which probably won't be that widely used.
