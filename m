I did read the cover-letter and I got the arguments from Benjamin, and
while in theory it could indeed solve the issue described, in reality
it won't for the reasons I exposed.

And since it's basically allowing to accept out-of-tree downstream
driver instead of upstreaming, I'm kind against TBH.

But I'm open to discussion, and I'll talk about display Panel in
XDC today, Plumbers and ELC next week so I hope we'll find time to
discuss about this in person!
