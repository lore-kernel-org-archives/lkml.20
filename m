On a second thought, I agree with you. Not only is the completion timeout much longer
than the usual sample period, but also, in the event of a timeout (and no counters being
copied back to UM), I don't think a perfcnt user would care much about the reset state.

I'll leave dealing with the problem of synchronisation between reset and the IRQ
handlers to a later patch series, so in the meantime, SESSION_INTERRUPTED_BY_RESET
should always lead to EAGAIN being returned.
