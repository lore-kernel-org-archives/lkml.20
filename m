Yes. It might just be a notification from ACPI core to say "the driver for
this ACPI device probed, go create platform devices that depends on it".

We can check and track the dependency in code that does create those
devices today.

I will think about this to see how bad this might look like.

Yes that's the problem, reworking the code to make it work with namespace
devices is doable the issue is existing firmware and that we can't change it
(and we can't create it in the kernel either).

Thanks,
