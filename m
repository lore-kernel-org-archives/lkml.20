EL2 owns a protected vCPU's state once it has run, and the ioctls that
would access it fail rather than silently operate on a copy that is not
the guest's. Describe the resulting API in pkvm.rst, point api.rst at
it from each ioctl that behaves differently, and note the errnos beside
the PVTIME attribute in devices/vcpu.rst and the PSCI version register
in fw-pseudo-registers.rst.

No functional change intended.

 Protected VM firmware (pvmfw)
 -----------------------------
 
 Status: **Unimplemented.**
 
+API behaviour for protected VMs
+===============================
+
+Protected vCPU state is owned by EL2 (see `CPU state isolation`_). The VMM
+configures a vCPU before its first ``KVM_RUN``; afterwards the state is
+private to the guest and the ioctls that access it return ``-EPERM``. The
+errors follow one rule: ``-EPERM`` means the host asked for state that the
+guest owns, and ``-EINVAL`` means the request is not valid for a protected
+VM. The ioctls themselves are described in Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst.
+
+Boot
+----
+
+A protected VM boots from a single primary vCPU. Before the first
+``KVM_RUN``, the VMM prepares the boot state:
+
+* Set ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` on the primary vCPU and
+  ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` on every other vCPU. EL2 allows only one
+  RUNNABLE primary per protected VM. A second RUNNABLE vCPU fails at its
+  first ``KVM_RUN``.
+* Set the primary vCPU's boot state with ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG``: the kernel
+  entry address in ``PC`` and the DTB pointer in ``x0``.
+
+``PC`` and ``x0`` are the only registers EL2 takes from the host. Other
+pre-run writes are accepted, but the guest starts from the architectural
+reset values.
+
+Secondary vCPUs are started by the guest itself through PSCI ``CPU_ON``
+(see `Power state`_), which supplies their entry point and context ID.
+The VMM cannot choose where they boot.
+
+vCPU state
+----------
+
+* ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` and ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` return ``-EPERM`` once the
+  vCPU has run. Before that, they access the host-side copy from which
+  EL2 builds the guest's boot state (see `Boot`_).
+* ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` accepts only the vCPU features that a protected
+  guest supports and returns ``-EINVAL`` otherwise.
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PSCI_0_2`` is required, as EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for
+  the guest (see `Power state`_). ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT`` is not
+  supported: protected guests run in AArch64 only and see no AArch32
+  support in ``ID_AA64PFR0_EL1``. Once the vCPU has run,
+  ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT`` returns ``-EPERM``, as re-initialising it would
+  reset the host-side copy alone.
+* ``KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS`` returns ``-EPERM`` for external-abort injection
+  (``ext_dabt_pending``). SError injection is unaffected.
+* ``KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG`` returns ``-EPERM`` (see `Debug`_).
+
+Power state
+-----------
+
+EL2 implements PSCI 1.1 for a protected guest. The calls that move a
+vCPU's power state, ``CPU_ON``, ``CPU_OFF`` and ``AFFINITY_INFO``, are
+handled at EL2, and the host cannot change the outcome: for ``CPU_ON``
+the host only schedules the target, which EL2 has already reset to the
+entry point the guest chose, and for ``CPU_OFF`` it only stops
+scheduling it. A vCPU becomes a valid ``CPU_ON`` target at its first
+``KVM_RUN``, and before that EL2 returns ``INVALID_PARAMETERS``. The
+platform calls, ``CPU_SUSPEND``, ``SYSTEM_OFF``, ``SYSTEM_RESET`` and
+``SYSTEM_RESET2``, are forwarded to the host and behave as for a
+non-protected VM, with the ``SYSTEM_*`` calls exiting to the VMM as
+``KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT``; the ``SYSTEM_RESET2`` reset type and cookie
+are in the guest's registers, which ``KVM_GET_ONE_REG`` rejects once
+the vCPU has run. Any other function returns ``NOT_SUPPORTED``, and
+``PSCI_FEATURES`` reports the same set. Because the host handles those
+forwarded calls, ``KVM_SET_ONE_REG`` on ``KVM_REG_ARM_PSCI_VERSION``
+returns ``-EINVAL`` for a version below 1.1.
+
+Once a vCPU has run, its power state follows the guest's PSCI calls, not
+the VMM's. ``KVM_SET_MP_STATE`` with ``KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED`` still stops
+the vCPU, so the VMM can pause it. ``KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`` and
+``KVM_MP_STATE_SUSPENDED`` return ``-EPERM`` for a vCPU that the guest has
+powered off with ``CPU_OFF``, or has not yet brought online with ``CPU_ON``:
+only an in-guest ``CPU_ON`` can power it on.
+
+Other interface differences
+---------------------------
+
+* ``KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION`` reports only the capabilities that pKVM supports
+  for protected guests, and ``KVM_ENABLE_CAP`` accepts only those. Query
+  them on the VM file descriptor: the system file descriptor has no VM to
+  filter against. The filter does not cover every interface either:
+  device-fd configuration (for example the VGIC after
+  ``KVM_CREATE_DEVICE``) and vCPU attributes are unfiltered, and can refuse
+  what a capability reported as available. ``KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL``
+  returns ``-EPERM``, for example, since steal time cannot work for a
+  protected guest.
+* The vGIC of a protected VM remains host-managed: device creation,
+  configuration and interrupt injection all work as they do for a
+  non-protected VM.
+* ``KVM_ARM_SET_COUNTER_OFFSET`` and ``KVM_ARM_GET_REG_WRITABLE_MASKS``
+  return ``-EINVAL``: their capabilities are not offered to a protected
+  VM, whose counter offset and ID registers are set by EL2. A protected
+  guest sees the physical timebase.
+* A protected guest's first access to each page of memory exits to the
+  host, since the hypervisor cannot tell memory from a device before the
+  page is mapped. For a store, the host sees the value of the register
+  the syndrome names, clamped to the access width, and nothing else from
+  the register file.
+* A protected guest that uses a feature it was not given, or executes an
+  ``SMC``, takes an undefined instruction exception from the hypervisor;
+  the host is not involved.
+* The hypervisor handles a protected guest's SMCCC calls itself and does
+  not involve the host. A function it does not implement returns
+  ``NOT_SUPPORTED``.
+* The hypervisor can decode a trapped guest access only from the CPU's
+  instruction syndrome, which is provided only for a load or store of a
+  single general-purpose register. An access without one (for example a
+  load/store pair or a SIMD/FP access) cannot be decoded. For a
+  non-protected VM it can exit to the VMM as ``KVM_EXIT_ARM_NISV``. For a
+  protected VM it cannot be emulated by the VMM, so the guest takes a
+  synchronous external abort instead.
+
+Debug
+-----
+
+Hardware-assisted debugging is not available to protected guests: their
+debug registers are RAZ/WI.
