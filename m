I didn't even get as far as sd modulators or whatever, if I understand
correctly the ADC inputs on this device are fed by the onboard ADC?
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/20261006-adc-stm32mp25-v1-v4-0-d31ec75ae=
cf3@foss.st.com/)
In that case, I can't really see how it makes sense for the primary iio
device to change when data is fed back through the mdf or taken
directly from the ADC itself, particularly given how that would affect
the userspace interface.

The "serial" side of this seems in a similar vein to the adi,axi-adc
stuff, which when considered with the ADC inputs, really does give me
the impression this is backwards.
