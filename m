I don't see a reason for 1.  The bios has to have provided a CFMWS that will
work or option 2 will fail - if it supports hotplug or indeed doesn't want =
to
do config of devices on cold plug it just provides 'enough space'.  Whether=
 it
does that by hard coded big number, bios menu option or otherwise doesn't
matter to us.

But in general a driver should bind before we create anything (assuming we
are in a host OS managed flow).  Why would we want to do anything before th=
at
as we have no idea if a driver will ever bind - or if there is flexibility
in size exposed that can't be known until driver bind.

Given it is potentially a contended resource, we may need a way to clamp
the maximum a particular instances is allowed to request. For now maybe
first come, first served is good enough? No idea.=20
