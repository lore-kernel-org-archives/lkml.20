Actually, by stop I meant SOFT_RESET, which shutdowns the power rails
automatically. This makes me realize this commit message is
out-of-date, because we now rely on the fact SOFT_RESET is considered
non-fallible to keep things simple.

PM refs can always still be released with pm_runtime_put[_sync()] after
that point. All pm_runtime_disable() does is skip the call to the RPM
hooks, which is exactly what we want, because we're going to suspend
things manually.

Oops, indeed.

Hm, that's a valid point. We probably need to stop the VM_BIND
queue in vm_destroy() instead of vm_cleanup().

Because this can be executed during an unplug, and the
pm_runtime_disable() we added in panthor_device_unplug() makes it
so panthor_device_resume_and_get() can now return an error that's
expected. If we really wanted to keep that WARN_ON() we'd need to
distinguish error-because-its-disabled vs
error-returned-by-the-resume-hook, and I thought it wasn't worth it.
But I can find a solution to make that work if you think it's important.

It's the group_term_work that's supposed to stop the queues and cancel
all remaining jobs, and we queue this work for all bound, idle and
runnable groups that remain at unplug time. We also make sure those are
executed with a flush_workqueue(sched->wq). So, unlike the VM_BIND
queue which is really lacking this vm_term_work step to cancel jobs and
finish the drm_sched objects, I think the group side of things is sound.

Probably not, I'll drop it.
