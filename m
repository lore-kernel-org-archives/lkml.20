+=============================
+Sleeping lock holder tracking
+=============================
+
+:Date: September 2026
+:Author: Shakeel Butt <shakeel.butt@linux.dev>
+
+Why
+===
+
+A task that stalls while holding a widely shared lock also stalls the
+tasks waiting for that lock. Some kernel code wants to avoid stalling
+such a task.
+
+One source of such stalls is a memory allocation by the lock holder,
+which can get stuck in memory reclaim because the system is low on
+memory or because a memcg limit is being enforced. If an allocation made
+while holding ``cgroup_mutex`` or ``kernfs_rwsem`` gets stuck in reclaim,
+other cgroupfs operations can end up waiting too, even for unrelated
+cgroups.
+
+Knowing that the task holds such a lock lets the allocation path treat it
+differently. Under a memcg limit it can skip the throttling that
+enforcement would otherwise do inline, and leave it for the return to
+user space. Under global pressure it can let the allocation reach the
+memory reserves, so it finishes instead of waiting for reclaim. Those
+policies are not part of this feature; they only need the answer.
+
+What
+====
+
+Locks do not record all their holders, so the answer comes from the task
+instead. Each task counts the opted-in locks it holds::
+
+	static inline bool task_holds_tracked_lock(struct task_struct *p);
+	static inline bool current_holds_tracked_lock(void);
+	static inline unsigned int task_nr_tracked_locks(struct task_struct *p);
+
+Only the task itself changes its count, so the count needs no atomics or
+locking. Without ``CONFIG_TRACK_LOCK_HOLDERS``, these always return
+``false`` or ``0``.
+
+BPF programs can read ``task->nr_tracked_locks`` through BTF.
+
+Opting a lock in
+================
+
+No lock is tracked by default. A lock opts in right after it is
+initialized::
+
+	init_rwsem(&root->kernfs_rwsem);
+	rwsem_track_holder(&root->kernfs_rwsem);
+
+	mutex_init(&foo->lock);
+	mutex_track_holder(&foo->lock);
+
+	percpu_init_rwsem(&foo->sem);
+	percpu_rwsem_track_holder(&foo->sem);
+
+Only a few locks should opt in: those whose holders can stall unrelated
+work. A lock must opt in before anyone can take it. A task already
+holding it was not counted, so its release would make its count wrong.
+All three helpers warn and do nothing if the lock is held. Initializing
+a lock again clears its opt-in.
+
+A tracked rw_semaphore must not use ``down_read_non_owner()`` or
+``up_read_non_owner()``, which can run in different tasks.
+``down_read_non_owner()`` warns on a tracked rwsem and does not count it.
+
+A percpu_rw_semaphore can be passed to another task with
+``percpu_rwsem_release()`` and ``percpu_rwsem_acquire()``, as filesystem
+freeze does. The count moves with the lock.
+
+Cost
+====
+
+With ``CONFIG_TRACK_LOCK_HOLDERS=n``, the generated code does not change.
+
+With it enabled, no lock type grows on 64-bit, so neither do the
+structures that embed them. That relies on padding which is not there on
+every configuration: see the end of this section.
+
+A mutex and an rw_semaphore keep the opt-in in a spare bit of a word they
+already have: bit 3 of ``rw_semaphore::count``, which is reserved, and
+bit 3 of ``mutex::owner``, which is below the alignment of a task_struct
+pointer. The bit is sticky, so unlike the other flag bits it survives
+unlock, and an unlocked lock that has opted in does not read as zero.
+Paths that add to these words, or write back a value they read, keep the
+bit as they are. The three that write an absolute value -
+``rwsem_write_trylock()``, ``__mutex_trylock_fast()`` and
+``__mutex_unlock_fast()`` - read the bit first and put it in both the
+expected and the new value, so each still does a single cmpxchg. Reading
+it needs no lock, because it is sticky.
+
+``percpu_rw_semaphore`` keeps a plain flag, which fits in the padding
+after ``->block``. On ``PREEMPT_RT``, a mutex and an rw_semaphore are
+built on ``rt_mutex_base``, which has no spare bit but does have padding
+after ``->wait_lock``, so the flag goes there.
+
+Those two rely on padding that only exists on 64-bit. On 32-bit
+``percpu_rw_semaphore`` grows by a word, and on 32-bit ``PREEMPT_RT`` so
+does ``rt_mutex_base``, which means everything built on it including
+``spinlock_t``. The sticky bit in ``mutex`` and ``rw_semaphore`` has no
+such problem, as it uses no storage at all.
+
+Until the first lock opts in, each hook is a static branch that is off,
+a 2-byte NOP on x86_64, and the flag reads sit behind it, so every lock
+runs the instructions it ran before. The first opt-in turns the branch
+on for good. After that, an acquire and a release each also read the
+word they are about to update and test the flag, which costs one load
+from a cacheline the lock operation touches anyway.
+``__mutex_trylock_common()`` needs no load of its own, as it already
+has the value.
+
+Where the count changes
+=======================
+
+The count goes up once the lock is taken and down before it is released.
+Waiting is not counted, as the task does not hold the lock yet.
+
+mutex (``!PREEMPT_RT``)
+	Only ``__mutex_trylock_common()`` and ``__mutex_trylock_fast()`` take
+	the lock for current, and only ``__mutex_unlock_fast()`` and
+	``__mutex_unlock_slowpath()`` release it. These four places cover
+	every ``mutex_lock*()``, ``mutex_trylock()``, ``ww_mutex_lock*()``
+	and handoff. ``__mutex_lock_common()`` has no hook of its own: it
+	reaches ``__mutex_trylock_common()`` through ``__mutex_trylock()``
+	and ``__mutex_trylock_or_handoff()``.
+
+mutex (``PREEMPT_RT``)
+	``__mutex_lock_common()``, ``mutex_trylock()``,
+	``_mutex_trylock_nest_lock()`` and ``mutex_unlock()`` in
+	``rtmutex_api.c``.
+
+rw_semaphore
+	The API functions in ``rwsem.c``, which ``PREEMPT_RT`` and
+	``!PREEMPT_RT`` share. ``downgrade_write()`` keeps the lock held, so
+	it needs no hook.
+
+percpu_rw_semaphore
+	``percpu_down_read_internal()``, ``percpu_down_read_trylock()`` and
+	``percpu_up_read()`` in the header, ``percpu_down_write()`` and
+	``percpu_up_write()`` in ``percpu-rwsem.c``, and
+	``percpu_rwsem_acquire()``/``percpu_rwsem_release()``. The read fast
+	and slow paths meet before the hook, so one hook covers both.
+
+Not covered: ``rt_mutex`` used directly, ``ww_mutex`` on ``PREEMPT_RT``
+(it is an ``rt_mutex`` there), ``struct semaphore``, and spinning locks.
+Only ``mutex`` and ``rw_semaphore`` have a ``*_track_holder()`` helper.
+To add a lock type, find it a place to keep the opt-in that does not make
+it bigger, then call ``lock_holder_acquired_if()`` and
+``lock_holder_released_if()`` where it is taken and released. If the lock has a ``bool tracked`` member, as
+``percpu_rw_semaphore`` does, ``lock_holder_acquired()`` and
+``lock_holder_released()`` are the same thing with the member filled in.
+
+Debugging
+=========
+
+``do_exit()`` warns once if a task exits with a non-zero count, and the
+release hook warns once instead of letting the count go below zero.
+Either means a bug, usually a missed hook.
+
+``CONFIG_TRACK_LOCK_HOLDERS_KUNIT_TEST`` tests the count for all three
+lock types::
+
+	tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig=kernel/locking/ lockholder
