Are you allocating 1/16th of the ring size in bytes as an hdbss buffer?
That's confusing. I recommend we rather have something like:

ring_entries = ring_size / sizeof(struct kvm_dirty_gfn);
hdbss_entries = ring_entries / 2; // Or any number we decide to use here.
hdbss_buf_size = hdbss_entries * sizeof(hdbss_buf_entry);

Then we do 
hdbss_buf_size = clamp_t(unsigned long,
                         rounddown_pow_of_two(hdbss_buf_size),
                         SZ_4K, KVM_ARM_HDBSS_MAX_SIZE);

So it's clear what is what here. 
Just dividing by 16 above can be confusing to whoever is reading the code.

Remember to use the sizeof instead of fixed numbers.

Yeah, remember that if you are dealing with the ringbuffer like this, an 
user can request a 4k ringbuffer and we just won't be able to use hdbss, as 
it means 4k/16 entries, and hdbss has the minimum of 4k/8.

As I mentioned, maybe this approach of reserved entries is not the right 
way of dealing with it in arm64.

I see no reason why it could not be higher than that. It all depends on how 
you want to deal with the full buffer in the future patchset. If hdbss 
buffer is full, it has to exit and drain to the dirtyring. The guarantee 
you seek with reserved entries is that all hdbss entries fit in the 
dirty-ring.

As long as the user is required to drain entries until the dirty-ring is 
not 'full' anymore, we could easily work with dirty-ring having twice as 
many entries as the hdbss buffer.

How does it sound?

Thanks!
