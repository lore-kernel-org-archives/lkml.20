If that is what you want, then steal governor is the right choice.

Even if idle load balancing runs on a non-preferred idle CPU, it is going
to do the idle load balancing for all the idle CPUs. Including preferred and
non-preferred. And actual load balancing bails out early and does not pull any
task towards if it is a non-preferred CPU.

Well, when we see steal time, it usually means there is high contention and
we are using more vCPUs at this moment than possible.
So we mark them as non-preferred. Note that they are idle cpus. But non-preferred.

That means preferred CPUs may have more than 1 task. If we spill over if there
is idle non-preferred CPUs, we will be back to square one. No?
