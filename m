A limit counter keeps a value below a limit. An addition fails rather
than take the value above it. The tmpfs size limit uses
percpu_counter_limited_add() for this. It takes no lock while the value
is more than batch * nr_cpus below the limit. With the default batch
size, this range grows as nr_cpus^2: 1.1 GB of pages at 384 CPUs.
Closer to the limit, each addition takes the counter spinlock and sums
all CPUs.

A tree counter has a smaller error bound. But its carries break a
strict check. A carry leaves a level before it arrives at the next one.
A sum taken in between misses it. A carry which arrives first can be
counted twice instead. This is as bad for a negative carry.

So split the value by sign, into two counters which only grow: the
additions and the subtractions. Each one errs in one direction only:

- The additions carry to the next level before they leave the level
  below. A sum read from level 0 up never misses a carry.
- The subtractions carry as usual. A sum read from the root down never
  counts a carry twice.

A carry about to leave an item takes what earlier additions left there.
Until it reaches the root, the check does not see that part. So an item
holding such a carry takes no new arrival. The next carries go straight
to the root. The value is then at most:

  root(additions) + accuracy - root(subtractions)

An addition first adds, then checks after a full barrier. If this bound
is within the limit, it succeeds without a sum or a lock. Within the
accuracy of the limit, the precise sums decide. An addition which does
not fit is undone. The last addition checked sees all the others, so
the limit is never exceeded. Additions must not be made from interrupt
context, and percpu_counter_tree_limit_add() warns if they are.

An addition about to be undone can make a concurrent one fail,
although that one fits. So an amount larger than the batch size is
checked before it is added. If it cannot fit, it fails without being
added. A smaller failed addition retries once if the value leaves room
for it.

The API is percpu_counter_tree_limit_init(), _destroy(), _add(), _sub()
and _precise_sum(). percpu_counter_tree_batch_for_accuracy() chooses
the batch size from the limit.

The shim of the userspace test gains the primitives which the library
now uses.
