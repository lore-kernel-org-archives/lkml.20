Using our example of display scanout once more it is probably better to stop displaying anything then keeping the resources allocated until userspace realizes that the export is not there any more.

OK, let me add some context on how this split came about and why I am
trying to document it.

Several people approached me offline because they need to implement an
importer that supports both revoke and movable flows. These require
completely different implementations in the driver internals.

So, to answer the question, we need to document how these flows are
identified and how they differ.

Naturally, they asked AI first, but all frontier LLMs gave them completely
incorrect answers.

With that goal in mind, could you please help document the dma-buf
lifetime model? "Everything is optional" sounds great, but is quite
misleading.

Thanks
