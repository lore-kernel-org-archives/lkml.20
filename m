That's a pre-existing that this series just made obvious and is fixed by:

fe967191e585 ("fs: don't return -EINVAL for successful nested thaw")

The realtime dm device doesn't get unfrozen after a lockfs
suspend/resume cycle.

So xfs/006, xfs/264, and generic/311 wrap the rt device in its own
flakey device. That suspends data then rt with lockfs and resume rt then
data. So the rt thaw is a nested thaw.

A nested thaw drops the reference but thaw_super_locked() still returns
its -EINVAL because it's still frozen. So bdev_thaw() keeps the count on
error and dm unlock_fs() ignores the result.

That's been broken since 7366f8b6fc6a8. Before this series it was merely
silent on the rt device. We properly refuse mounting devices that are
frozen not just the main device.

And it also meant a second lockfs suspend of a leaked rt device never
froze the filesystem at all...
