Agreed, yes, root can cause a crash and can do tons of horrible things
much worse than this, that's not the issue.

That's why this taint is there, to make it obvious that this is not a
"real" bug at all.

Fine, use it!  Just don't expect that to be "normal".

Agreed, but again, don't rely on this as a "real" solution fo ranything.

How is that going to change anything?  Confused.
