If they live under drivers/gpio/, then I want to route their patches though=
 the
GPIO tree, othrwise we're adding more confusion which is the opposite of th=
e
goal of this series. FWIW I'm fine with it.

If it's not intel hardware but just happens to be used exclusively on intel=

then sure: let's leave it under drivers/gpio/.

We're doing it to make it less confusing for me. If we do it wrong, I'll st=
ill
keep on picking up patches to the wrong drivers or ignoring the ones I shou=

take. :)
