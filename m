I see, makes sense.

This first part which ensures that if there is a class for the monitor then a component can always
be found for the given CPU.

The any_mon_comp check could still be useful to confirm that if r->mon_capable then there is a
component for at least one of the events.

There doesn't necessary need to be a monitoring class associated with any particular event. If there
are classes and so components for each of the two supported events then this check looks correct.
You could ensure that by checking existence:

if (dom->mon_comp[QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID] && dom->mon_comp[QOS_L3_MBM_TOTAL_EVENT_ID] &&
    !cpumask_equal(&dom->mon_comp[QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID]->affinity,
	           &dom->mon_comp[QOS_L3_MBM_TOTAL_EVENT_ID]->affinity))
