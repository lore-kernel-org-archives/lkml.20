I'm not sure it wise to only convert a single item type at a time,
as there are intricacies in different log item life cycles that may
expose difficult to solve issues further down the track. If we've
already converted and merged some of the code before we find that it
needs a fundamental rework, then that's worse that asking reviewers
to review a large patchset.

e.g. the AIL needs to take reference counts and they need to be
factored into log item life cycles, especially the shutdown
processing of items in the AIL.  Right now the AIL is not
responsible for removing items on shutdown because it does not hold
a reference to them. Changing the AIL to own a reference to the log
item means that there is a good chance that the shutdown behaviour
for items in the AIL may need to change...

So I'd be inclined to ensure at least have one of each group of item
types is fully converted (e.g. buf, inode, dquot, EFI, quotaoff) so
that most of the crouching tigers in the design have been flushed
out before asing for code review.

You can also push it to a git repo somewhere so people whoa re
interested can look at it and give early feedback before you are
ready to post it to the list for review...

-Dave.
