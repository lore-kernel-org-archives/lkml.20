Yes, I agree. I think the specific way KVM handles guest state can also be
considered "uarch-specific" and is not part of the ABI guarantee.

I tested this solution, and it passed the selftest in patch 4. Thanks!

But when I think more deeply about what the sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12()
function actually does, I think there are still two points worth
discussing:

1. We call sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12() along the vm-entry failure path; for
   CET, this effectively overwrites the CET guest in vmcs12 with the
   expected L2 CET state.

   Per SDM 29.8, regarding VM-entry failure handling - it states:

   Although this process resembles that of a VM exit, many steps taken
   during a VM exit do not occur for these VM-entry failures:
   • Most VM-exit information fields are not updated (see step 1 above).
   • The valid bit in the injected-event identification field is not cleared.
-> • The guest-state area is not modified.
   • No MSRs are saved into the VM-exit MSR-store area.

   The key point here I want to refer is that the guest state should
   remain unchanged. And considering this case, when VM_ENTRY_LOAD_CET_STATE
   is cleared, KVM tries to load L1's CET state to vmcs02 (vmcs01->vmcs02),
   but sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12() loads vmcs02 CET states back to vmcs12
   (vmcs02->vmcs12), which changes the guest state and such vmcs12 guest
   state is visible to L1 (so, the whole states transition path is:
   vmcs01->vmcs02->vmcs12, the vmcs12 is changed!).

2. I feel sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12() might be doing too much. One issue is
   it updates vmcs12->guest_activity_state based on vcpu->arch.mp_state,
   However, the "correct" vcpu->arch.mp_state is set based on
   vmcs12->guest_activity_state only after the VM-entry succeeds (see
   nested_vmx_run). Therefore, in an extreme case (just code reading, not
   tested yet), GUEST_ACTIVITY_HLT might be set to guest_activity_state,
   but because the vm-entry fails, the value of vcpu->arch.mp_state is
   not updated, so sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12() re-calculates an incorrect
   guest_activity_state.

   Another issue is about vmcs12->guest_linear_address. Per SDM 29.8
   again (the 1st point I listed above), guest_linear_address, as the
   VM-exit information field, is not necessary to be updated.

So, in short, I think sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12() updates too much state,
and it seems we shouldn't directly modify the guest state visible to L1
(i.e., the guest state in vmcs12).

Based on the two points mentioned above, does Option B (which I described
in my cover letter) seem more reasonable? Instead of updatding almost all
states to vmcs12, we can re-use pre_enter_* states:

vmentry_fail_vmexit_guest_mode:
     if (prepared_vmcs02)
             vmcs_read_cet_state(vcpu, &vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_s_cet,
				 &vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_ssp,
				 &vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_ssp_tbl);

then update L1's state based on pre_vmenter_*, and keep vmcs12 guest
states upchanged:

    else if (prepared_vmcs02)
		vmcs_write_cet_state(vcpu, vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_s_cet,
				     vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_ssp,
				     vmx->nested.pre_vmenter_ssp_tbl);

In addition, in this way, pre_vmenter_* should also be synchronized on
the normal exit path with sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12().

However, I’m still hesitant because this intermediate state seems too
fragmented. But considering that vmcs12 is L1 visible — and shouldn’t
be modified arbitrarily — maybe an intermediate state like this is
necessary?

Or maybe we should just go back to my original patch, i.e., Option A,
which eliminates the intermediate state.

Yes, I think both approaches - whether to wait until prepare_vmcs02()
completes cleanly or not - are consistent with the SDM; they can be
viewed as differences in the KVM uarch implementation :-) What the user
sees is the hardware state and the guest VMCS state as presented under
a given load control combination.
