Let me rephrase your point: if you do an O_CREAT without O_EXCL you still
don't know whether it's your file because it might have been there already.
So the fact that you immediately get an fd still does not tell you everything.
Right?

But, at least you'll know it's a directory and you still save a syscall.
On the other hand, maybe that just breeds incorrect use, and if needed the
O_EXCL-less variant can always be added, so we might as well force its use
for now. Then again, it might be confusing to do open(O_CREAT|O_DIRECTORY)
and get an -EINVAL or -EEXISTS, given current O_CREAT semantics for regular
files.

I don't have LLM access right now: are there any ->atomic_open() implementations
currently that do return negative dentries? Seems to be a bit strange, just like
with ->mkdir(). What would be the purpose?

Fair enough. I'll spin this idea up then, to add the lookup to kern/tracefs
->mkdir() and add that warning to vfs_mkdir(). And I'll CC those maintainers
on that version.

OK, if it isn't likely that any ->atomic_open() wants O_CREAT|O_DIRECTORY
support we can get rid of some of the complexity. Summarize:

1. use ->atomic_open(O_DIRECTORY) for lookup, no O_CREAT bit passed in.
2. if positive then done, otherwise (on -ENOENT) we call ->mkdir()
3. open that dentry in the regular way, WARN_ON negative dentry return

Best,
Jori.

PS. Maybe I asked already before (in case apologies), but will you be
at LPC?
