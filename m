Well, if we change the DT and the code, they fight each other, and would 
be off by one again. So we need to decide for one solution, and since 
this affects the DT, this has compatibility implications. At the moment 
the code assumes that GPIO IRQ counting starts with PortA, regardless of 
whether this implemented or not. That does not sound very future proof: 
while A523 specifies an IRQ for PortA (even though it's not 
implemented!), I am afraid future SoCs might not.
So having Pablo's patch would make a lot of sense, but would break with 
the just changed DT for the A523. That former DT change was fine, since 
it never worked before, and the new v7.2 DT should work on older kernels 
even.
So we could revert the DT patch, and take Pablo's code patch, with a 
Fixes: tag, but that would create some broken combinations meanwhile.

And in any case we should add a word to the binding document, to pin 
down what's expected here.

Cheers,
Andre.
