Hi Joanne,

Thanks for your careful review! I don't think that case can actually
occur. Let me walk through the scenarios where the
(pos + offset + length) >> PAGE_SHIFT calculation is kept as the final
end value:

1) offset + length == size:
   The truncate range aligns exactly with the folio boundary, so
   (pos + offset + length) >> PAGE_SHIFT points to the start of the next
   folio, not the middle of one.

2) !folio_try_get(folio2):
   The folio at that position has already been freed or is being freed,
   so there is no folio in the page cache at that location. The
   subsequent find_get_entries() won't find anything there.

3) !folio_test_large(folio2):
   folio2 is no longer large, likely split to order-0 by a concurrent
   operation. For an order-0 folio, the page index and folio index are
   the same, so the calculation is correct.

4) folio2 becomes stale:
   The same to case 2), folio2 is removed from the address space, so
   there is no large folio straddling the boundary that needs
   protection. The caller won't get folio from here through
   find_get_entries(). Using the page index is safe here.

If a large folio straddles the boundary at (offset + length), we will
successfully get a reference via folio_try_get(folio2) and
folio_test_large(folio2) will be true. In that case, if the split fails
(cannot lock or split operation fails), we set tail_isolated to false
and set *end = folio2->index to point to the start of that large folio
since tail_isolated.

The page index from this setting is only kept when no large folio exists
at the boundary, which makes it safe to use. What is particularly
noteworthy is that for cases 2 and 4 above, aside from setting it to
(pos + offset + length) >> PAGE_SHIFT, there does not seem to be any
better alternative.

Does this make sense or am I missing something?

Thanks,
Yi.
