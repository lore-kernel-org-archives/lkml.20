Subject: [PATCH v2 13/19] perf test attr: Ignore the group read_format bit the PMU count can remove

From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

read_format's PERF_FORMAT_GROUP bit asks for the group members to be read
along with the leader, which aside from this bit is verified with the
fd/group_fd based group checking in Test.compare(), and with more than
one core PMU a group whose members are pinned to one of them, say
'default_core', leaves the clones for the other core PMUs without any
members:

  $ perf stat -e '{cycles,default_core/legacy-hardware-config=3/}:S'
  ... the A53 leader keeps its cohort, both A73 cycles clones are alone,
      read_format 20 instead of 28

so that bit isn't there: whether it is there is a consequence of how the
evlist got expanded to more than one core PMU, not of the groupness the
expectations say about, which is verified structurally, so take it out on
both sides.

That leaves the A73 leader clones, now with:

  expected read_format=28|31, got 20

matching the base event expectations again.

With a single core PMU there is nothing to expand, so there is nothing to
explain away: count the core PMUs when the script starts, from what perf
makes of 'cycles', see parse_events_multi_pmu_add(), and take the bit out
only when there is more than one, leaving the machines with a single core
PMU verifying what the expectations say about it.  That count is 2 on the
Amlogic A311D, where its A53 and A73 PMUs both answer for 'cycles', and 1
on a machine with a single core PMU.  Where there is no binding to ask,
as when attr.py runs without setup_python.sh, the count isn't available
and the bit is taken out as well.
