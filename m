Hello, Liz.

The late inode has to be one without a pending lazytime update. One
already on b_dirty_time keeps its position and dirtied_when.

cleanup_offline_cgwbs_workfn() skips wbs with anything on b_dirty, b_io
or b_more_io. So the scan has to land between wb_writeback() fixing
dirtied_before and taking list_lock for the first queue_io(), which is a
few instructions. The exception is a multi-pass drain that started
before the wb got dirty IO, as the loop doesn't recheck. Maybe say that
the window is narrow so that stable can weigh it?

A pass keeps the inodes it walks in order, so the only reordering is
between the walked inodes and the ones a filled pass didn't reach. "or a
later pass walks past it" doesn't seem to be a separate case.

The description is pretty long for a six-line fix. Maybe drop this
paragraph, which Suggested-by and Link already cover, move the test
details below ---, and tighten the rest?

The inodes' dirtied_when doesn't change. What moves is their list
position. Maybe something like:

	/*
	 * The scan moves walked inodes to the newest end of b_dirty_time,
	 * past ones it didn't reach. If one of those was dirtied after a
	 * sync's cutoff, the sync's queue_io() stops there and misses the
	 * moved ones. Exclude syncs as process_inode_switch_wbs() does.
	 */

None of the above is blocking.
