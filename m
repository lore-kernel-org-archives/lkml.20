In future series or update, can you use common formatting in the future, I =
find
your changelog hard to read. Do something like:

  Since v1:
   - Changed patch X with action Z
   - Fix blabla=20
   - ...

Its actually good to be more concise in your communication, "wall of text" =
are
difficult to cope with for maintainers.

cheers,
Nicolas
