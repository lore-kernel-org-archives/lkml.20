Supplementation.
This may be a potential security concern. The host virtio-blk proxy driver exposes
API for key programming, the input parameters are blk_crypto key and virtual
slot. If a malicious program replace the key in a specific virtual slot between
key program call and I/O submission via this API, the data would be encrypted
by the unintentional key.
