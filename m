Thank you for bringing this up; I was not aware of this code path and
researched it a bit.

Let me try to paraphrase the issue to make sure I understand:

1. A process creates a PTY device and acquires the PTY master FD.
2. The process then restricts itself into a signal-scoped Landlock domain.
3. Processes outside of the domain are attached to the terminal
4. Through the PTY master FD, the master process emulates a terminal
   to the attached processes.  One of the commands it can issue is
   TIOCSIG, allowing the PTY master process to send SIGINT ("Ctrl-C"),
   SIGQUIT ("Ctrl-\") or SIGTSTP ("Ctrl-Z") to TTY-attached processes,
   which may live *outside* the Landlock domain.  (source:
   pty_signal() in drivers/tty/pty.c)

TIOCSIG was introduced in 2010 in Linux [1] and in 1989 in BSD (quoted
in the Linux patch).  According to the patch, it is only required in a
special terminal mode where the mapping of signals is disabled.

In more normal operation modes, the terminal interprets these keyboard
shortcuts sent as characters.  This is implemented in
n_tty_receive_char_special() when you write() the characters '\x03'
(Ctrl-C), '\x1c' (Ctrl-\) or '\x1a' (Ctrl-Z) to the PTY master FD.
(Your proposed patch does not fix this either, even though it sends
the same signals.)

Additionally, PTYs can send:

* SIGWINCH (when you do ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ) on the master FD)
* SIGHUP and SIGCONT

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/E1OR73h-0004VN-JE@lirone.symas.net/


In summary:

* Sending signals to attached processes is a very normal way how PTYs
  interact with the attached processes, and TIOCSIG is not the only
  cause for it.
* Processes are attached to a PTY because they were started on that
  PTY or they have voluntarily attached to it.

With these two points in mind, I am leaning towards treating access to
the PTY master FD as a "capability" whose acquisition can already be
adequately restricted with existing Landlock controls.  Like
socketpair(), which Landlock also don't restrict, the creation of a
new PTY always returns a new master and client side TTY FD and it
feels to me more effective to control who attaches to these than to
control the TTY-internal communication protocols itself.

Maybe the way to think about this is to say that it is the *TTY
driver* which is sending these signals in response to the PTY master
FD receiving a TIOCSIG or having a Ctrl-C written to it.  This is
similar to a SSH or Telnet daemon which can also trigger signals for
the attached processes on the other end of the terminal by sending the
right commands over the wire, and I also don't see an issue with that,
because in the same way as here, the client programs have voluntarily
attached to the TTY. 🤔

Does that seem reasonable?  I am happy to be corrected if this
analysis is wrong.

If you agree, I think the best path forward might be to document it
more clearly that TTY interactions are not part of the SCOPE_SIGNAL
guarantees.
