Yay :)

This makes sense to me, thank you for the context also.

Just to make sure I thoroughly understand, do you envisage a 
dma_buf_get_active() to take both a reference on a dmabuf and its 
corresponding dmabuf->file so such users can move to a pattern of get-
test-use-put on the file portion too?  Sorry if it's a silly question, 
I'm not sure what to search for.

I had given the unfamiliar code the benefit of the doubt, but this did 
look a bit suspect!  Will do, thanks.


Matt

PS: I should've mentioned that Alex Mastro has kindly built a reproducer 
using a VFIO DMABUF export and dentry-held-open scenario.  KASAN will 
detect the UAF:
