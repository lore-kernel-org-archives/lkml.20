Subject: [PATCH v3] drm/rockchip: vop2: Scale the AXI clock to the bandwidth the mode needs
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2026 15:08:24 +0200

VOP2 fetches the scanout data for all of its video ports over a single
AXI clock.  On RK3588 that clock is pinned to 500 MHz by the device tree
and nothing ever raises it, so a mode whose pixel rate outruns what the
AXI clock can deliver underruns the internal scanout FIFO.  The hardware
reports this as POST_BUF_EMPTY and the picture is corrupted.

3840x2160@120 over DisplayPort is such a mode.  Measured on an Orange Pi
5 Plus by moving the rate at runtime while the mode was up, with dclk
unchanged at 594 MHz throughout, so that the AXI rate was the only
variable:

  500 MHz: ~594000 suppressed vop2_isr callbacks per 5 s, corrupted
  750 MHz: no POST_BUF_EMPTY at all for the 42 s the phase lasted, clean
  500 MHz: ~607000 suppressed callbacks per 5 s, corrupted again

Both transitions are immediate.  Heiko Stuebner reports the same
starvation on different hardware [1].

The requirement follows each port's pixel rate rather than its interface
clock, and it is per port rather than aggregate.  Two measurements at
500 MHz pin that down:

  - a single port scanning out 3840x2160@120 underruns, while the same
    composed pixel rate spread over three ports - 3840x2160@60 on one
    and 3840x2160@30 on two others - is clean for a minute with no
    underrun on any of them.  The totals are equal to the pixel:
    3840*2160*120 == 3840*2160*(60+30+30).

  - 3840x2160@60 is clean where 3840x2160@120 is not, although both run
    dclk at 594 MHz on this board: the 120 Hz link is YCbCr 4:2:0, which
    halves dclk without halving the rate at which the port consumes
    pixels.

So the condition belongs on each video port's own crtc_clock.  Summing
across ports would be wrong, and keying on dclk would miss 4:2:0
entirely.  The threshold sits between the measured points: 3840x2160@60
(594000 kHz) and 2560x1440@144 (about 586000 kHz) are both clean at the
default rate, 3840x2160@120 (1188000 kHz) is not.

Track the requirement as a global atomic state object: a CRTC that is
being modeset records what its port needs during its own atomic check,
and the rate applied is the maximum over the ports, never below the
rate the platform set up.  Because the clock is shared, it is programmed
from the commit tail rather than from the per-CRTC enable and disable
hooks: it is held at the rate both the old and the new configuration
need from before the first CRTC is touched until every CRTC has moved
over, and only then settled at what the new configuration needs.
Commits that share nothing but this object are ordered through it, the
way vc4 orders commits that share its core clock: each modeset commit
records itself per port and the next one waits for those before it
touches the clock.  The settle write goes out before commit_hw_done(),
which is all the next commit waits for, so it cannot land after that
commit's own.  Page flips do not take the object and are not held up by
it.

rockchip_drm_private carries a pointer to the hooks, and only VOP2 on
RK3588 sets it, so the commit tail is unchanged for every other Rockchip
SoC.

Tested on the same board on a drm-misc-next based tree plus the dw-dp
and Rockchip USBDP PHY series, which DisplayPort Alt Mode needs in order
to come up at all, with three outputs up (DisplayPort and two HDMI):
3840x2160@120 on the DisplayPort output selects 750 MHz, 3840x2160@60
returns the clock to 500 MHz and going back raises it again; disabling
both HDMI outputs at once while the DisplayPort one runs 3840x2160@120
keeps 750 MHz throughout and re-enabling them keeps it; the same
sequence at 3840x2160@60 stays at 500 MHz; no POST_BUF_EMPTY in any of
it.

v3:
 - Program the clock from the commit tail instead of the per-CRTC enable
   and disable hooks, and order commits that share only the private
   object through it - the full vc4 pattern rather than half of it.  The
   Sashiko review of v2 [2] found that without an atomic_commit_setup
   hook two non-blocking commits sharing only the private object can
   apply their rates out of order, and that a commit disabling several
   CRTCs lowered the clock from the first atomic_disable while the other
   ports were still scanning out.  Chaoyi Chen was fine with placing it
   in atomic_commit_tail [3].  The settle write is issued before
   drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done(), since the next commit only waits
   for that.
 - Only modeset commits take the private object, so a page flip on one
   port no longer waits for the previous commit on every other port.
 - Free the RGB encoder when drm_atomic_private_obj_init() fails [2].
 - Initialise state->obj in create_state as every other private object
   does; v2 left it NULL and the debugfs state dump dereferences it.
 - Report a failed clk_set_rate() instead of ignoring it.
 - Retested with three outputs, including disabling two of them at
   once; see the commit message.  The out-of-order case is not one I
   can provoke from userspace: it is covered by the ordering, not by a
   measurement.
 - Boardcon reports tearing during multi-CRTC reconfiguration in
   production multi-display use on their RK3588 board (dual HDMI plus DP,
   three screens to one), a sustained 3-5 C junction increase at 750 MHz
   on a fanless RK3588J, and offered to test [4]; Cc'd.
 - Mainline has no other code touching this clock.  A tree that carries
   the downstream "Scale ACLK rate up for RK3588 FRL display modes"
   change should not carry both: this patch keys on the pixel rate,
   which is what the FIFO sees, and the two must not fight over the
   clock.
 - Rebased on drm-misc-next 0878e6053d01d.

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260813094614.9072-1-royalnet026@gmail.com/
 - Each CRTC records its own requirement in a global atomic state object
   instead of the rate being computed by walking the CRTC list, which
   read state the commit holds no lock for (Sashiko review of v1).
