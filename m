Hi Justin,

Thank you for engaging me on this RFC. Admittedly, I have not followed
the landlock discussions closely. This was an idea I had concocted while
thinking how we can make Nix sandboxing faster.
(I'm also exploring the space with AI - so I'm a landlock newbie but not
a Nix newbie.)

Mickael, et al: I see that sashiko found some legitimate concerns.
I can fix that up in a V2 if we like the general idea and want to
continue exploring it.

On the cost:

only entries created directly in the directory that has
the rule get recorded. For Nix that is /nix/store, so a build records
one entry per output ($out, $dev, ...). Nothing is recorded for
$out/foo or anything else under $out.

Access there is allowed because the path walk at access time reaches
$out and finds it in the recorded set, the same way a rule on a directory
covers what is beneath it. Existing store paths are never recorded, so the
store's size does not matter... right?

A bad actor could still create many entries in the store
(touch /nix/store/junk1 ... junk1000000), and each one stays pinned
until the domain is freed. I can add a per-domain limit on the number
of created entries. Nix only needs as many as the derivation has
outputs ($out, $dev etc..).

On NO_INHERIT: besides the O(store) cost, other builds keep adding
paths to the store while this one runs. Those new paths have no
NO_INHERIT rule, so they would inherit the store-wide access and be
readable by the build. With the CREATED flag, nothing is readable
unless a rule covers it.
