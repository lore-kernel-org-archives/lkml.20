Yes，we do have a full test suite, but it runs per machine topology. The
3dbbbf656b85 validation ran on the direct-attach configuration, since
the HA resume race it was fixing was originally reported there. The
expander topology was covered in the next test round, and this
deadlock showed up as soon as we switched to it: on that topology
every ATA port resume goes through the EH reset (that is how
ata_sas_port_resume() is implemented), so the SMP IO against the
ongoing runtime resume happens on essentially every cycle.

Aha - each respin addressed a review finding on the PM
reference handling, not a re-fix of the deadlock. The core fix is
unchanged since v1.

That addresses the pre-existing issue which Sashiko flagged: the
return value of pm_runtime_get_sync() was ignored, so on a failed
resume the code would blindly proceed to submit the SMP task anyway.
Simply checking the return of pm_runtime_get_sync() would be awkward:
it keeps the usage counter incremented even on failure, so the error
path would also need a manual pm_runtime_put_noidle() to balance it.
pm_runtime_resume_and_get() rolls the counter back internally and
returns 0 or an errno, so the check is just "if (res) return res;"

Outside the resume window, the caller that needs the resume is BSG
userspace SMP requests (sas_smp_handler): ses/expander tools query
the topology at any time and nothing else holds the host awake, so
the host may have autosuspended; the resume also re-registers the
devices (the PHYE -> dev_found path runs inside the resume), so the
IO can proceed. This is the case 0da7ca4c4fd9 was written for.
The other callers either cannot run while the host is suspended or
already hold their own PM reference, so they never exercise the
resume path.
