The tmpfs swapin and allocation paths are currently a blind spot for
tracing: the swap layer has no tracepoints at all, the existing
counters cannot attribute events to a file, and an mTHP request can be
silently downgraded at two layers - or fail outright - with only one
of those having any accounting.

On the swapin side:

- PGMAJFAULT only accounts the page fault path; swapins triggered by
  read()/write()/fallocate()/truncate/symlink go through
  shmem_get_folio() with vmf/fault_type NULL and are not counted
- PSWPIN/ZSWPIN are counted at the I/O and zswap layers with global
  and memcg granularity, but cannot be attributed to an inode or file
- the mTHP order degradations in shmem_swap_alloc_folio() (uffd/zswap
  forced order-0, order-0 retry after sync allocation failure) have
  no counters at all, unlike the swapout side which counts
  THP_SWPOUT_FALLBACK and MTHP_STAT_SWPOUT_FALLBACK

On the allocation side:

- the order mask from shmem_suitable_orders() (vma filtering, page
  cache layout conflicts) can drop the order with no counter at all;
  the code comment notes that -EEXIST "would be the right code, but
  not here"
- the allocation fallback loop is counted by MTHP_STAT_SHMEM_FALLBACK
  without attribution
- a fully masked-out request fails with -ENOMEM while the caller
  silently retries at order 0
- when mem_cgroup_charge() fails with the target range already
  occupied, the error is rewritten to -EEXIST, making a cgroup limit
  event indistinguishable from a benign insertion race

Patch 1 adds a single shmem_swapin_folio event at every return from
shmem_swapin_folio(): the original caller index and XArray entry, the
requested (entry) and actual (folio) orders, the branch taken -
validation failure, initial swap cache hit, synchronous helper,
readahead helper, or poison marker - and the return value. For the
synchronous helper it also records why the request became order 0: a
fallback bitmask reporting the userfaultfd and zswap restrictions
together when both apply, sync_fail plus the initial errno when a
higher-order attempt failed and was retried, or none.

The fallback field is a bitmask rather than an enum because the two
policy restrictions are independent: a VMA can have userfaultfd armed
while the boot-wide zswap latch is also set. Reporting only one value
would hide that the other restriction must also go away before large
folios come back. sync_fail never combines with them - a policy
downgrade forces order 0 before the first attempt, so the retry that
sets sync_fail can only run when no policy bit was set.

Patch 2 adds a shmem_alloc_folio_finish event with the full order
chain (requested/suitable/actual) separating VMA and page-cache
filtering from allocator fallback, a stage value (filter, alloc,
charge, cache, account, done) identifying where the attempt ended,
and both the stage errno and the returned errno: a memcg charge
failure stays visible as error=-ENOMEM even when a page-cache
conflict rewrites the return to -EEXIST. A fully filtered-out request
reports stage=filter with error=0 and suitable_order=-1 because no
allocator call occurred. Successes at the requested order - including
ordinary base-page allocations - are omitted, so order-0 traffic
never floods the ring buffer.

shmem_swapin_folio does fire on every swapin attempt, and that is
deliberate: a swapin is a major-fault or I/O slow path whose rate is
bounded by actual swap traffic, and each event is precisely what
PSWPIN cannot attribute. Folio allocation is the opposite - it runs
for every page ever touched, "succeeded at the requested order"
carries no information, and it is already counted by
MTHP_STAT_SHMEM_ALLOC and THP_FILE_ALLOC. Hence the asymmetric
gating between the two patches. Both events, their fields and the
attempt semantics are documented in Documentation/trace/events-shmem.rst.

Three questions answered up front:

Why not vmstat counters?  Counters show trends, tracepoints do
per-inode attribution; the two are complementary, and the trend side
already has its counters.

Why not eBPF/kprobes?  BPF programs attach to tracepoints, so this
series is an enabler for BPF rather than competition. The interesting
data is mid-function state (suitable_order is a local consumed by the
fallback loop, the fallback bitmask is an internal policy decision,
and the charge error is rewritten in place before the return) that is
not visible at any function boundary; the functions involved are
static and may be inlined, so kprobe scripts silently break across
kernel versions, while a tracepoint's fields are documented in its
format file and any change is visible in review.

Why not extend trace_mm_filemap_add_to_page_cache()?  tmpfs never
emits it.  Its only call site is in mm/filemap.c, while
shmem_add_to_page_cache() runs its own XArray insertion loop with no
trace calls at all, so tmpfs folios entering the page cache produce
no filemap event.  Even if they did, it reports only the final order -
no requested/suitable/actual chain, no stage, no errno - and nothing
whatsoever for the swapin side.

Reproduced on x86_64 (8 CPUs), kernel v7.3.0-rc3 + this series, tmpfs
on disk-backed swap with cgroup v1 memory limits forcing swapout
deterministically; zram provides the SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO device for
the synchronous path.

Swapin attribution - three tmpfs files (400M + 500M + 150M) charged
to one cgroup, 965M forced out with a 100M limit, then the 400M and
150M files read back with read():

    PSWPIN +116219 pages, PGMAJFAULT +0

    ino=2 (db_shm,    400M, read back): 102400 events - every one of
                                        its 102400 pages
    ino=3 (app_cache, 500M, untouched):      0 events
    ino=4 (misc,      150M, read back):  16661 events, exactly the
                                        pages that had left memory

104528 events took the cache branch and 14533 the readahead branch;
all carry error=0 and fallback=none. PGMAJFAULT never moved while
119061 read()-triggered swapin events were recorded.

mTHP order degradation on the readahead path - huge=always mount,
512M faulted in as 256 2M folios, 414M swapped out to disk swap and
read back:

    102672 events  requested_order=0 actual_order=0
      1656 events  requested_order=5 actual_order=0
      1449 events  requested_order=6 actual_order=0
       207 events  requested_order=9 actual_order=0

The 3312 events with requested_order > 0 all came back order 0 while
fallback stays none: the readahead path returning a smaller folio
without any policy downgrade, exactly the case the documentation
describes.

Synchronous whole-folio swapin - the same workload with zram as the
swap device and the zswap latch unset:

    207 events, all path=sync requested_order=9 actual_order=9

207 2M folios account for the 414M that went out: with no policy
restriction the synchronous helper preserves the entry order end to
end.

zswap policy downgrade - zswap enabled once then disabled (arming the
one-way latch), 128M fault-written with zram swap, 90M forced out:

    23040 events, one per page swapped out
      720 events with requested_order > 0, every one fallback=zswap
          360 order=5 / 315 order=6 / 45 order=9, all actual_order=0

fallback_error=0 and error=0 throughout: policy downgrades, not
failed attempts. The remaining 22320 events are order-0 entries that
had nothing to downgrade (fallback=none).

Combined policy restrictions - a userfaultfd registered over the
faulting VMA plus the armed zswap latch, 158M forced out and read
back through the armed VMA. This is the case a single-value fallback
field cannot report:

    1264 events  fallback=userfaultfd|zswap
        632 order=5 / 553 order=6 / 79 order=9, all actual_order=0

The 39184 order-0 events in the same run report fallback=none: an
order-0 request has nothing to downgrade.

Allocation filtering - MADV_NOHUGEPAGE 64K stripes every 2M on a
huge=always mount, 512M fault-written:

    1280 events, all stage=done error=0 ret=0
    256 each for requested_order=9 with suitable_order and
    actual_order of 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8

Not one 2M folio is allocated across the whole 512M file
(shmem_alloc 2M stat delta 0), yet nothing today reports why.

Allocation failures under a cgroup limit - 300M fault-written inside
a 100M memory limit, 8365 events in one run:

    1976 stage=charge  error=-12 ret=-12  memcg charge failure, the
                                         errno preserved
    1976 stage=filter  error=0    ret=-12  suitable_order=-1
                                         actual_order=-1, no
                                         allocator call occurred
    4413 stage=done    error=0    ret=0    cascade fallback,
                                         suitable_order 1 to 9

Filesystem accounting - a 16m tmpfs mount written with 64M of 4K
pwrites: 24576 stage=account events, all error=-28 ret=-28, firing
at the block where accounting ran out; 12288 carry requested_order=9
(the large-folio write attempt) and 12288 requested_order=0 (its
order-0 retry), two events per failed write.

Negative controls: 0 events for re-reading a file already in cache,
0 with the events disabled, and 0 for a 64M plain order-0 write
(patch 2's volume filter).

Not exercised at runtime: path=lookup and path=poison with nonzero
error, fallback=sync_fail with fallback_error (these need a failing
higher-order synchronous attempt or fault injection), userfaultfd
without zswap (the latch is one-way per boot and was already armed
for the combined test), stage=alloc with a real allocator failure,
and stage=cache (a concurrent insertion race). Everything quoted
above was observed on the target machine.
