Hmm, I agree L2 would be a tall order, but L1 userspace running against KVM=
 can
definitely get bad state into the vCPU by abusing KVM ioctls.  So not a VM-=
to-host
DoS, but still an unprivileged DoS (given that /dev/kvm isn't usually locke=
d down
by default).  Of course that would still require L0 KVM to have a missing c=
heck,
or require L1 KVM to be buggy and let userspace modify vTPR.

Eh, not sure if that matters in practice though.

I agree, but KVM has historically had a *lot* of those types of internal er=
rors.
Even now I genuinely don't know if we have 100% coverage and accuracy.  I s=
uppose
we could add a cap or quirk the existing behavior, but I'd prefer not to do=
 that,
because odds are good the restore code would eventually bitrot.

I guess I'd be up for having AI audit the checks, and then ripping out
nested_vmx_restore_host_state() in 7.5 in favor of kvm_prepare_emulation_fa=
ilure_exit().
That change is pretty darn easy, and would likely revert cleanly too if it =
came
to that.  Sashiko would probably even understand the implications without e=
xtra
guidance, i.e. would hopefully flag missed checks as new features are added=
, so
maybe my maintenance concerns are unfounded.
