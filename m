I don't have a specific passthrough workload that triggered this in
production. I ran into it while testing blk-iocost accounting coverage.

The relevant concern here is cgroup IO isolation. The expectation of
blkcg IO control is that the IO consumed by a cgroup is reflected in its
accounting and subject to blkcg IO policies. Today that is true for IO
going through submit_bio(), but not for passthrough requests.

The concrete observation was that the same cgroup issuing equivalent
writes through two paths gets different results: normal bio IO is
accounted in io.stat and subject to blkcg IO policies, while SG_IO
writes consume device bandwidth without accounting or blkcg IO control.

So the motivation is not a particular SG_IO application, but whether
passthrough IO should be considered part of the IO usage controlled by
blkcg.

I don't know yet whether the right answer is always-on behavior or an
opt-in mechanism. The RFC was mainly to discuss whether passthrough
paths should be covered by blkcg accounting/enforcement at all.

Thanks,
Tao
