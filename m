Thank you both, I will tie the activation to kvm init, gated on the
kvm-arm.mode.

We could, again gate this on kvm-arm.mode. RMM is not useful without
the capability to run realms. The dependency is the other way around.
If an RMM exists and would be used for any other device TSM, then it
should act as the TSM for all devices, to make sure we have a single
TSM managing the IDEs (and the SPDM connections).

So, tying this again to the kvm-arm.mode=rmm, i.e., the capability
to run Realms makes sense to me. Thoughts ?
