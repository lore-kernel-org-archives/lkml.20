I'm taking a look at these again for 7.3.  This is still missing quite a
few of the crypto library structs.  I would prefer to handle them all in
a consistent way.

Also, given that we'll end up with a lot of these, we should be
thoughtful about the kerneldoc.  Using aes_enckey as an example:

/**
 * aes_zeroize_enckey() - Zeroize an aes_enckey structure
 * @key: The location of the key structure that should be zeroized
 *
 * Explicitly fills the aes_enckey with zeroes. For example, use it with
 * __cleanup() for local aes_enckey structures on the stack, so that their
 * content is not leaked when the context is left.
 */

It's not clear what is meant by "context".  And it doesn't explicitly
connect the zeroization requirement to the lifetime of the struct, so I
don't think it makes it clear when this should be called.  It also says
nothing about kfree_sensitive() which many users should use instead.

Meanwhile, aes_prepareenckey() already has the following, which at least
connects the zeroization requirement to the lifetime of the key:

   * The caller is responsible for zeroizing both the struct aes_enckey and the    
   * raw key once they are no longer needed.

How about we remove that and the free-form description of
aes_zeroize_enckey(), and instead expand the comment on the struct
itself:

/**
 * struct aes_enckey - An AES key prepared for encryption
 * ...
 * Once prepared, users must zeroize this struct at the end of its lifetime.     
 * For stack-allocated structs, use __cleanup(aes_zeroize_enckey) to zeroize     
 * when the variable goes out of scope.  For slab-allocated structs, use         
 * kfree_sensitive() or else call aes_zeroize_enckey() before freeing.       
 */

That would connect the zeroization requirement to the actual struct and
its lifetime, and make it clear how to handle each case.  It would also
make it clear that stack allocation is supported for this struct, which
might not have been obvious before.

aes_zeroize_enckey() would then omit a free-form description, which
makes sense as it's a trivial wrapper around memzero_explicit():

/**
 * aes_zeroize_enckey() - Zeroize an aes_enckey structure
 * @key: The aes_enckey to zeroize
 */
static inline void aes_zeroize_enckey(struct aes_enckey *key)
{
	memzero_explicit(key, sizeof(*key));
}

Similarly for all the other structs, of course.

(For the hash contexts, the struct comment should mention that the
finalization function zeroizes as well.)

Does that sound good?
