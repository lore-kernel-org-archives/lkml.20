Sorry it took me so long to get to this. I promise I wasn't hiding - it
just happened to fall down the gaps in my various flurries of reading
IIO from latest emails back in time over the last few weeks.

I'd managed to blank the whole complexity of multi channel SD demodulators
from my mind since the earlier discussion that was linked (thanks for that
- I now remember how these work - though maybe not how we ended up with
the binding).  We are still evolving so it is also possible the solution
from that isn't how we'd do it today.

As to the question of front end vs backend question, Nuno is probably best person
to give input on that but let me have a go.

Backends tend to the datashifter / manging engines that deal with taking
data from the 'front end' which is typically the ADC device with the actual
pins to which we connect analog signals.  Examples being parallel interfaces
and the many weird and wonderful specialist SPI engines.

Front ends as mentioned are the devices to which the inputs are connected.
I think that aligns with what Conor was suggesting (and the quick discussion
we had in Prague 10 days or so back).

The problem you have with the multiple modulators is actually pretty similar
to the one we have with chained SPI devices or those weird addressable ones.
 - share a bus
 - extra address bits that allow any given device to 'sometimes' ignore messages.
 - magic registers that are written whatever the address bits.
 - Special read out sequences that let you 'stream' from multiple devices.
 - For these we currently constrain things to 'like' devices rather than a mix.

A single data pipe (the interleaver here?) is taking data from multiple front end devices.

A question here.  Do you care about mixed modulator types? The example
suggests you do.  Which puts us in the situation of something like
 ____________              _______           ___________
|Modulator 1 |            |       |         |           |
|(ADC)       |-pulsetrain-|Demod 1|-Digital-|Interleaver|
|____________|            |_______|         | (Skipping |
 ____________              _______          |  dflt as  |-> Software dmux
| Modulator 2|            |       |         |  diag too |
|(Audio/ADC) |-Pulsetrain-|Demod 2|-Digital-|  fat)     |
|____________|            |_______|         |___________|

In this if we just took the top half, then simples, the
Demodulator 1 and Interleaver (not interleaving) would
be a normal IIO Backend for the Modulator 1 (kind of
the ADC). 

If we take the whole thing (but with bottom as an Audio
channel, not an ADC) then effectively we have a backend
backing both signal types and it's up to software to unwind
what turns up in memory.

Note that a lot of what follows isn't stuff that ends
up in DT, but I'm trying to represent the dataflows through
IIO. Some of this is very idealistic :(  Also my terminology
is probably garbage. For me demods go from an encoded signal
on one line to ADC samples. I suspect that maps to the acquisition
bit of the digital filters in this device.

If they are both IIO style ADCs then this runs into the
same challenges as SPI chaining.  We really would want to
end up with a composite device that presents

Imagine A for example was an a multichannel analog device such
as a 2 axis analog Accelemeter.  The ultimate IIO device we want
would represent that A.  We have these in tree and they work
by being consumers of ADC channels but assume those channels
come from a single IIO ADC.  Here the snag is that
Modulators 1 and and 2 would naturally be separate IIO 'devices'.
(Note there is an example like A in the datasheet - middle of figure
378 - key is the shared clock I think)

So conceptually we have

 __   ____________        _______     ___________           __________

|A |   ____________       _______    |  dflt as  |-SWDemux |__________|
|  |  | Modulator 2|     |       |   |  diag too |       \  __________

|__|  |____________|     |_______|   |___________|         | A chan 1 |
                                                           | (mod 2)  |
                                                           |__________|

But then we actually want to have A as one device which
conceptually requires a mux

 __   ____________        _______     ___________          __________
|  |  |Modulator 1 |     |       |   |           |        | Data for |
|  |--|(ADC)       |-pdm-|Demod 1|-D-|Interleaver|        | A chan 0 |

|A |   ____________       _______    |  dflt as  |-SWDemux|__________| SWMux - Data A
|  |  | Modulator 2|     |       |   |  diag too |       \ __________ /
|  |--|(ADC)       |-pdm-|Demod 2|-D-|  fat)     |        | Data for |
|__|  |____________|     |_______|   |___________|        | A chan 1 |
                                                          | (mod 2)  |
                                                          |__________|

Obviously in practice we want some way of flattening the and mux
so that we don't actually do anything. (FWIW we haven't yet built
a SW mux concept into IIO, though it has come up a few times for
this soft of case).

So what is what in this model.

A - Simple IIO consumer of Modulator 1 and Modulator 2.
Modulator 1/2 - IIO front end devices - each a device on its own.
Demod 1/2 + interleaver - IIO backend (data mangler)

SWdemux - new concept we need to unwind from a backend that provides
          service to a pair of front end (actually similar to the IIO
	  demux. Might be able to reuse that)
Data for A chan 0.  Kind of a virtual backend for the top half of diag.

SWMux - new concept that we haven't built - but here it is only theoretical
        anyway because we don't want to demux then remux. Trick is
        never use the apparent interfaces for the IIO devices
        representing the modulator

Anyhow, how on earth to we map this to DT. Hmm..

We don't need to represent the device A, though we may need to figure
that out by looking for devices pointing to the backend and build it
in software.

The backend should be both the demodulators and the interleaver
(which I think maps to interleaver + digital fiters + the serial
 interfaces in this case).
Stuff to the right is all software concepts.

How to indicate what is interleaved?  Maybe we do have to
represent that front end device as a consumer of channels provided
by the various ADCs (modulators here).

Other bits in the device here.
Digital filters.  Why do we need those in DT?  Aren't they software
controlled things and associate with a channel? Or are they representing
what I have as demodulators above.?

Given I think they end up in the backend we may need to extend some interfaces.

Anyhow, that probably confused anyone who previously had
any idea on how this all fits together.

Also, I should have gotten out my UK keyboard or changed keyboard layout.
US keyboard, with UK layout makes for tricky to find symbols for asci art :(
