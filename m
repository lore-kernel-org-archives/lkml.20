IIUC, pkvm_pgtable_stage2_map() only uses the hyp vCPU's pKVM memcache
(&vcpu->vcpu.arch.pkvm_memcache). I agree that this does not need to be
addressed in this series. However, there is also a desire to keep the CCA
and pKVM code paths similar by using helpers such as kvm_vm_is_protected().
Since an RMM can create a stage-2 mapping without a REC (vCPU), rejecting
pre-faulting for all protected VM configurations may be incorrect. I can
handle this in my series though.

I also want to point out that there are use cases for pre-faulting while
the VM is running.

It is not pKVM; it runs in Realm mode.

sure.

I will check this when I rebase my kernel onto this series.
