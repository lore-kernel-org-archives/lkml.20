selftests: can: add J1939 addressing and concurrency tests

This adds a kselftest for J1939 NAME-based addressing and address
claiming. It covers NAME bind and getsockname readback, the source
address on the wire, NAME-addressed transfers using a forged Address
Claimed, and address-claim conflicts. It also runs several concurrent
transport sessions as a stress check.

[Severity: Low]
setup() in the shared runner j1939_lib.sh also accepts a real CAN
device:

	else
		ip link set dev "$CANIF" type can bitrate "$BITRATE" || exit $ksft_skip
	fi

If CANIF points at a real bus with other J1939 nodes, what happens to an
ECU that already holds 0x50 or 0x90?

forge_address_claim() sends an Address Claimed from a CAN_RAW socket for
SA_RX (0x90) in name_addressing. It also sends one for SA_CLAIM (0x50)
with NAME_LOWER (0x00000000c0ffee00) in ac_conflict_lose, and
claim_addr() claims 0x50 too. A compliant ECU that sees a competing claim
with a lower NAME has to give up its address. The kernel follows the same
rule in j1939_ac_process().

Should these tests skip when CANIF is not a vcan? If not, could the
header comment and commit message at least mention this side effect?

[Severity: Medium]
Could this fixed 300 ms sleep make the tests flaky?

The kernel maps a newly claimed address only when the ECU's ac_timer
fires:

net/can/j1939/bus.c:j1939_ecu_timer_start() {
	...
	/* Schedule timer in 250 msec to commit address change. */
	hrtimer_start(&ecu->ac_timer, ms_to_ktime(250),
		      HRTIMER_MODE_REL_SOFT);
}

Until j1939_ecu_timer_handler() runs, j1939_name_to_addr() returns
J1939_IDLE_ADDR. j1939_ac_fixup() then fails with -EADDRNOTAVAIL on both
the src_name path and the dst_name path.

That leaves about 50 ms of slack. The soft hrtimer can be delayed, for
example when softirq work is pushed to ksoftirqd on a loaded VM, or on
debug or RT kernels. In that case the send after the sleep fails.

This affects the send in name_addressing and the final send in
address_claim_send. It also affects the baseline send_data() in
ac_conflict_probe(), so both ac_conflict_lose and ac_conflict_defend
would fail.

Would polling or retrying until a deadline be more robust here?

The comments also look inaccurate. ACLAIM_SETTLE_US is labelled
"empirical, not spec", but it has to be longer than the kernel's fixed
250 ms commit timer. The forge_address_claim() comment says it gives "the
kernel RX path a moment", but the sleep is really waiting for that timer.

[Severity: Low]
Every child sends the same payload here, because fill_pattern() uses only
the byte position:

	buf[i] = (uint8_t)(i ^ (i >> 8) ^ 0x3c);

send_recv_verify() only checks the length and runs memcmp() against that
same buffer.

Suppose a regression mixed up sessions. A wrong session lookup could
consume another session's TP.DT packets, or two receivers could get each
other's data. Would stress_concurrent_sessions still pass?

Adding a per-session byte to each payload (for example, one derived from
sa_tx) would make this kind of mixing visible.

[Severity: Low]
Is the header comment accurate? It says the transfer "reaches the socket
bound to that NAME". But the receiver is bound with J1939_NO_NAME, so
jsk->addr.src_name is 0.

As a result, j1939_sk_match_dst() skips the NAME branch:

net/can/j1939/socket.c:j1939_sk_match_dst() {
	...
	if (jsk->addr.src_name && skcb->addr.dst_name) {
		if (jsk->addr.src_name != skcb->addr.dst_name)
			return false;
	} else {
		...
		if (j1939_address_is_unicast(skcb->addr.da)) {
			if (jsk->addr.sa != skcb->addr.da)
				return false;
	...
}

The frame is delivered through the plain SA check instead.

The test does cover the TX side, where j1939_ac_fixup() resolves NAME_RX
to SA_RX. It never runs the RX-side NAME filter, though, so it would
still pass if that filter were broken.

Could the comment be reworded to match what is tested? Another option is
to bind the receiver to NAME_RX so the NAME match path runs as well.

[Severity: Low]
If fork() fails partway through this loop, what happens to the children
that were already forked?

ASSERT_GE() runs the fixture teardown and aborts the test, so the
waitpid() loop below is skipped. The earlier children are neither killed
nor reaped. They keep running TP sessions with rx and tx sockets bound to
0x20 + i and 0x40 + i. The harness kills the process group only on
timeout, in __wait_for_test().

They do exit on their own once J1939_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS and the TP timeouts
expire, so this only matters when the test has already failed. They
could still overlap with the next test on the same interface.

Should the forked children be killed and reaped before the test fails?
