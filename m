From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

HV_X64_MSR_REFERENCE_TSC is private to each Virtual Trust Level: the
secure kernel maps its own page from VTL1, as the normal kernel does
from VTL0. With one partition-wide MSR, VTL1 enabling its page replaced
VTL0's, and the normal kernel fell back to a TIME_REF_COUNT MSR read (a
VM exit) on every clock read.

The reference time behind the pages is one clock per partition, so
every page shows the same scale, offset and sequence. Keep the MSR per
plane, and have every masterclock update write the shared parameters
to every enabled page. A plane that enables its page while another
page is valid gets the current parameters at once, rather than an
update that invalidates every page for nothing. A host-side MSR
restore leaves the page alone, so a page migrated with the guest keeps
its contents.

The pages are guest-writable, so KVM never trusts what it reads back
from them; the TSC-emulation case below keeps such values away from
higher planes. A page is invalidated with a discrete zero-sequence write
before its body changes: the stores of one long copy are not ordered as
another vCPU sees them. The new sequence must also differ from the one
the page held, or a reader that sampled the old sequence accepts a torn
read across the rewrite. A host-side counter (hv_tsc_sequence) is not
enough for that. It is not migrated, so on a destination it restarts
below the sequence on the restored pages, and the first publish there
can repeat it. And under TSC emulation the pages carry a sequence the
guest wrote: VTL0 could stage a value on a higher plane's page and pump
recomputes, one MSR write at a time, until the counter reaches it. So
each update takes the highest of hv_tsc_sequence and every enabled
page's current sequence, plus one, skipping 0, 0xFFFFFFFF and any value
a page holds. The pages can push the sequence past their values but
never make KVM repeat one, and the choice needs no new migrated state.
When a plane enables its page while the parameters are valid, the
parameters go to that page alone, unless the page holds the current
sequence over a different body: then it takes the full update. A page
that already shows exactly the current contents is left alone.

Each page is written and read as the plane that owns it
(kvm_plane_write_guest(), kvm_plane_read_guest()), under that plane's
own memory attributes. A refused access costs only that plane: its page
is marked in a per-plane broken bitmap and KVM stops maintaining it,
leaving whatever it last held, until the plane writes its MSR again.
When the master clock is not TSC-based, no parameters can be computed
and every enabled page is left invalid, with its readers on the
TIME_REF_COUNT fallback, until a later clock update succeeds.

With HV_X64_MSR_TSC_EMULATION_CONTROL set (reenlightenment, restored
across migration), kvm_hv_setup_tsc_page() keeps the parameters it
reads back from the lowest enabled plane's page, with the reserved
field cleared, and invalidates any other page that does not match them.
That page is writable by the lowest VTL, so its contents must not become
a higher VTL's clock: a higher plane's TIME_REF_COUNT, synthetic timers
and timer message timestamps answer from kvmclock rather than from the
read-back parameters, and an MSR write in this state takes a full
update instead of being handed them. Without the first part, VTL0
could stage parameters on its own page, arm TSC emulation and wait for
any masterclock update (migration, KVM_SET_CLOCK, host suspend): KVM
would invalidate VTL1's page and leave the secure kernel reading a
TIME_REF_COUNT that VTL0 chose.
