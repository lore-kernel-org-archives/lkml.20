Thank you for the pointer. That review reached no list at all: not
linux-bluetooth, not devicetree, and not sashiko's own sashiko-reviews list=
,
which I checked over 31 August to 9 September. It exists only on the site, =
so
without you going to look we would not have known it was there.

One of its three findings is real, reproducible, and worse than it claims. =
I
have measured it rather than argued about it, and the fix is below. The oth=
er
two are at the end, more briefly.

A missed alive interrupt now costs the controller, not just the suspend
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

1/2 makes set_dxstate() return success when the register says the target st=
ate
was reached but the interrupt never arrived. That is correct about the
hardware and silent about data->alive_intr_ctxt, which only the interrupt
handler ever moves. So the tracker is left saying D0 after a suspend that
actually reached D3.

On resume the handler then runs with a stale D0 context while the hardware =
is
already heading to D0, takes neither branch, and sets neither signal_waitq =
nor
submit_rx. btintel_pcie_reset_ia() and btintel_pcie_start_rx() are the only
things that re-arm the RX rings, and nothing else on the resume path calls
them.

Measured with the same fixture as my 2 September matrix - one alive interru=
pt
dropped inside the handler, before it touches anything, which is the state =
a
genuinely missed one leaves:

  no injection      SP11RX: ctxt d3 -> d0, submit_rx=3D1     device unchang=
ed
  interrupt dropped SP11RX: ctxt d0 -> d0, submit_rx=3D0     ...then:

    Bluetooth: hci0: Received hw exception interrupt
    Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x0c01 tx timeout
    Bluetooth: hci0: Opcode 0x0c1a failed: -110
    btintel_pcie 0000:00:14.7: resetting

and the controller comes back as a new hci index. So it is not only that RX
stops: the firmware throws an exception, two HCI commands time out, the dri=
ver
FLRs it, and every paired device is gone until something re-pairs.

The fix
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Do in the fallback what the handler's branch would have done. It mirrors th=
e
handler's own call site, which also ignores start_rx()'s return:

Both halves are needed, and I only know that because setting the context al=
one
looked like a complete fix until I dropped the interrupt on the way up
instead:

  build                     drop on D3 entry        drop on D0 entry
  as posted                 wedged, FLR, new hci    -
  context only              clean                   wedged, FLR, new hci
  context + RX re-arm       clean, 3 of 3           clean, 3 of 3

Three cycles of each plus three controls: no "hw exception" and no "resetti=
ng"
in any of the nine, and the hci index never moved. One caveat about my own
instrument: I also counted HCI events during a scan after each resume, and =
one
*control* run returned zero with the device plainly healthy, so that counte=
r is
not trustworthy on its own. The exception and reset lines are what never
misfired.

What I propose to do
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Fold it into 1/2 and send the series as v2. My reasoning is that a fix for =
an
unmerged patch in the same series belongs inside it rather than on top, but=
 I
hold that loosely and a separate patch is just as easy if you prefer it for
review.

It changes Vladimir's logic rather than adding to it, so: Vladimir, say if =
you
would rather carry it yourself and I will hold. Otherwise I will send v2 in=
 a
day or two, unless Luiz would rather see it sooner.

The second finding, which I could not measure
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Moving data->gp0_received =3D false out of the retry loop means a late inte=
rrupt
from attempt N can satisfy wait_event_timeout() at the top of attempt N+1, =
and
"if (status) return 0;" has no hardware check behind it - the register re-r=
ead
1/2 adds sits on the timeout path only. So the function can report success
having just written wr_sleep_cntrl() and waited for nothing, right after th=
e
previous iteration read the hardware and found it *not* in the target state=
.

Real by reading, but unmeasured: my fixture drops interrupts and does not d=
elay
them, so I cannot produce a late one. Saying so rather than implying I test=
ed
it.

The third, which is pre-existing and not this series'
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D

set_dxstate() clears the GP0 cause with btintel_pcie_clr_reg_bits(), which =
is
a read-modify-write. BTINTEL_PCIE_CSR_MSIX_HW_INT_CAUSES looks
write-1-to-clear: the interrupt handler acknowledges it by writing back exa=
ctly
what it read. If so the call does the opposite of both halves of its job - =
it
writes 0 to GP0, which clears nothing, and 1 to whatever else was pending i=
n
that register, retiring HWEXP, GP1 or FWTRIG unserviced.

Neither patch touches that line, so it is not this series' business, but
someone at Intel may want it.

Thanks,
Sergey
