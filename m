Document the two new Landlock permission categories, introduced with ABI
12, in the userspace API guide, admin guide, trace-event guide, UAPI
comments, and kernel security documentation.

The kernel security documentation generalizes the existing per-object
access-rights framing into three restriction models (handled_access_*,
handled_permissions, scoped) and states criteria for choosing among
them, so future permission or scope additions have a documented place to
land.

Changes since v3:
https://patch.msgid.link/20260726161400.3010511-13-mic@digikod.net
- Document the new permissions as ABI 12.
- Name the documented audit blockers namespace.use and capability.use
  after their domains.
- Document handled_permissions, the four permission rule and denial
  events, effective no-ops, raw member values, namespace IDs, and
  audit-suppressed denials; add handled_permissions to the basic trace
  example.
- Describe the namespace creation and entry paths, and state that quiet
  denials stay trace-visible.
- Describe the quiet ruleset fields as suppressing audit records rather
  than logs, now that denials are also trace events.

Changes since v2:
https://patch.msgid.link/20260527181127.879771-10-mic@digikod.net
- Fix the CAP_BPF forward-compatibility example in
  Documentation/security/landlock.rst: rules allow-list, so describe a
  rule *allowing* CAP_SYS_ADMIN continuing to allow operations now
  gated by CAP_SYS_ADMIN || CAP_BPF (was worded as a rule "denying";
  suggested by Günther Noack).
- Drop the "category" jargon from the Capability rules and Namespace
  rules summaries in Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst and add
  capabilities(7) / namespaces(7) cross-references there, in the rule
  examples, and in the ABI restriction sections (suggested by Günther
  Noack).
- Reword LANDLOCK_PERM_NAMESPACE_USE as gating "acquisition of access
  to namespaces" (was "acquisition of namespace associations") and
  "allow using" (was "allow entering") specific namespace types, to
  match the _USE semantics covering creation, entry, and fd-reference
  (suggested by Günther Noack).
- Document the per-member audit quieting for the new permissions in the
  Capability and namespace restrictions section: the quiet_capabilities
  and quiet_namespace_types rule fields suppress the audit records of
  specific denied members (independently of the allowed members),
  require the permission to be handled, are member-granular, and should
  quiet only known-expected members, never a blanket set.
- Documentation/security/landlock.rst prose polish (suggested by
  Günther Noack):
  hyphenate "user-namespace-based"; reword the design-philosophy
  operation-set sentence; add an introductory paragraph to "Ruleset
  restriction models" (the ruleset denies by default, rules allow-list
  exceptions); split the per-object and per-category sections into
  shorter paragraphs and lead the per-category one with "Each
  LANDLOCK_PERM_* flag maps to its own rule type"; reframe the
  per-object new-operation/new-object-type text around object type
  (was "rule type") and tighten it.
- State the combined deny-by-default explicitly in
  Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst: when a domain handles both
  permissions, an operation is allowed only if each independently
  allows it (e.g. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) needs both CLONE_NEWNET and
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN allowed).
- Note that the open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE) / move_mount anonymous-mount
  bypass path requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN (typically obtained by first
  creating a user namespace).
- Add a concrete downstream-operations example to the per-category
  model in Documentation/security/landlock.rst (denying CAP_SYS_ADMIN
  blocks all admin operations such as mounts).
- Document that creating a non-user namespace always requires
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so when the domain handles LANDLOCK_PERM_CAPABILITY_USE
  a rule allowing CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed even when CLONE_NEWUSER is
  combined in the same unshare() call; only user namespace creation
  needs no capability rule.

Changes since v1:
https://patch.msgid.link/20260312100444.2609563-12-mic@digikod.net

The userspace API and security guides were revamped to match the v2
permission model: the previous chokepoints/gateways prose is replaced
with the per-object (handled_access_*) versus per-category
(handled_perm) framing, and a new Design philosophy section in the
security guide states Landlock's principle (data, processes, kernel
resources).

- Rename namespace_inum to namespace_id in audit field documentation
  to match the renamed audit field.
- Rename LANDLOCK_PERM_NAMESPACE_ENTER references to
  LANDLOCK_PERM_NAMESPACE_USE (companion change to the introducing
  commit), and enumerate the seven kernel paths it gates in the
  userspace API guide (membership via unshare/clone/clone3/setns; fd
  reference via open_tree/fsmount).
- Clarify that LANDLOCK_PERM_NAMESPACE_USE gates *acquisition* of
  namespace associations only (namespaces the process is already a
  member of when the domain is enforced are implicitly allowed) and
  that LANDLOCK_PERM_CAPABILITY_USE gates every exercise of a
  capability after the domain is enforced, regardless of how the
  capability was obtained.
- Document the rationale for accepting (rather than rejecting)
  unknown category member values in rule bodies: rejection would tie
  Landlock policy semantics to the running kernel's category-member
  set, making cross-kernel policies brittle.  Acceptance is fail-safe
  in both directions and lets a policy activate as written when a
  value becomes real on a future kernel.
- Replace handled_perm = 0 with a per-bit mask in the userspace API
  guide's ABI compat fall-through, so future ABI extensions adding
  new LANDLOCK_PERM_* bits do not get stripped on the path that
  drops the v10 bits.
- Add a bridging sentence in the per-category permissions section
  of Documentation/security/landlock.rst contrasting per-category
  permissions with per-object access rights: per-category gates the
  prerequisite operation itself rather than restricting specific
  operations on a single resource instance (suggested by Günther
  Noack).
- Disambiguate the orthogonality invariant in
  Documentation/security/landlock.rst from the UAPI scoped field
  ("all new scoped features" -> "all Landlock access controls";
  suggested by Justin Suess).
- Add an introductory paragraph in
  Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst contrasting
  LANDLOCK_PERM_CAPABILITY_USE with PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS: NNP is the
  broader mechanism that blocks privilege acquisition via execve(2),
  while CAPABILITY_USE restricts the exercise of capabilities the
  process already holds (including those gained via CLONE_NEWUSER,
  which NNP does not block); sandboxes typically set both
  (suggested by Justin Suess).
- Disambiguate "category": object-side uses "object type" / "resource
  kind"; "category" stays for the per-category permissions model.

   restrictions, because access within the same scope is already
   allowed based on ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_RESOLVE_UNIX``.
 
+Composability with user namespaces
+----------------------------------
+
+Landlock domain-based scoping and the kernel's user-namespace-based capability
+scoping enforce isolation over independent hierarchies.  Landlock checks domain
+ancestry; the kernel's ``ns_capable()`` checks user namespace ancestry.  These
+hierarchies are orthogonal: Landlock enforcement is deterministic with respect
+to its own configuration, regardless of namespace or capability state, and vice
+versa.  This orthogonality is a design invariant that must hold for all Landlock
+access controls.
+
+Design philosophy
+-----------------
+
+Landlock's goal is to restrict a sandboxed process's access to three kinds of
+resources: data (files, sockets, pipes), other processes (signals, ptrace), and
+kernel-internal resources whose use widens the kernel attack surface
+(capabilities, namespace types).  Each access right or permission gates one or
+more operations that grant such access; restricting the operations is how
+Landlock restricts the underlying access.
+
+When designing a new access control, identify the protected resource kind
+first (data, processes, or kernel-internal resources).  The operations to
+restrict follow from the protected resource, by identifying which kernel code
+paths grant access to the resource and at which place in the code the access to
+the resource can be gated.  Do not design a permission around
+"restrict the unshare(2) syscall" or similar mechanism-centric framings; design
+it around "restrict the process from acquiring access to namespace types" (the
+protected resource), letting the operation set follow.
+
+Ruleset restriction models
+--------------------------
+
+Landlock provides three restriction models that differ in how rules identify the
+resource being restricted.
+
+In general, the ``struct landlock_ruleset_attr`` specifies the operations to be
+denied by default under the enforced policy.  The *rules* added to the ruleset
+define the exceptions to these restrictions, allow-listing specific conditions
+under which these operations are still permitted.
+
+Per-object access rights (``handled_access_*``)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Per-object access rights control operations on a specific resource instance,
+identified in the rule key by a value drawn from an open-ended space: a file
+hierarchy referenced by ``parent_fd``, or a network port identified by its
+16-bit number.
+
+Each ``handled_access_*`` field declares a set of access rights, operations
+which are to be denied by default once the ruleset is enforced.
+
+The rule body declares which of the multiple distinct operations on that object
+instance are allowed (open, read, write, truncate; bind, connect).
+
+Operations are grouped by object type in the respective ``handled_access_*``
+field: a new operation on an existing type extends that field, and a new object
+type gets its own ``handled_access_*`` field.
+
+Per-category permissions (``handled_permissions``)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Per-category permissions control the process's exercise of category members,
+where the category is a small kernel-defined enumeration (a Linux capability
+number ``CAP_*``, a namespace type ``CLONE_NEW*``).  Unlike per-object access
+rights, which restrict specific operations on a single resource instance,
+per-category permissions gate the prerequisite operation itself (exercising a
+capability, acquiring access to a namespace), so gating it transitively covers a
+broad set of downstream operations (e.g. denying ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` blocks all
+admin operations such as mounts).
+
+These category members are the LSM-level access-control objects (the entities
+the process is authorized against) even though they are enum values rather than
+externally-instantiated kernel data structures.  Per-category permissions apply
+where the controlled operation collapses to "may the process use this category
+member at all" (use a capability; acquire access to a namespace), so the rule
+body lists which category members the process may exercise.
+
+Each ``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_*`` flag maps to its own rule type and covers every
+kernel path that exercises a member.  When a ruleset handles a permission, all
+uses of category members are denied unless explicitly allowed by a rule.
+
+Logging of a denied member can be suppressed at the same granularity as the
+restriction itself: per rule and per member.  A rule names the members whose
+denial should not be audited; suppression only affects the audit record, never
+the denial or its trace event, which reports ``logged=0``.  Suppression only
+applies when the layer owning the rule is the one that denied the member.
+
+See Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst for the concrete syscall paths
+covered by each permission.
+
+The category enum is owned by the corresponding kernel subsystem (capabilities,
+namespaces, etc.).  Userspace policy authors query category member availability
+via the relevant non-Landlock interfaces:
+
+* For capabilities: ``<linux/capability.h>``,
+  ``/proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap``, ``prctl(PR_CAPBSET_READ)``.
+* For namespaces: ``<linux/sched.h>``, ``/proc/$$/ns/*``,
+  :manpage:`unshare(2)` runtime probe.
+
+The Landlock ABI version does not encode this availability; ABI versioning
+describes which Landlock features (rule types, access rights, scopes,
+permissions) the kernel implements, not which category members the kernel knows
+about.
+
+Forward compatibility for new category members follows a simple rule set:
+
+* New members in future kernels are automatically denied: rules whitelist
+  specific values, and a member not in any rule is denied.
+* Kernel-side compatibility for split categories is handled by the owning
+  subsystem (e.g., when ``CAP_BPF`` was split from ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``, either
+  capability became sufficient for the affected operations, so a rule allowing
+  ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` continues to allow operations now gated by
+  ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN || CAP_BPF``).
+* Unknown values in the rule body are silently accepted rather than rejected.
+  Rejecting them would tie Landlock policy semantics to the running kernel's
+  category-member set: a rule built against future headers would fail to load
+  on older kernels, forcing policy authors to know each kernel's enumeration.
+  Acceptance is fail-safe in both directions: a rule referring to a value the
+  running kernel does not yet know has no effect (deny-by-default still applies
+  to that operation), and a rule written against future headers loads
+  identically across kernels so the same policy keeps the same restrictions.
+  When a value becomes real on a future kernel, the policy activates as written
+  by the author.
+* In contrast, unknown ``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_*`` flags in
+  ``handled_permissions`` are rejected (``-EINVAL``), since Landlock owns that
+  bit space.
+
+Cross-domain scopes (``scoped``)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Scopes restrict **cross-domain interactions** categorically, without rules.
+Setting a scope flag (e.g.  ``LANDLOCK_SCOPE_SIGNAL``) denies the operation to
+targets outside the Landlock domain or its children.  Like per-category
+permissions, scopes provide complete coverage of the controlled operation.
+
+Choosing a model for a new feature
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* If the new feature controls operations on resource objects supplied by the
+  sandbox author, extend or add a per-object access right
+  (``handled_access_*``).
+* If the new feature controls a per-category operation gated by an enum (a
+  Linux capability, a namespace type, a socket family, etc.), use a
+  per-category permission (``handled_permissions``).  When several such enums
+  could classify the operation, prefer the enum the originating subsystem
+  already
+  uses for capability/access checks (e.g. ``CAP_*`` for ``capable()`` hooks,
+  ``CLONE_NEW*`` for namespace hooks).
+* When an operation is gated by multiple kernel-defined enums (a classic
+  example being ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` plus a ``CLONE_NEW*`` flag for non-user
+  namespace creation), define one per-category permission per enum dimension.
+  Sandbox authors handle each dimension's permission in

+
+Capability and namespace restrictions
+-------------------------------------
+
+``handled_permissions`` declares per-category permissions: each permission
+selects which members of a kernel-defined category (CAP_* capabilities,
+CLONE_NEW* namespace types) the process may use.  Unlike per-object access
+rights (``handled_access_*``) or cross-domain scopes (``scoped``), per-category
+permissions constrain the sandboxed process's own use of these enums; members
+not allowed by a rule are denied by default.
+
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_NAMESPACE_USE`` gates *acquisition of access* to
+namespaces: creation via :manpage:`unshare(2)` / :manpage:`clone(2)`
+/ :manpage:`clone3(2)`, entry via :manpage:`setns(2)`, and fd-reference
+acquisition via :manpage:`open_tree(2)` / :manpage:`fsmount(2)`.  Namespaces
+the process is already a member of when the domain is enforced are implicitly
+allowed (the process could not continue running otherwise); rules describe
+which new namespace types the process may acquire.
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` gates every exercise of a capability
+after the domain is enforced, regardless
+of how the capability was obtained (inherited credentials, ``CLONE_NEWUSER``
+grant, ``setuid``/file-cap-bearing :manpage:`execve(2)`, etc.).  Configuring
+both together restricts what privileges are available *and* the namespaces in
+which they take effect, which matters because user namespace creation has no
+capability check and grants all capabilities within the new namespace: gating
+only one of the two leaves a kernel attack-surface widening path open.  When a
+domain handles both permissions, an operation is allowed only if each
+independently allows it: :manpage:`unshare(2)` with ``CLONE_NEWNET`` then
+requires both a rule allowing ``CLONE_NEWNET`` and a rule allowing
+``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``.
+
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` complements :manpage:`prctl(2)`
+``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`` but does not replace it.  ``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS``
+prevents privilege *acquisition* via :manpage:`execve(2)` (setuid, file
+capability xattrs, privilege-elevating LSM transitions) and is a prerequisite
+for unprivileged Landlock self-sandboxing.
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` restricts *exercise* of capabilities the
+process already holds, including those
+gained via ``CLONE_NEWUSER`` which ``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`` does not block.
+Sandboxes typically set both.
+
+Rules are added with ``LANDLOCK_RULE_CAPABILITY`` and &struct
+landlock_capability_attr (each rule lists ``CAP_*`` values to allow), and with
+``LANDLOCK_RULE_NAMESPACE`` and &struct landlock_namespace_attr (each rule
+lists ``CLONE_NEW*`` flags to allow).  Landlock is purely restrictive: it can
+only deny what the traditional check would have allowed, never grant additional
+privileges.
+
+Denials of specific capabilities or namespace types can be excluded from audit
+logging per rule, by listing them in the ``quiet_capabilities`` or
+``quiet_namespace_types`` field of the rule (independently of the allowed
+members).  Quieting requires the permission to be handled, is member-granular,
+and only suppresses the audit record of a denial attributed to the rule's own
+layer; it never changes the denial itself or suppresses its trace event, which
+reports ``logged=0``.  Sandboxes should quiet only specific members known to be
+requested but expected to be denied (for example for compatibility with older
+callers), never a blanket set: a blanket set follows the running kernel's known
+members and would hide surprising or future denials from audit.
+
+Rule bodies silently accept values unknown to the current kernel (capabilities
+above ``CAP_LAST_CAP``, unrecognised ``CLONE_NEW*`` bits): they have no runtime
+effect, so a rule compiled against future kernel headers loads without error on
+older kernels.  Future kernels gain new members denied by default until a rule
+explicitly allows them.
+
+The single ``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_NAMESPACE_USE`` bit gates every kernel path
+that grants the calling process access to a namespace of the controlled types,
+whether by becoming a member of the namespace or by holding a file descriptor
+that references it.  The covered syscall paths are:
+
+* :manpage:`unshare(2)` with ``CLONE_NEW*``: the caller becomes a member of a
+  newly-created namespace.
+* :manpage:`clone(2)` (or :manpage:`clone3(2)`) with ``CLONE_NEW*``: the
+  child becomes a member of a newly-created namespace.
+* :manpage:`setns(2)`: the caller becomes a member of an existing namespace
+  referenced by file descriptor.
+* :manpage:`open_tree(2)` with ``OPEN_TREE_NAMESPACE``: the caller obtains a
+  file descriptor referring to a newly-created mount namespace.
+* :manpage:`open_tree(2)` with ``OPEN_TREE_CLONE``: the caller obtains a file
+  descriptor referring to a newly-created anonymous mount namespace.
+* :manpage:`fsmount(2)` with ``FSMOUNT_NAMESPACE``: the caller obtains a file
+  descriptor referring to a newly-created mount namespace.
+* :manpage:`fsmount(2)` (default): the caller obtains a file descriptor
+  referring to a newly-created anonymous mount namespace.
+
+Anonymous mount namespaces (created by ``open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE)`` and the
+default :manpage:`fsmount(2)`) are intentionally covered by the bit even though
+the calling process does not become a member of them.  Without this coverage, a
+sandboxed process could combine ``open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE)`` with
+:manpage:`move_mount(2)` to graft mounts from a freshly-allocated mount
+namespace into its current namespace, bypassing a ``CLONE_NEWNS`` restriction
+(these mount operations require ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``, which a sandboxed process
+typically obtains by first creating a user namespace).
+
+In practice, unprivileged processes first create a user namespace (which
+requires no capability and grants all capabilities within it), then use those
+capabilities to create other namespace types.  All non-user namespace types
+require ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` for both creation and :manpage:`setns(2)` entry; mount
+namespace entry additionally requires ``CAP_SYS_CHROOT``.  For
+:manpage:`setns(2)`, capabilities are checked relative to the target namespace,
+so a process in an ancestor user namespace naturally satisfies them; this
+includes joining user namespaces, which requires ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``.  When
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` is also handled, each of these
+capabilities must be explicitly allowed by a rule.
+
+Creating a non-user namespace always requires ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``, and
+``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` (when handled) gates that check
+regardless of which user namespace it targets.  This is true whether the
+namespace is created
+on its own, combined with ``CLONE_NEWUSER`` in a single :manpage:`unshare(2)`
+call, or in a separate :manpage:`unshare(2)` call after a user namespace: in
+all cases the kernel checks ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` against the owning user
+namespace, and Landlock denies it unless a rule allows
+``CAP_SYS_ADMIN``.  Combining ``CLONE_NEWUSER`` with another ``CLONE_NEW*``
+flag therefore does not avoid the capability check; only user namespace
+creation itself needs no capability rule.
+
+When creating child user namespaces, it is recommended to also create a
+dedicated Landlock domain with restrictions relevant to each namespace context.
+
+Note that ``LANDLOCK_PERMISSION_CAPABILITY_USE`` restricts the *use* of
+capabilities, not their presence in the process's credential.  Capability sets
+can change
+after a domain is enforced through user namespace entry or :manpage:`capset(2)`;
+privileged sandboxes that did not set ``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`` may also gain
+capabilities through :manpage:`execve(2)` of binaries with file capabilities.
+In all cases, :manpage:`capget(2)` will report the credential's capability sets,
+but any denied capability will fail with ``EPERM`` when exercised.  Do not rely
+on :manpage:`capget(2)` to determine whether the policy permits a given
+capability; only the actual operation will return ``EPERM`` upon denial.
