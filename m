Not permanently revoked. In practice this would be, for example, a GPU-
exported dma-buf which is only available for p2p access which gets
evicted, or a system memory exported dma-buf that gets hit by a
shrinker and moved to swap. The exporter calls invalidate_mappings() to
notify importers that storage is going away. Importers need to call
map_attachment() to bring it back.

A typical GPU example: A GPU importer receives invalidate_mappings() on
an imported dma-buf. The dma-buf is still accessed by the GPU and thus
has a couple of dma-fences attached. The importer can't immediately
call dma_buf_unmap_attachment(). In fact, typically the easiest thing
for the importer is to call dma_buf_unmap_attachment() on the next gpu
command submission immediately followed by a dma_buf_map_attachment(),
but it can't guarantee that would happen within bounded time.

A well behaved importer would therefore currently have to schedule an
async worker or similar to wait for its dma-fences to signal and then
grab the resv lock from worker context and call
dma_buf_unmap_attachment().

A well-behaved exporter on the other hand, would have to wait for all
dma-fences to signal, then wait for all unmap_attachment() calls before
reclaiming.

TBH I'm not sure what the best solution is here, but the importer flow
doesn't fit well in a typical gpu command submission model IMO.

Thanks,
Thomas
