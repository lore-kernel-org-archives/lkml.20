I don't think this is needed. If using dirtyring, we don't need to allow 
user to set hdbss size: HDBSS size should be sized according to the 
dirty-ring dimensions, that are set by userspace before the first vcpu is 
created.

I still think we should do PAGE_SIZE for dirty-bitmap. Dirty ring should do 
based on the dirty-ring size, and maybe review the use of reserved 
entries, or it's accounting.

What do you think?

Thanks!
