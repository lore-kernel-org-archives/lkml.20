This series came out of testing a still in-works __arena support for
BPF_GCC and anomalies seen in the A/B reports.

BPF_GCC selftest builds reports a number of things that are not true.
 - Tests the compiler cannot build do not appear at all, so the
   report is silent about them
 - Others are compiled down to an empty body and report OK despite
   not even been executed
 - Two programs that fail to verify take four unrelated tests down with
   them, because everything in that object is loaded together.
 - Unconditional gating on __clang__ when newer GCC support for those
   is coming online.

Only 7/8 needs the in-works arena support to be exercised at all; the
rest are measured below with a stock bpf-gcc.  Nothing in the series
changes what clang emits.

What each patch does, and what it measurably changes.  Numbers are
test_progs on bpf-next with a stock bpf-gcc:

 1/8: Gate the callx tests on CAN_USE_CALLX, which also accepts a GCC
      defining __BPF_FEATURE_CALLX.
   -> 79 subtests newly visible, 78 OK and one @unpriv SKIP; the two
      dummies retire; callx_rodata_lskel SKIP -> OK.

 2/8: Keep clang-only warning flags out of GCC builds.

 3/8: Add __skip_without_arena, and give each arena guard an #else
      dummy carrying it.
   -> 7 subtests newly visible, all SKIP; arena_kfunc_jit OK -> SKIP.

 4/8: Make arena_base() opaque to GCC's -Warray-bounds, behind
      #ifdef __clang__ since clang does not warn.
   -> no verdict change.  +35 insns over 20 call sites under GCC;
      clang output unchanged, bit for bit.

 5/8: Tag the tests whose body dereferences an arena pointer, and only
      those; drop the in-body guards.
   -> 13 subtests OK -> SKIP, check_arena_arg_ret FAIL -> SKIP, and
      verifier_arena itself FAIL -> OK.  The rest now actually run.

 6/8: Cast explicitly with bpf_addr_space_cast() in the arena subprog
      and callback faults, as the sibling tests already do.
   -> 15 FAIL -> OK, and 5 subtests newly visible.

 7/8: Write the mixed arena/scalar ALU tests in asm, rather than a
      volatile register variable GCC may optimise away.
   -> not exercised by a stock bpf-gcc.

 8/8: trigger() in the four struct_ops arena progs is guarded in-body
      and test_loader does not drive them, so the tag cannot reach
      them; use the flag-in-.data pattern from linked_externs.c.
   -> 2 tests stop reporting a vacuous OK.  The other two need a
      testmod BTF carrying the arena tag, so are unreached here.

Totals for the series.  Nothing regresses:

  FAIL  472 -> 456        OK -> FAIL regressions:  0
  OK   7061 -> 7141
  SKIP  753 ->  779

Two things worth re-iterating explicitly:

 - 1/8 needs a GCC defining __BPF_FEATURE_CALLX, in bleeding-edge
   but not released yet.

 - 7/8, needs a GCC with arena support; that work is coming along
   but not yet ready for public review.

v1 -> v2:

 - 1/8: the __skip() reason named only x86/arm64 while CAN_USE_CALLX
   also accepts riscv64.  Say "arch JIT" instead of listing them, so
   the string cannot go stale the next time an arch is added.  (bot)
 - 3/8: jit_insns_arena.c was missed.  Both of its programs are inside
   the guard, so without arena support the object has none at all and
   RUN_TESTS(jit_insns_arena) ran zero subtests without saying so.
   (bot)
 - 5/8: commit message only.  It cited arena_types to argue the kfunc
   tests need no cast, but the address parameters carry the __ign
   suffix, so get_kfunc_arg_type() returns ARG_IGNORE and
   check_func_arg() returns before any register type check.
   Conclusion unchanged, for a better reason.  (bot)
 - 5/8: arena_kfunc.c, verifier_arena_globals1.c and
   verifier_arena_globals2.c had the same empty-body shape and were
   missed; nine more guards go and seven more tags arrive.
   arena_kfunc.c alone had eight subtests reporting a vacuous OK.
 - 8/8: new patch, for the four struct_ops arena progs.

The three bot findings prompted a sweep of every prog with an arena
guard, which is where the last two came from.  The totals above were
re-measured on the series as posted.

v2 -> v3:

 - Rebased on bpf-next.
 - 1/8: the bot asked about data_in_arena.c, whose use_ops() gated an
   indirect call on __clang__ with no arch condition.  That file has
   since gone in 3c13b2e5a40e ("selftests/bpf: Remove tests for global
   data in arena"), so nothing is left to convert.  The missing word in
   the commit message is fixed.  (bot)
 - 7/8: the comment on the r9 load said it was what makes libbpf record
   the arena, which stopped being true with cd7a395838cb ("libbpf: Bind
   the arena of an object to every program in it").  The load is now
   only a fallback for a kernel without fd_array_cnt and for the light
   skeleton; say that instead.  (bot)
