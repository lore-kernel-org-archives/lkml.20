There's

https://sources.debian.org/src/e2fsprogs/1.47.4-1/misc/e4crypt.c?hl=568#L568

which bemoans that:
	 * The fact that the keyctl system call and the add_key system
	 * call treats KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING differently when a
	 * session keyring does not exist is very unfortunate and
	 * confusing, but so it goes...

Near as I can tell, add_key just always uses KEY_LOOKUP_CREATE?

And https://sources.debian.org/src/krb5/1.22.1-3/src/lib/krb5/ccache/cc_keyring.c?hl=307#L307

I'm not sure whether previous kernels did that, or whether the authors
mixed up testing with and without KEY_LOOKUP_CREATE.
