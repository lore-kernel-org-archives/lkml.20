I understand that section 12.1.3 describes how software can guarantee
completion of a memory-mapped GIC write. With an nGnRE mapping, if the
GICR_ISPENDR0 writes must complete before gic_ipi_send_mask() returns, a
read-back from each target Redistributor is needed.

What I am trying to understand is whether completion at this point is an
architectural requirement for this particular write, or a requirement of
Linux's ipi_send_mask() interface.

I could not find an explicit completion requirement for ipi_send_mask()
itself. The normal GICv3 path also appears to return after an ISB,
without the DSB described in section 12.1.6 as necessary to guarantee
that the associated Redistributor has observed the write. This is why I
am unsure what completion guarantee is required here.

More specifically, I would like to understand:
- What could an outstanding IPI request race with?
- Which component must have observed the request before
  gic_ipi_send_mask() returns: the CPU interface, the sending PE's
  Redistributor, or the target Redistributor?

A pointer to the relevant architectural requirement or an example of
such a race in Linux would help me understand why completion is needed
here.

Thanks,
Kohei
