I'll apply this.

And thanks for addressing that and sorry for nitpicking. Looks good to
me and thanks for addressing the bug. This is kind of AI assisted commit
to works for me; and I believe that checks are balances are in place.

Not everyone gets this, and the problem is that they also in effect
reduce the number of point of failures from two to one due
ignorance-by-a-choice.

A person submitting an AI-assisted patch is also a reviewer, and
ignoring this increases the probability of bad getting into mainline
quite literally.

I think some people might not really understand this at all but is
just that it is much less likely that two people get a patch wrong
and at the same time, than just one. That's it ;-)

This is not an AI/LLM problem. It is a misconduct by people quite
well scoped really...

Sorry for the rant just wanted to write this down and get this out
of my chest. Absolutely nothing to do with this patch.

Br, Jarkko
