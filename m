No worry, nobody knows everything from the beginning, and we all learn from
mistakes.

That makes sense, thank you for sharing the context.

That's the right way.  Nonetheless, disclosing this kind of information is very
helpful.  Particularly nowadays, use of AI-like tools is nearly always better
to disclose.  It is not because maintainers hate AI.  It is because AI-like
tools are still something new that sometimes good but also do mistake, and
therefore maintainers are still learning the tools.  I'd suggest disclosing
this kind of context in your future contexts, not only for DAMON, but for
kernel works in general.

Makes sense.  So I think this is not DAMON implementation problem.  Tools
should aware this and do not try refreshing when the kdamond is terminated, or
remember old snapshot.

If this behavior is not documented, that's documentation issue that we shold
fix.  Please feel free to send a patch for documenting, if you don't mind.  If
DAMON user-space tool is not aware of this and give users unexpected results,
please feel free to send a PR for fixing it, if you don't mind.

Ok, that makes sense.  Thank you for letting me know this.  So, this is a
behavior that changed from that of the past.  But I still feel the current
behavior is not a real problem.  In a sense, if the kdamond is terminated, it
has no region and therefore showing no region makes sense to me.  Please let me
know if I'm missing something or you have other opinions.

No worries.  I'm also sorry if you felt you are suspected or not welcomed.  I
believe now we are all good and you are welcomed.  Thank you for kindly
answering all my questions.


Thanks,
SJ
