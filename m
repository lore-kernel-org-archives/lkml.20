It's clear there *was* a reason, but I don't know either.  Maybe
Matthew will remember?

I don't object from a PCI standpoint, but Rafael generally takes care
of acpi/pci_root.c.  I would again suggest putting some of the commit
log detail below "---" and relying on the https://patch.msgid.link/
tag Rafael adds.
