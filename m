From my point of view, the first commit is the one that introduces the bug. The second commit comes along assuming the existing code is right. That is why I didn't tag the second one even though the second one is easier to trigger than the first one.

With additional thought after my email, I realized that my statement 
isn't quite correct. So invalidating the partition handing the CPUs back 
to its rightful parent may not be right. A simpler way to handle this is 
to keep the status quo and return an error to the users instead.
