I think this one is the crux. See more below.

Then let me ask the other way around, what is the benefit of having
the manufacturer?=20

There is now one central place for the fixups. Good. But now there
is that catch-all thing, which is the replacement for the former
manufacturer fixup if I read your code correctly.

BUT. We don't have a concept of a 'manufacturer'. We don't match the
manufacturer id. The manufacturer is just set as an additional
information if there is already  matching entry for a specific
flash, so we already know the exact part. Before the generic driver,
this might have made sense. The intention was to have a common place
for the default flags for all *known* flashes of a manufacturer
(which probably also was the result of the core rewrite). But now,
we might have flashes we do not know, that is, aren't in the
database. At least I would assume, that the manufacturer fixups are
still applied though. There were already a few different times I
proposed to have fixups for SNOR_ID(vendor_id).

I mean, even you fell into the trap that you'll have to have that
catch-all/fallback entry in the flash db (can't find the mail
anymore though, so please correct me if I'm wrong).

Also, having the fixups separate from the flash db, we can use the
generic flash driver and still have some fixups for given flashes.
If - for example - one would be adding locking support later,
nothing but the new flashdb entry has to be added as the fixups are
still applied.

The signature of the function is:
static const struct flash_info *spi_nor_match_id(struct spi_nor *nor,
						 const u8 *id)

Clearly it will return a pointer to the flash_info entry for a given
id. But as a side effect it also sets nor->manufacturer. What if I'd
call that twice with different ids? Maybe it's just me, but it looks
like a pure function but isn't. I probably got burnt by the generic
nor driver which hit that in the first place.

I don't get that. You already have a (new) winbond_fixups[] for
example. What is the difference between having that set in
spi_nor_manufacturer vs having that in a

winbond_init() {
	spi_nor_register_flash_devices(&winbond_nor_parts);
	spi_nor_register_fixups(&winbond_fixups);
}

And probably setting the manufacturer name in winbond_nor_fixups().

I guess that all falls apart because of the empty match entry. That
could be replaced with the SNOR_ID(winbond_id), though. Then we have
*real* per manufacturer fixups.

That is basically what commit afe1ea1344bb ("mtd: spi-nor: add
support for Macronix Octal flash") made.

See above.

I can do that myself, but I'd like to avoid any code churn. So I
don't know what you've already tried to come up with, but if there
is something which somewhat goes in the right direction of moving the
registration to a function inside of the vendor modules. That would
really be appreciated.

Looks like I need to apply the patches to the tree, too. Honestly,
I've never done that, so I first need to actually see how it's done
and if I even have access to the tree.

The flags actually serve the purpose of *not* having a huge amount
of different fixup functions. So these should be kept for now. As an
alternative, with the new list it might be possible to have multiple
fixups for the same flash part. In any case, the fixup_flags have to
be removed from the flash_info struct.

Ah I see, you actually *want* that extra bytes, in that case, please
use strstarts().

Ah, I now get what you want to try to achieve. Only the first three
bytes (I missed that in the function doc) are shared. So no actual ID
collision.

> For the other chip we can just give more ID bytes for the match.

Giving there are more IDs for the n25q00a.

> So I believe there is no problem here?

Yes, no problem. But use strncmp() here, because this actually
matches just one particular flash.

FWIW I don't think this is sustainable, though. It's basically a
workaround for the different matching in spi_nor_match_id() (first
entry wins) and the fixups ID matching (any matching entry is
applied). Though, I can't think of a more generic solution for now.
