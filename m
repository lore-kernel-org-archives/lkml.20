TBH this looks like a micro-optimization so I'm not expecting the
performance gains to justify the behavior change.

We already pass a stage-2 MMU configuration to EL2 from EL1 in nVHE and
hVHE. How is this any different?

I'm not opposed to making features VHE-only, but there needs to be some
amount of reasoning to justify it.

I'm not following your reasoning here. Treat the shadow stage-2 MMU as a
TLB; that TLB is filled with a writable translation when S2AP[1]=1 in the
L1 translation.

The dirty state of the pseudo-TLB is completely internal. You could then
layer HAFDBS for the L1 translation on top of this (which we don't
support) by potentially relaxing the descriptor _before_ evaluating the
resulting permissions. You'd then take write permission faults to set
S2AP[1] in the L1 translation.

This thing probably should've been "kvm_has_vcpu_feature()" or similar to
massage the expected typing.

Thanks,
