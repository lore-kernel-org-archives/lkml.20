Consistency check prevents malicious userspace VMMs from lying to the KVM about
some host state clobbering if KVM uses guest_cpu_cap_has() to management the state
for TDX in the future.

... Yes, this was my concern.
If in the future KVM adds new guest_cpu_cap_has() for a host state clobbering
feature and it is used TDX, it would cause problem if there is a mismatch between
guest_cpu_cap_has() and the real value exposed to the TD.
