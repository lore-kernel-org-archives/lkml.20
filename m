In my attempt to fix AI reported issues, I combined several changes
without explaining their individual purposes clearly enough. I'll split
the patch and simplify the explanations.

I included Fixes because this is a measured regression rather than a
general optimization. We observed the SuperBench workload regress
between 6.8 and 7.0 and bisected it to 209954cbc7d0. That commit stopped
clearing outgoing mm_cpumask bits at context-switch time and moved their
removal into the native flush callback, which successful Hyper-V
hypercalls bypass. More details on this in my reply to Michael Kelley in 
this thread.

I understand that you don't want this backported, but if this changes
anything, please let me know.

They are separate from the reported regression. The native path
explicitly bypasses this predicate during global ASID transitions,
and its callbacks can switch CPUs still using a local ASID to the
mm's global ASID.

A Hyper-V flush hypercall does not run those callbacks. I added the
guard to preserve that handling when reusing the native predicate.

The missing fallback predates this patch. I'll separate it for review
and explain the reason. I have not runtime-tested the transition case.

Yes, that is the intended condition. The filtered mask contains no CPU
other than the current CPU, or is empty.

The purpose was to avoid a Hyper-V hypercall when there are no remote
targets, and to request native mask cleanup at that point. The comment
doesn't explain that clearly enough. I'll fix it.

The argument 'info' is const. The copy lets this call request trimming 
without modifying the caller's request.

Yes. It makes the native predicate select stale, non-lazy members so
their callbacks can clear their own mask bits. The intent was to avoid
waiting for periodic trimming before later flushes can use the local
fast path.

Agreed. Having a second trimming decision in the Hyper-V backend is
awkward. I'll separate this cleanup optimization from target filtering
so we can review the policy independently.

I tested this as a replacement for the Hyper-V forced-trim block on a
32-vCPU Hyper-V VM, retaining the native fallback for
info->trim_cpumask. With three remote readers, mm_users was 4, while
the mask weight remained at 26–32, including 22–28 lazy memberships.

For ordinary flushes, trimming skips lazy CPUs. The comparison stayed
true across 10,000 flush requests, and each reader received 10,000
remote callbacks. The current patch used Hyper-V hypercalls instead
in the corresponding test.

I agree with centralizing the decision, but the raw comparison can
keep requesting cleanup while lazy memberships keep the condition
true. A 2x threshold would still trigger for these observed counts.

For Hyper-V it does select native callbacks rather than a flush
hypercall. The native predicate still skips lazy CPUs, though, so it
does not mean unconditional IPI delivery.

I'll revisit the name as part of the separate cleanup patch, once
the intended policy is settled.

I can use the wrapper and explain its role.
I'll also break this patch into a series.

Thanks for reviewing.
