I've been staring at the before and after code for a bit now.
It does even more than I was thinking :)  But I was trying to
detail the changed behavior (from userspace's pov), and after
several attempts, it seems maybe there actually isn't any.

Q: is there any path whereby the 

```
        else if (test_bit(KEY_FLAG_UID_KEYRING,
                                    &ctx.cred->session_keyring->flags) &&
                           lflags & KEY_LOOKUP_CREATE) {
```

case can still happen?  Or was this the only place where we installed
the user_session keyring as session keyring, so that we can drop this
branch?
