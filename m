The rules is well known. An old libfdt version will strip the tag and
downgrade the version. If, when we define a new tags this rules cannot be
follow by olf libfdt version, last_comp_version_w will be set to protect
against modification.

Maybe the problem is just downgrading the version.

Instead of downgrading it could be better if we mark the dtb "one or more
'unknown' tags have been removed due to a write by an old libfdt version" ?

We have a dt_flags header field. We can dedicate one bit for this marker.

Could it make sense ?

The use case we want to support (initially mentioned by Rob) can be summarize
in the following.

Assume:
 - bootloader: supported version 2.0
 - kernel: supported version 3.0
 - dtb version 3.0: New tags, skippable but unknown in version 2.0

The bootloader has to modify the dtb version 3.0. I has to add nodes such as
'choosen', 'memory', 'reserved-memory', plus probably modify some others
properties (usual fixup() stuff).

Then it passes this dtb to the kernel.

This bootloader (version 2.0) will encounter unknown tags. We don't want the
bootloader stops in that case and we just want him to do the best it can do
ending to pass the dtb to the kernel.

Indeed, if this bootloader writes a property with an unknown related tag, it
has to handle this unknwon related tag (rules already exposed).

When the dtb version 3.0 has defined new tags, the rules related to
modification performed are well known and several thinks can be done to avoid
the old bootloader applying modification rules.
- The tag is not skippable
  Game over for the old bootloader, an error is reported if the tag is found
- last_comp_version_w
  Game over for the old bootloader, modification not allowed.

In that case, the only solution is to bump the bootloader version.

If the version mandate some tags on nodes and properties, last_comp_version_w
will be used to block old bootloaders. They are not more allowed to modify the
dtb. They need to be bumped to newer versions.
