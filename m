Thank you for confirming and the tips!

Thank you for clarifying.  Yes, it may have a union with a type field.

Thank you for clarifying.  I agree this kind of information will be needed, and
I will make sure it is in the report struct.

Good point.  I will try to make it at least easy to debug.

Design is still in progress, but definitely this should be covered.  Thank you
for calling out!

Appreciate your continued support, that will be super helpful!
