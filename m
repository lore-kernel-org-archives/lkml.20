Hi Jerome,

Thanks for the review, and sorry for some delay. There was a lot to dig
into here.

Aaah, ROUND_RATE would be lovely except ... the firmware implementation
has a giant "TBD" / "error: not supported" instead :(

If there are major must-haves (or, very-nice-to-haves) in this firmware
API, I can see if we can get them added, but that's usually easier on
not-yet-launched products, whereas Pixel 10 is more than a year old
already. I'll see what's possible though.

I'd have to do a little more research to be sure to what extent the
firmware actually changes any of these behind the scenes. I'd imagine
that for the only divider-exposed clock (DP), it probably doesn't, but
I'm not sure at the moment.

I get your point though; it's certainly not beautiful, and may be
difficult or impossible to maintain in general.

I'll try to do some more sharing similar to what you're suggesting. But
full disclosure: the similarities are still somewhat rare in general.
Within a given service (so in this case, you're talking about
CPM_COMMON_LPCM_SERVICE, used by clock, reset, and *part* of pmdomain),
the protocol is largely shared.

But this series also touches CPM_COMMON_LPB_SERVICE (also in pmdomain)
and hints at some CPM_COMMON_PMIC_SERVICE support (RTC and PMIC); and
there are at least 5 more defined servies, as well as a few other
bespoke protocols. Those each have distinct request and response/status
encodings. (Unfortunately.)

So, I'll try to consolidate what I can, but it probably won't go super
far.

As mentioned above, round-rate is a no-go :(

I also don't see any way to query firmware for supported rates. Off the
top of my head, the best I can come up with is sweeping through rates
on SET_RATE and guessing, until we find something that doesn't return
INVALID_ARGS...

I also do not think topology description is possible with any existing
firmware. I would think if we were revisiting how to do this more
sanely, it would make sense to stop exposing the topology at all, but
TBD.

Anyway, thanks for your thoughts. I'll see what I can do about
ROUND_RATE, but also am interested in your opinion on the best way
forward with the existing firmware API.

For some positive notes:

The vast majority of these clocks do not actually support multiple rates
(at least, not in the tables here), nor do they expose any topology. So
I think I can just remove their rate table, and only rely on
(1) GET_RATE or
(2) SET_RATE, which will only succeed if you get the exact supported rate.

On some other clocks that support multiple rates (e.g.,
HSIOS_MPHY_REF_TCX0_CLK), I don't believe we ever need clk_set_rate().
We only use clk_get_rate(). So, probably same story as the 1-rate
tables.

A few others (DSI0/DSI1) seem to never use any get/set_rate operations,
at least on any Pixel drivers. So that probably can also be omitted.

I think that _only_ leaves DP clocks.

All in all, maybe I can strip a lot of this down quite a bit, and work
on DP separately.

Brian
