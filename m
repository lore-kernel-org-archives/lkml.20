Right, we have two source for poisoned page information, today.

1) LINUX_EFI_POISONED_MEMORY: Used to track memory block that got
   poisioned, and will be passed around during kexec.
2) PG_hwpoison on struct page: Used by the memory subsystem to avoid
   touching it.

And I understand that this design is fine, and we want to be easy to
identify what we are querying on function name. For instance,
I understand you confusion in range_contains_poisoned_memory() came
from:

range_contains_poisoned_memory():
   * What the caller reads: 
	* "is any memory in this range hardware poisoned?"
   * What actually runs:
	* "is any bit set in an EFI table that a PREVIOUS kernel wrote,
	   at 2 MiB granularity, for this memory region?"

So, I think think this is a naming issue, and I need to think more about
it. Maybe appending efiposioned (on data that is coming from EFI config
table). Let me think more about it.

Because the counter has to agree with the page flag, and the page flag is
not the bitmap.

PG_hwpoison in a block is the union of every source that poisoned a
frame; the inherited EFI table is one of them, and it is the coarse and
partial one.

You might ask why I do not just count the bits set in the bitmape and
multiply by the frames a unit covers.

That was my first try. It over-counts: a bit stands for a whole 2M unit,
but only the frames that reach __free_pages_core() get flagged -- CMA
comes back through __free_pages(), the initrd and __init memory through
free_reserved_pages(), and KHO-preserved frames never get an initialised
struct page at all.

And the over-count cannot be undone later. 

If the walk itself is what bothers you, the way out is not the bitmap
but counting as we flag: hwpoison_boot_page() already knows the pfn, so
it can bump a per-block-id counter in a small memblock array that
memblk_nr_poison_init() then just reads.

Exact by construction, no walk. Happy to go that way instead if you
prefer it.
