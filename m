Right, 
My reasoning is that we can discuss this new version, and make the needed 
changes, so Tian could pick this for his own patch series for the next 
version. I do not intend to get this merged by itself.

Next time I will make sure to state this in the cover letter so it's clear.

Sorry, this is my viewpoint after re-reading the documentation and 
being really pedantic while trying to get a proper answer from the people 
responsible for keeping/improving it.

I agree that it could work, and my first version was based on that.

But looks weird to me that we have to decide the writable bit based on 
having a feature enabled.

Take in account that we can only have DBM being the writable bit while 
HAFDBS is enabled (not only present), and that it is just enabled during 
dirty-tracking. 

It means we would need to convert the whole pagetable between DIRTY=S2AP[1] 
and DIRTY=DBM every time we enable or disable dirty-tracking.

My suggestion with this series is to have WRITE=DIRTY=S2AP[1] at all 
times, and have DBM to act as a "can be promoted to writable on write" bit.
This way we don't actually need to convert between encodings, and it still 
works and complies with the architecture.

Humm, and would not that work with the above suggested approach?
I mean, bit 7 (Dirty, S2AP[1]) will both mean WRITE/DIRTY, but it will be 
able to get promoted (nonW->W, or clean->dirty) based on the indirect 
permissions.

What do you think?

Thanks for reviewing,
Leo
