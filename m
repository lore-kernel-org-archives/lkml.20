In this scenario, do you still have reasonable steal time or no?

I read this as tunable problem of low,high thresholds to adjust
preferred_mask same as high capacity cores. No?

What i don't understand is.
- if there is no system pressure to use those low capacity cores, why
   not use them if the task util fits its capacity. If the task utilization
   doesn't, it won't land on them anyways today right?
