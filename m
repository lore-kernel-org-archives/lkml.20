v2->v3:
- Patch 1 is Amir's, it adds fsync=relaxed. Only an overlay with that
  syncs just what was written through it, everybody else syncs the whole
  upper file system as before. fsync=auto, the default, picks relaxed if
  the upper file system supports RENAME_WHITEOUT. (Amir)
- Dropped the fake inodes and the calls in the ovl_do_*() helpers,
  patches 7 to 9 of v2. Upper inodes without an overlay inode are left
  to ->sync_fs() and the block device, like in v1. (Amir)

v1->v2:
- Dropped the superblock flag and the ext4, xfs and btrfs patches. This
  is all in overlayfs now and works the same on any upper file system.
  (Christoph, Amir)
- Upper inodes without an overlay inode get a fake one that goes on the
  dirty list, patches 7 to 9.
- The periodic flusher pass doesn't write the upper inode any more, and
  syncfs() doesn't make ext4 commit per inode.
- Record write errors in s_wb_err of the overlay.
- Make the root inode appear hashed so it can be on the dirty list,
  don't mark unhashed inodes dirty, read i_writecount with acquire.
  (Sashiko)
- Left alone: dirtied_time_when isn't set for an overlay inode that gets
  I_DIRTY_TIME from ->write_inode(). It only matters for the 12 hour
  expiry, where the upper file system writes the timestamps on its own.
  (Sashiko)
- Rewrote my commit messages. (Christoph)

What it does now:

sync_filesystem() writes every inode on a dirty list, calls ->sync_fs()
and writes the block device. Only the first step is expensive, because
of other people's data. With fsync=relaxed overlayfs writes the upper
inodes whose overlay inode was marked dirty and does the other two steps
as they are.

Whiteouts and the work directories have no overlay inode, so nobody
writes those inodes. That's fine if ->sync_fs() or the block device gets
all metadata to disk, which is what relaxed asks of the upper file
system.

Things I know about:

 - ext4 without a journal supports RENAME_WHITEOUT, so it gets relaxed.
   It's fine there, its metadata is in the buffers of the block device,
   which we write. I tested it like the others.
 - f2fs, ubifs, fuse and tmpfs get relaxed as well and I didn't test
   them. ubifs_sync_fs() doesn't write dirty inodes, so a chmod of the
   work directory at mount time waits for the flusher there.
 - A default mount shows fsync=relaxed or fsync=on in /proc/mounts now.
 - Tracking isn't free. A chown -R that copies up 2000 files got 2-10%
   slower and the rm -rf after it 1-4%.

The testing is the same as for v1, now also on ext4 without a journal.
syncfs() goes from 220-275ms to 43-54ms and unmount from 119-238ms to
36-43ms on those four. ext2 with [2] applied falls back to fsync=on
and does exactly what it did before. fstests with -overlay gives the
same results with and without the series on ext4 and on xfs, apart from
overlay/019 on ext4 and generic/733 and generic/751 on xfs, which are
flaky either way.

Hello,

This picks up Chengguang Xu's "implement containerized syncfs for
overlayfs", last posted as RFC V6 in November 2021 [1].

syncfs() on an overlay and unmounting one call sync_filesystem() on the
upper file system, so they write every dirty inode on it no matter who
dirtied it. We run a lot of containers on one upper file system, and
stopping one of them writes out the dirty data of all the others. That
can take a very long time, and s_umount of the upper file system is held
the whole time, so anything that wants it exclusively queues up and then
everybody else queues up behind that.

With this an overlay only writes the upper inodes that were changed
through it, and then has the upper file system commit its metadata.

The V6 discussion ended with a direction but no V7, so that's what I
tried to follow:

 - V6 kept every overlay inode with an upper inode dirty for good. Jan
   and Amir didn't like the cost of walking them. Now an overlay inode
   is marked dirty when the upper inode is changed, mostly from
   ovl_copyattr() as Amir and Miklos suggested.
 - It never looks at the dirty flags of the upper inode, Miklos pointed
   out that they're cleared when writeback starts.
 - ->write_inode() goes through write_inode_now() on the upper inode,
   and keeps the overlay inode dirty while the upper inode is open for
   writing, which covers shared mappings.
 - V6 marked the inodes DONTCACHE, which Jan was worried about. This
   goes back to the v5 patch that keeps dirty overlay inodes cached.

One thing is new. V6 called wait_sb_inodes() on the upper file system to
catch writeback that was started but not finished, which waits for
everybody's writeback. Instead ->write_inode() keeps the overlay inode
dirty while the upper inode has pages tagged dirty or under writeback.
The tags don't have the problem the inode flags have, the writeback tag
is set before the dirty tag is cleared. So a clean overlay inode means
its data is on disk, and syncfs() only waits for its own inodes.

That takes care of the data. Metadata is harder, a lot of what is
changed on the upper file system has no overlay inode that could be on
the dirty list: the root of the overlay isn't hashed, and whiteouts,
index entries, the work directories and their parent have none. File
systems that log their metadata don't care, ->sync_fs() commits it. ext2
does, there a whiteout was gone after a crash. I first had overlayfs
write all of those itself and kept finding more of them, the last one
was the link count of the shared whiteout when a whiteout is removed.

So patch 1 adds a superblock flag, SB_I_OVL_USE_SYNC_FS, by which a file
system says that ->sync_fs() commits all of its metadata, and patches 2
to 4 set it for ext4 with a journal, xfs and btrfs. Without the flag on
the upper file system nothing changes, no inode is marked dirty and
syncfs() and unmount call sync_filesystem() like they always did.

Patches 5, 7, 8 and 10 are Chengguang's with changes noted in them,
patches 6 and 9 are new. I dropped Jan's Reviewed-by tags from V6 since
the patches changed.

lazytime on the upper file system needs its own handling. The flusher
leaves the timestamps in memory for up to 12 hours, so the overlay inode
can't be clean, but it can't stay dirty and pinned for that long either.
Patch 9 gives it I_DIRTY_TIME like the upper inode has, and forwards
->sync_lazytime() to the upper inode.

Things I know about:

 - An overlay inode that loses its last reference while it is dirty is
   kept until it has been written and then sits on the LRU, like with
   any other file system. Clean and unlinked ones are still freed right
   away.
 - Every overlay on such an upper file system gets a bdi.
 - I haven't measured syncfs() with a very large number of dirty inodes.

For testing I put several overlays on one upper file system and dirty
192M next to the overlay under test, through another overlay and
directly. Then syncfs() or unmount the one overlay, copy the block
device as it is at that moment, mount the copy, and check that
everything that was changed through the overlay is in it and that the
192M aren't. That passes with ext4, xfs and btrfs as the upper file
system. With KASAN and lockdep on, syncfs() goes from 239-284ms to
45-48ms and unmount from 126-234ms to 39-44ms. With ext2 and ext4
without a journal the 192M are written as before.

fstests with -overlay, the auto groups of generic and overlay, gives the
same results with and without the series on ext4 and on xfs.
