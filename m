Hi David, Hi Joel,

I reworked the context side of the series so that priv is gone entirely;
and the final tree has no per-entry context pointer.
A small helper recovers the enclosing object, but it needs the slot
index from the caller:

   #define sysctl_table_container(entry, type, member, index) ({       \
           static_assert(__same_type(*(entry),                         \
                                     typeof_member(type, member[0])),  \
                         "pointer type mismatch");                     \
           (type *)((void *)(entry) - offsetof(type, member) -         \
                    (size_t)(index) * sizeof(*(entry)));               \
   })

The reason plain container_of() is not enough is that the core keeps the
table as a contiguous array.  For

   struct addrconf_sysctl_table {
           struct addrconf_sysctl_ctx context;
           struct ctl_table table[];
   };

the handler receives an interior entry, and

   container_of(ctl, struct addrconf_sysctl_table, table)
       == (char *)outer + index * sizeof(struct ctl_table)

for ctl == &outer->table[index].  It only returns the outer object for
index 0.  Passing the index explicitly keeps the original registered
entry usable:

   static int addrconf_sysctl_forward(const struct ctl_table *ctl, ...)
   {
           struct addrconf_sysctl_table *t =
                   sysctl_table_container(ctl, struct addrconf_sysctl_table,
                                          table, 
ADDRCONF_SYSCTL_FORWARDING);
           const struct addrconf_sysctl_ctx *ctx = &t->context;
           ...
   }

Shared handlers get one wrapper per slot; the common body does not need
to know its position:

   #define DEVINET_CONF_WRAPPER(attr)                                  \
   static int devinet_conf_##attr(const struct ctl_table *ctl, ...)    \
   {                                                                   \
           struct devinet_sysctl_table *t =                            \
                   sysctl_table_container(ctl,                         \
                           struct devinet_sysctl_table, devinet_vars,  \
                           IPV4_DEVCONF_##attr - 1);                   \
           return devinet_conf_proc_common(ctl, &t->context, ...);     \
   }

Single-entry tables simply use slot 0:

   struct devinet_forward_table *t =
           sysctl_table_container(ctl, struct devinet_forward_table, 
table, 0);


The series is 20 commits over 134 files, with no priv at any point.  If
you would prefer a different shape for the helper or the wrappers, I am
happy to adjust it.


Thanks,
Wen
