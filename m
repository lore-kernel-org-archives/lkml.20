OK, let's work with the assumption that it is really needed.  Though I
would still explore the option of lazy/debounced disabling of clocks
and other resources controlled by the remote host.

I was thinking something like   mboxes =3D <&cpm_tx_mba>
clk_mailbox simply asks for some channel, gets allocated the next free
slot. The mailbox controller driver keeps track of the channel-slot
map locally and is responsible for managing contiguous slots and
completing the tx upon receiving ack.

It is not the diff stat but about inserting a flag in the api to
introduce special case behavior. It is like adding one person to the
party introduces N-1 handshakes - the has_queue flag doesn't play well
with other configurations and may allow future platforms to abuse
has_queue to implement hacks.
