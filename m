Ah there's already a precedent, e.g. specifying __GFP_RECLAIM means you get
a KMALLOC_RECLAIM cache, but it may or may not be accounted depending on
passing also __GFP_ACCOUNT and there are no separate sets of slabs for
these. Also same can happen with kmem_cache_create() cache when only some
allocations are __GFP_ACCOUNT.

Both mean that objcg pointers might exist for the slabs from the cache, but
SLAB_ACCOUNT also implies __GFP_ACCOUNT for every allocation from the cache
even if not given. But for kmem_bucket_alloc() with SLAB_BUCKETS=n with we
have nowhere to store that this implication should be done (that would be
the "compatibility layer").

Yes that's why we must avoid it. SLAB_MAY_ACCOUNT is a new thing and because
there were already many caches that may or may not pass __GFP_ACCOUNT, we
just assume it for now in __kmem_cache_create_args(). But that's a TODO to
start tightening it. With buckets we only have a handful of users so we
could try doing that right away, and have warnings in place to catch any
changes that push it into the "wrong" state.

We could warn and fallback then, I guess.

"SLAB_ACCOUNT requires __GFP_ACCOUNT" means that if it's not done and
SLAB_BUCKETS=n, then we get the issue that patch 2 fixes, and have no way to
actually find out and warn that it's the case (with SLAB_BUCKETS=n... the
warning can be issued with SLAB_BUCKETS=y and then it passes through as if
there was __GFP_ACCOUNT).

Also instead of the scheme above, maybe we could explore the idea of
"compatibility layer" too. It would mean that even with SLAB_BUCKETS=n,
kmem_buckets_create() would create some object to hold the gfp_flags we want
to append to all allocations from that bucket. But then kmem_buckets_alloc()
would have to do something a bit more than map to __kmalloc_node_noprof
(with PASS_KMALLOC_PARAMS directly). Of course SLAB_BUCKETS=y would be using
this way too then to avoid further complication. Maybe the result would be
more cleaner (simplifying PASS_KMALLOC_PARAMS and getting rid of
PASS_BUCKET_PARAMS?) but I can't say immediately how well it would work.
