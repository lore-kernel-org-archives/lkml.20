I put this first patch on pci/aspm for v7.4 because there seems to be
a consensus that it's better to have the ASPM core disable things even
if it doesn't technically have control of ASPM, because the
alternative is that drivers just do it themselves, also ignoring ASPM
ownership concerns.  Having the drivers do it just means the PCI core
ASPM support doesn't know what's happening.

I think we should defer the rest of these because I think there's a
little room to make the enable/disable/force-enable dance more
intuitive for the drivers.  As far as I know, the rest of the series
is definite cleanups but doesn't fix any actual functional issues.
