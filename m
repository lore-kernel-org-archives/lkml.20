Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Add support for retrieving files that were preserved from a tmpfs mount
by restoring them into a file that userspace created on a tmpfs mount.
Add struct liveupdate_shmem_retrieve_arg, which userspace passes as the
retrieve argument of LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_RETRIEVE_FD with a file
descriptor for that file, and record which files were on a tmpfs mount
with a new SHMEM_LUO_FLAG_TMPFS flag in struct shmem_luo_ser. The next
commit allows preserving tmpfs files.

The mount a tmpfs file was on doesn't exist in the new kernel, and the
path, owner, mode, extended attributes and other metadata of the file
are not preserved. Userspace knows what they should be, so let it create
the file, e.g. with O_TMPFILE, and only restore the contents and size of
the preserved file into it. Userspace can then link the file at the path
it wants. LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_RETRIEVE_FD returns the file descriptor of
the file instead of a new one.

This also fixes a bug: shmem_luo_can_preserve() is meant to only accept
memfds, but it only checks that the file has no links, so it accepts
unlinked tmpfs files by mistake. They are then retrieved as memfds,
which moves them off their mount and out from under the size limit and
quotas of the mount. Retrieving such a file without an argument now
fails with -EINVAL if it was preserved by a kernel with this commit. The
new flag uses an existing field that is zero otherwise, so a kernel
without this commit ignores it, and still retrieves tmpfs files as
memfds.

The target must be an empty regular file on a tmpfs mount, opened for
writing. Like the preserved file, it must be on a tmpfs mount, so that
memfds stay memfds and tmpfs files stay tmpfs files. Files on tmpfs
mounts always have exactly F_SEAL_SEAL, so there are no seals to
restore. The file position isn't restored either, since the open file
belongs to userspace.

A preserved file with unknown flags or seals, or a tmpfs file with
seals other than F_SEAL_SEAL, can't be restored, so fail its retrieve
permanently.

Fill the target like a write does: with write access to the superblock
and the inode lock held, calling file_modified() before and
fsnotify_modify() after. Add the folios while i_size is still 0, and set
i_size last. Reads, page faults and memfd_pin_folios() don't look past
i_size, so nothing sees the folios until the file is complete, and if
adding them fails, they can be removed again to leave the target empty.

Claim the target with liveupdate_claim_file() before modifying it, so
that a file that LUO already manages is rejected, e.g. a file that is
preserved in an outgoing session and whose size is frozen.

Like the other failures before the folios are restored, problems with
the argument and the target can be retried.
