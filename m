The CM3 of the MIPS I6500 multiprocessing system serializes the requests
of all cores, IOCUs and the hardware prefetcher before they reach the
shared L2 and the memory interface. It provides two programmable 32-bit
event counters and a 32-bit cycle counter to observe this traffic:
coherence manager requests, I/O and memory interface requests, AXI bus
utilization and PDTrace statistics. Each event is refined by a 64-bit
qualifier split into groups of bits (port, thread, command, CCA, L1/L2
state, ...), where a request is counted when it matches a set bit in
every group.

Expose the counters as uncore PMUs bound to the coherency-manager DT
node, using the GCR block already mapped by mips_cm_probe(). Events are
described by 'event' (config:0-8, 0x100 selecting the cycle counter)
and 'qual' (config1:0-63); a qualifier of 0 picks a per-event default
that counts every occurrence. Named events are provided for the common
combinations and double as templates for custom qualifiers.

Every cluster has its own CM3 and its own counters, so one PMU named
mips_cm3_pmu_<cluster> is registered per cluster found in GCR_CONFIG.
A cluster does not need CPUs, online or at all, for its L2 and memory
interface to be busy, so the counters of other clusters are accessed
through the GCR redirect block from whichever CPU runs the PMU. This
only requires the CM of that cluster to be powered, which is checked
in the CPC (CM core STAT_CONF) when an event is opened: the counters
of a powered down cluster are initialized lazily on first use and
events on it fail with -ENODEV meanwhile. The counters are shared by
the whole cluster: events are system-wide only, pinned to a single CPU
which follows CPU hotplug; sampling, task events and the exclude_*
attributes are rejected.

Counter overflow is handled through the CM interrupt when the DT node
provides one, and by periodic polling otherwise, giving 64-bit counts
in both cases. Each cluster's CM drives its own interrupt output into
its own GIC, and a GIC shared interrupt is only routed to the cluster
of its affinity CPU, so the interrupt serves the cluster the CPUs live
in, and only when they all live in that one cluster; everything else
is polled.

Document the perf interface, the event numbers and the qualifier layouts
in Documentation/admin-guide/perf/mips_cm3_pmu.rst.

+=================================================================
+MIPS Coherence Manager 3 (CM3) Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU)
+=================================================================
+
+The Coherence Manager 3 (CM3) of the MIPS I6500 multiprocessing system is
+the point where the requests of all cores, I/O coherence units (IOCU) and
+the hardware prefetcher are serialized before reaching the shared L2 cache
+and the memory interface. The CM3 implements a small set of performance
+counters which observe this traffic:
+
+- two programmable 32-bit event counters, and
+- one 32-bit cycle counter clocked at the CM3 clock.
+
+The counters live in the global debug block of the CM Global Configuration
+Registers (``GCR_DB_PC_*``), are shared by all CPUs of the cluster, and count
+regardless of which CPU, privilege level or task generated the traffic. They
+are exposed by the ``mips_cm3_pmu`` driver (``CONFIG_MIPS_CM3_PMU``, built-in
+or as the ``mips_cm3_pmu`` module) as uncore PMUs.
+
+Clusters
+========
+
+A multi-cluster system has one CM3, and so one set of counters, per
+cluster. The number of clusters is read from ``GCR_CONFIG`` and the driver
+registers one PMU per cluster, named after the cluster number::
+
+  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/mips_cm3_pmu_0/
+  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/mips_cm3_pmu_1/
+
+A single-cluster system only has ``mips_cm3_pmu_0``. Each PMU counts the
+traffic of its own cluster: a request from a core in cluster 1 to the memory
+interface of cluster 1 is seen by ``mips_cm3_pmu_1`` only.
+
+A cluster does not need CPUs for its CM to be busy: its L2 cache and memory
+interface may serve I/O devices behind its IOCUs while its cores are absent,
+offline or powered down. The counters of any cluster are therefore reached
+through the GCR redirect block from whichever CPU runs the PMU, which can be
+in any cluster. What is needed is that the CM of the counted cluster is
+powered: the driver checks the CM power sequencer state in the Cluster Power
+Controller (``CPC_STAT_CONF`` of the CM "core") when an event is opened and
+fails with ``-ENODEV`` if the cluster is powered down. The PMU of the
+cluster the CPUs run in is always usable.
+
+Because the counters are shared, events are system wide only. Sampling
+(``perf record``), attaching to a task, and the ``exclude_*`` attributes are
+not supported; ``perf stat -a`` is the intended interface. The ``cpumask``
+attribute names the single CPU on which the counters are programmed and
+read; it migrates to another online CPU when that one goes offline::
+
+  $ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/mips_cm3_pmu_1/cpumask
+  0
+
+Counter overflow
+================
+
+The CM3 raises its ``so_cm_perf_cnt_int`` output when a counter reaches
+0xFFFFFFFF. Whether that output reaches an interrupt controller input is a
+decision of the SoC integrator. If the ``coherency-manager`` device tree node
+carries an ``interrupts`` property, the driver uses it to extend the counters
+to 64 bits. Otherwise the driver polls the counters every 250 ms, which is
+well below the time the fastest event needs to wrap a 32-bit counter. Either
+way, the values reported by perf are 64-bit.
+
+The interrupt can only serve the cluster the CPUs live in, and only when
+they all live in that one cluster. Every cluster's CM drives its own
+interrupt output into its own GIC, and a GIC shared interrupt is routed to
+the cluster of its affinity CPU, so a single ``interrupts`` entry cannot
+serve several clusters at once. The PMUs of all other clusters, and all PMUs
+when CPUs are spread over several clusters, are polled.
+
+The mode chosen is printed at probe time, or the fact that the cluster was
+powered down when the driver probed; the counters are then initialized when
+the first event is opened::
+
+  mips_cm3_pmu coherency-manager: mips_cm3_pmu_0: 2 counters + cycles, polled
+  mips_cm3_pmu coherency-manager: mips_cm3_pmu_1: cluster powered down
+
+Event encoding
+==============
+
+An event is described by two fields, documented in the ``format`` directory::
+
+  $ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/mips_cm3_pmu_0/format/event
+  config:0-8
+  $ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/mips_cm3_pmu_0/format/qual
+  config1:0-63
+
+``event`` selects the event number written to ``GCR_DB_PC_EVENT``. The
+value ``0x100`` is a pseudo event selecting the cycle counter.
+
+``qual`` is the 64-bit qualifier written to ``GCR_DB_PC_QUALn``. It refines
+the event: the qualifier is split into groups of bits, each group covering
+one attribute of a request (originating port, command, cacheability, L2
+state, ...). A request is counted when, in **every** group, the bit
+matching its attribute is set. Setting several bits of a group ORs the
+alternatives; setting all bits of a group makes it a "don't care". A ``qual``
+of 0 (or omitting it) selects a per-event default that counts every
+occurrence of the event.

+
+The named events are plain ``event=...,qual=...`` strings, so they serve as

+narrow down.
+
+Examples
+========
+
+Count all CM requests and the share coming from port 1 (core 1), together
+with cycles, for one second::
+
+  $ perf stat -a -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/cycles/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/cm_requests/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/event=0x1,qual=0xfffffffffffffc02/ \
+                 sleep 1
+
+The second qualifier is the ``cm_requests`` default with the Port group
+(bits 9:0) reduced to bit 1.
+
+L2 hit rate of memory requests::
+
+  $ perf stat -a -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/cm_requests_l2_hit/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/cm_requests_l2_miss/ sleep 1
+
+Utilization of the memory read data channel: cycles with a transfer versus
+cycles where the CM waits for data (valid deasserted)::
+
+  $ perf stat -a -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/cycles/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/mem_axi_r/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/event=0x7,qual=0x3d/ sleep 1
+
+Requests received by IOCU 1 (IOCU number is an encoded value in bits 2:0)::
+
+  $ perf stat -a -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/event=0x2,qual=0x3fffffffff9/ sleep 1
+
+Memory interface traffic of every cluster of a two-cluster system::
+
+  $ perf stat -a -e mips_cm3_pmu_0/mem_requests/ \
+                 -e mips_cm3_pmu_1/mem_requests/ sleep 1
+
+Only two programmable counters exist; a group requesting more than two
+non-cycle events, or more than one ``cycles`` event, is rejected with
+``-EINVAL``.
+
+Device tree
+===========
+
+The driver binds to the ``coherency-manager`` node (``mti,mips-cm`` or
+``mobileye,eyeq6-cm``) and uses the GCR base address already discovered by
+the kernel from the ``CMGCRBase`` register. An ``interrupts`` property on
+that node, when the SoC routes ``so_cm_perf_cnt_int`` to an interrupt
+controller, enables interrupt-driven overflow handling::
+
+  coherency-manager {
+      compatible = "mobileye,eyeq6-cm";
+      interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
+      interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 42 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+  };

+ * MIPS Coherence Manager 3 (CM3) performance counter PMU driver
+ *
+ * The CM3 found in the MIPS I6500 multiprocessing system implements two
+ * programmable 32-bit event counters and a 32-bit cycle counter. They are
+ * controlled through the GCR global debug block (GCR_DB_PC_*) and count
+ * events happening at the coherence manager: serialized requests, I/O and
+ * memory traffic, AXI bus utilization, ...
+ *
+ * perf interface:
+ *
+ *   config  [8:0]  event number (GCR_DB_PC_EVENT.Px_Event), 0x100 selects
+ *                  the cycle counter.
+ *   config1 [63:0] event qualifier (GCR_DB_PC_QUALn). A qualifier is split
+ *                  into groups of bits, each selecting one attribute of the
+ *                  request; an event is counted when it matches at least one
+ *                  set bit of every group. Setting all bits of a group makes
+ *                  it a "don't care". A qualifier of 0 selects a sensible
+ *                  default which counts every occurrence of the event.
+ *
+ * Every cluster has its own CM3 and therefore its own set of counters, and
+ * one PMU instance (mips_cm3_pmu_<cluster>) is registered per cluster. A
+ * cluster does not need CPUs, online or at all, for its L2 and memory
+ * interface to be busy, so the counters of other clusters are reached
+ * through the GCR redirect block from whichever CPU runs the PMU. This
+ * requires the CM of that cluster to be powered, which is checked in the
+ * CPC before an event is opened.
+ *
+ * The counters are shared by the whole cluster, so events are system wide,
+ * pinned to a single CPU, and cannot be sampled.
