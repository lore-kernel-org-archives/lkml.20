I'd split out an IIO series but take your time as no particular rush
given these won't merge until next time around.

Excellent!

yeah.  We do seem to cut and paste bad practice and bugs around :(

Good point on naming.

Ah indeed. Should be scoped_guard() but can wait for someone else
who cares enough to do that and maybe not worth it anyway.  I got
lost in imagining what the other refactors would look like.
