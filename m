Thanks for doing it. Other than a few nits, it looks good and it's also quite
impressive it didn't trigger a single sashiko issue!

It also breaks neither kunit nor libgpiod tests.

I'm a bit hesitant to queue it immediately before v7.3 so I'll let you address
Andy's reviews in a v2 and pick it up during the merge window.
