You are right — v1 as posted does re-introduce that problem. The perf
handler returning NMI_DONE unconditionally means every latent/spurious
NMI falls through to the reason port path (raw_spin_trylock on
nmi_reason_lock + inb 0x61), which is exactly what df4d29732fda was
designed to avoid.

v2 takes a different approach: consult the latency window in
default_do_nmi() before the reason port read, not after. When the
window is open, the expensive I/O and the global lock are skipped —
identical to the upstream behaviour. The difference is that the
dispatch path does NOT take the "handled" short-circuit exit; instead
it continues into unknown_nmi_error(), which gives NMI_UNKNOWN
handlers (hpwdt, etc.) a chance to identify the NMI.

The cost breakdown per spurious NMI within the window:

upstream (v0): perf claims → goto out
cost: ~10ns (time_after check only)

v1 (broken): perf NMI_DONE → trylock + inb(0x61) → ... → suppress
cost: ~600-1500ns (I/O + lock contention)

v2: perf NMI_DONE → window check → skip reason port
→ nmi_handle(NMI_UNKNOWN) → suppress
cost: ~60-110ns (list traversal, no I/O, no lock)

The only additional work compared to upstream is traversing the
NMI_UNKNOWN handler list. On a typical system that is 1-2 handlers
doing a quick per-CPU variable check each. No I/O port access, no
global lock, no cross-CPU cache line bouncing.

The SERR#/IOCHK# trade-off is unchanged from upstream: when the window
is open, the reason port is not read. This was already the case with
the original mitigation (perf claiming the NMI skips everything after
it). v2 does not make this worse.

v2 will follow as a separate posting. Key changes from v1:
·Add perf_nmi_window_active() check in default_do_nmi() between
the NMI_LOCAL return and the reason port block. The entire reason
port section (trylock, get_nmi_reason, SERR/IOCHK dispatch,
reassert_nmi, unlock) is wrapped in if (!perf_nmi_window_active()).

·Guard perf_nmi_window_active() with "if (!perf_nmi_window) return
false" so that on non-AMD platforms (where amd_core_pmu_init()
never runs and perf_nmi_window stays 0) the strong symbol cannot
accidentally suppress NMIs due to a zero-initialized
perf_nmi_tstamp.

·Initialize per-CPU perf_nmi_tstamp to (jiffies - 1) in
amd_core_pmu_init() so the window starts definitively closed.
Without this, on 32-bit kernels where INITIAL_JIFFIES places
jiffies near the 32-bit wrap point, time_after(jiffies, 0)
evaluates to false for the first 5 minutes of uptime, falsely
indicating an open window.


Thanks
