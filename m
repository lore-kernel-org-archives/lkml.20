The commit message is rewritten to open with why a pluggable model
is wanted and describe the current behavior.  It also clarifies that
the model prices every charged IO rather than every IO.

Done: declared in block/blk.h without the export, and blk-iocost-bpf.c
includes "blk.h" instead of carrying local prototypes.

The bdev and q cases in .init_member() are gone, and the redundant
name lookup is removed from .init().

ops->q and the owning link are written with WRITE_ONCE() and read
with READ_ONCE().

Done: the ejection reads bdev into a local before clearing ops->q.

Done: ioc_bpf_eject() with a stub drops the #ifdef from
ioc_rqos_exit(), and the attached and model pointers in struct ioc are
unconditional, so the remaining #ifdefs in ioc_cost_model_write() are
gone too.

You were right that blkcg_mutex alone did not serialize against blkg
creation from the IO path.  The attachment is now published and
cleared under blkcg_mutex and queue_lock, and the blkg walk is
performed under the same locking; the init walk goes parents first
like blkcg_activate_policy().

Done: .unreg records the owning link in the ops and only detaches
when the closing link matches.

Done: the attach holds rq_qos_mutex from the disk_live() check
through the unfreeze, like ioc_cost_model_write() does, so the unlock
window, the queue reference, the second q_to_ioc() and its comment
are gone.
