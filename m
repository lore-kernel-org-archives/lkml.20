This was carried over from the old test, where /dev/zero was the default
backing for mmap unless the user selected another file to back the
mapping. Now since we don't support file backed mappings, we can
directly use MAP_ANONYMOUS here. Thanks for pointing it out, I'll remove
it from this patch.

Yup, seems like keeping 128 pages is not adding an extra value. I'll go
with 2 hugetlb pages to test both pinning within a hugetlb page and
across the hugetlb boundary. This would make things a lot simpler.
