In the past, sharing Sashiko review results was tedious.  Also it was
suggested to minimize the recipients on the sharing mails.  Hence the AI
review section of DAMON maintainer profile document was updated to give
guidance about available tools for making the sharing easier, and how
the recipients list should be managed.

Now DAMON is onboarded [1] to Sashiko's automatic review replies
feature.  Sashiko directly sends its reviews as replies to the patch
mail thread. It also reduces the recipients list to deliver the
reporting to only the author and the mailing list.

Remove the old guidance that is no more necessary but only confusing.
