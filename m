Memory from devm_kzalloc() is freed when the driver is unbound, but a
device node that user space holds open outlives the unbind. Driver
state that an open file can reach, such as an embedded struct cdev,
video_device or miscdevice, must therefore not be managed memory; when
it is, the next file operation, typically close(), is a use-after-free.
The pattern is long-standing and is still fixed driver by driver. In
mainline today cx231xx allocates its state, with four video_devices
and its mutex embedded, with devm_kzalloc() against the USB interface,
defers its release to close() when a node is open, and devres frees the
state at unbind regardless; xilinx_hwicap embeds its struct cdev in
devm memory the same way.

Add a runtime debug check rather than a static rule: from
device_unbind_cleanup(), with device_lock held, before
devres_release_all(), snapshot the device's managed allocations, walk
every thread's open files once, and warn when a file's private_data,
its inode's i_private, its inode's cdev for a character device, or an
object a subsystem names through a small hook still points into an
allocation about to be freed. Such a pointer dangles once the memory
is freed; it is a use-after-free if anything dereferences it
afterwards, which for private_data is any operation, for a cdev its
release on close, and for a debugfs file a new open or an unguarded
release. One WARN backtrace is printed per allocation; further holders
of it get one line each.

The cdev route works because an open non-O_PATH chrdev file holds a
reference on its cdev's kobject from chrdev_open(), and inode->i_cdev
is cleared only when that kobject is released, so the pointer is
stable here even after cdev_del(); it is compared, never dereferenced.
It only helps when the struct cdev itself is in managed memory: V4L2's
cdev is a separate cdev_alloc() with no kobject parent and misc's is
one shared cdev, so neither leads to the driver's allocation, which is
what the hook is for. The next patch adds V4L2's.

debugfs files need care, because many drivers remove theirs through a
devres action that runs inside devres_release_all(). A hit on a debugfs
file that remove() already took down is decided at once; a hit on a
live one is recorded as (pid, fd, file address) and looked up again
after release. If debugfs has revoked the file by then
(debugfs_file_revoked()) and its release callback is one that cannot
touch the data (debugfs_file_release_safe()), it is reported at info
level; if the release is the driver's own it is a WARN naming it, and
so is a file still live or removed with unguarded file_operations.

The check runs only from the unbind and failed-probe paths, not on
probe deferral and never from devres_release_all() itself, which is
also reached from device_release() and so from any context in which a
final put_device() is legal. The walks run on a kernel thread the
unbinding task waits for: a file reference the walk holds becomes the
last one if the owner closes the file meanwhile, and dropped from a
user task its release would be queued to that task's task work, after
unbind, where a devres action waiting for the close (snd_card_free())
would deadlock under device_lock; dropped from a kernel thread it goes
to the delayed-fput work instead. What remains: that work drains one
global list last-in-first-out with all its runs serialized, so a
release there that needs a lock unbind holds (a usbfs close takes the
USB parent lock a USB interface unbind holds) stalls every later
delayed close, including one such an action is waiting for; without
this option that close would have run from its owner's task work. No
file reference is kept across release. Fd tables are walked once each,
de-duplicated by (owning task, table pointer) with a reference on the
task only; no reference is ever taken on another task's fd table, since
dropping the last one would run that task's file releases in the walk.

Limitations, also stated in the Kconfig help: only files in task fd
tables are seen; the check finds pointers that are dangling at that
moment, not teardown races, nor whether a debugfs removal action ran
before or after the free; a managed allocation whose release waits for
its files to close first (an ALSA card) is not about to be freed, so a
hit on it is a false positive; and the walk is linear in threads times
fd tables and costs every unbind and failed probe.

Written with Claude (Anthropic) under my direction; see the cover letter
for the disclosure required by Documentation/process/generated-content.rst.

+Managed memory is freed on driver unbind regardless of whether anything
+else still refers to it.  In particular a device node that user space
+holds open outlives the unbind, so driver state that an open file can
+reach - a struct cdev, video_device or miscdevice embedded in it - must
+not live in devm_kzalloc()'d memory.  Allocate such state with kzalloc()
+and free it from the release callback of the object that user space
+holds, or from a refcount dropped on last close.  debugfs private data
+may be managed memory only if the file is created through
+debugfs_create_file() or one of debugfs's typed helpers such as
+debugfs_create_u32() or debugfs_create_blob(), not through
+debugfs_create_file_unsafe() with the driver's own file_operations, so
+that debugfs refuses operations on it once removed, and the file is
+removed before the allocation is freed: in the remove callback, or by a
+devres action registered after that allocation.
+CONFIG_DEBUG_DEVRES_REFS reports, at driver unbind or after a failed
+probe, open files that still point into a managed allocation about to
+be freed; its Kconfig help text lists what it can and cannot see.

+=09  Before a driver's managed (devm) allocations are freed, on unbind
+=09  or after a failed probe, walk the open files of every thread and
+=09  WARN if one still points into an allocation about to be freed:
+=09  through file->private_data, the inode's i_private, the inode's
+=09  cdev for a character device, or an object a subsystem names
+=09  through a hook (V4L2 names the video_device). Such a pointer
+=09  dangles once the memory is freed; it is a use-after-free if

+=09  operation that uses it, for a cdev a new open of the device node
+=09  and its release on close, for a hook object whatever the

+=09  release. One WARN backtrace (which
+=09  taints the kernel) is printed per allocation per unbind; further
+=09  holders of the same allocation get one line each.
+
+=09  A removed debugfs file on which debugfs refuses further operations
+=09  (one created through its full proxy, or through one of its own
+=09  guarded helpers such as debugfs_create_ulong() or
+=09  debugfs_create_blob()) is reported at info level if its release
+=09  callback is one that cannot touch the data, and warned about
+=09  naming the callback otherwise. A debugfs file still live during
+=09  the walk is decided after the managed resources were released,
+=09  since drivers often remove their debugfs files through a devres
+=09  action: removed and safe to close by then is info, anything else
+=09  is a WARN. A file created with a debugfs _unsafe variant and the
+=09  driver's own file_operations gets no guard; it is deferred like a
+=09  live debugfs file and then warned about.
+
+=09  The walks run on a kernel thread, so a file reference the walk
+=09  turns out to hold last is released from the delayed-fput work and
+=09  never from the unbinding task, so a devres action that waits for
+=09  a file to close does not wait on the walk. What remains: that
+=09  work drains one global list last-in-first-out with all its runs
+=09  serialized, so a release there that needs a lock unbind holds (a
+=09  usbfs close takes the USB parent lock a USB interface unbind
+=09  holds) stalls every later delayed close, including one such an
+=09  action is waiting for; without this option that close would have
+=09  run from its owner's task work. No file reference is kept across
+=09  the release of the managed resources.
+
+=09  Limitations: only files in task fd tables are seen, so references
+=09  held by sockets, epoll, io_uring or kernel-internal files are not;
+=09  the check runs from the unbind and failed-probe paths only, not on
+=09  probe deferral nor on other devres release paths; a V4L2 driver's
+=09  state reached only through the video_device's drvdata is not
+=09  named, since that needs dereferencing the video_device; it finds
+=09  pointers
+=09  that are dangling at that moment, not teardown races, nor whether
+=09  a debugfs removal action ran before or after the free; a managed
+=09  allocation whose release waits for its files to close first (an
+=09  ALSA card) is not about to be freed, so a hit on it is a false
+=09  positive; a driver that keeps freeing devm memory after remove()
+=09  returned can make it misreport. The walk is linear in threads
+=09  times distinct fd tables and costs every unbind and failed probe.
+
+=09  This is a slow debug check intended for test systems.
+
+=09  If you are unsure about this, say N here.
