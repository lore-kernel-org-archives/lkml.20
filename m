This was intentional - I forget where the exact discussion happened, but 
at the time we decided that exposing reserved regions for entire windows 
was the wrong thing to do, as being pessimistically inaccurate might be 
OK for the internal DMA API, but restricting userspace is another 
matter, and I think the consensus was that it wasn't really the IOMMU 
layer's job to get deep into PCI details anyway. Such "accidental" P2P 
can only happen within a group that's assigned to VFIO as a whole, so 
IIRC the conclusion was that users should already have enough 
information at the VFIO level to avoid BAR addresses if they need to.

In fact we did briefly do this once before, and it was explicitly undone 
again by cd2c9fcf5c66 ("iommu/dma: Move PCI window region reservation 
back into dma specific path."). I think there may also have been a 
practical issue with it breaking some standard Qemu setups.

Thanks,
Robin.
