You have it mostly right. The devsec sample has no real measurements. Its
refresh only puts the new nonce into a fake request, so the "measurements
changed" lines just reflect the nonce. I'm dropping the
attestation_evidence_replaced() idea.

There are two issues for TDX Connect. One, the device info is collected at
SPDM connect (TDH.SPDM.CONNECT), not at lock. TDH.TDI.BIND only returns the
interface report. So the measurements a TD sees at lock can be from well
before the lock. To get measurements taken after the bind, the TD has to
ask the VMM for a recollection with its own nonce.

Second, a device may take a runtime firmware update of equal or higher SVN
while its TDIs stay locked, unless the lock sets NO_FW_UPDATE. The TD isn't
told when that happens. The VMM picks the lock flags, and INTERFACE_INFO
bit 0 in the interface report tells the TD whether updates are permitted
while locked. Currently our host passes no lock flags and nothing in the
guest checks that bit.

With NO_FW_UPDATE set and the evidence collected after the bind, tying the
generation to the lock works for me.

On the RMM sequence counters, I don't think TDX has an equivalent set. What it
has is a bind session ID. The TD reads it after the bind, and TDG.TDI.START
only succeeds with that same ID. Before START the TD checks the device info and
report against the TDX Module's digests. After START it relies on the state the
TDX Module tracks, which can lag as I mentioned.

A list works for me. It covers 0 and 32 for a device, 64 for TDX, and other
sizes later.

SPDM puts the requester's nonce in the GET_MEASUREMENTS request, and only when
the request asks for a signature. The MEASUREMENTS response always carries the
responder's own nonce, and the signature covers the request too. An unsigned
request has no nonce and gets an unsigned response.

The empty challenge in my provider means something else though: don't
recollect, return the evidence collected earlier. So it's less "omit the
nonce" and more "no new collection". Maybe that's better as an explicit flag
than an empty challenge?

The TDX family is the TD's own attestation (TD report, Quote and RTMRs), with
no device or SPDM in it. In wip_attestation_all_1 it inherits ctlv-attestation
directly, so I think the test's 4 is what's stale. Jiri would know for sure.
