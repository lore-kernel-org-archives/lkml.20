The minItems one is not valid. sashiko struggles on our quirks against 
normal json-schema. Generally, if either minItems or maxItems is not 
specified, we make them equal. I think I documented that, so we need to 
get sashiko to read it...

I have a branch of ~600 questionable patches. :) It does make arm64 
warning free (and some of the warning fixes are valid).

What's left is really stuff that's old, not getting new platforms and no 
one cares about. I don't think we need perfection. We should probably 
just ignore sashiko.

I've tried expressing my preferences in priority, but it hasn't worked. 
It was mainly GSoC or other programs, but now it's?

My priority is:

- Fix arm64 warnings
- Fix arm warnings
- Convert subsystem bindings
- Fix other $arch warnings (no one cares AFAICT)

We're actually pretty close to arm64 being warning free. krzk's LPC 
slides inflate the numbers as N boards for a SoC give N copies of 
warnings. next is currently sitting at 218 warnings in my deduped count. 
About half of those are HiSilicon and Mediatek. The rest of the 
platforms (by subdir) are around ~20 or less.

arm32 is still a long way off. The recent platform removals should help 
though.
