40 minutes elapsed from when I asked for changes to when a fully formed
new driver was posted with major changes. Your cover letter says this
v2 was tested on real hardware, however I am honestly a bit skeptical
given the short time frame. On top of that, that's not enough time to
also go through what all Claude did for you. Please slow down!!

I'm going to pass on reviewing this version. I want you to take some
time to test this on real hardware, and understand the code. If after
that you truly have no additional changes, then I'll reconsider
reviewing this version.

Also, if you want to help, then consider helping with reviews on patches
from other people, in particular with the large series for the new SoC
vendors. It's a lot of work reviewing the flood of patches from
everyone. You can see the backlog for the clk core on the kernel.org
patchwork server.
