There were some changes proposed for KVM previously around this:
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250923050317.205482-14-Neeraj.Upadhyay@amd.com/

The idea was to have KVM track the injected level-triggered interrupt in 
its copy of APIC_ISR so that it can issue EOI to the I/O APIC properly.

However, this would require some guest changes at least. Either:
- issuing a VMGEXIT on each EOI (regardless of APIC_TMR in the guest 
  backing page), or
- tracking level-triggered vectors in the guest and issuing a VMGEXIT on 
  EOI only for those.

The former is problematic since guests can queue IPIs themselves, so it 
isn't always possible to ensure EOI exits correspond to a previously 
injected I/O APIC interrupt. For the latter, guest will need to do more 
work to track and issue EOI accurately. Doable, I think, but it isn't 
clear to me that this is worthwhile, especially for modern SEV-SNP 
guests with Secure AVIC support.

Sure.
