Please re-write this in your own words.

It's rambling on and never gets to the point of _what this patch does and
why_.

I'm not interested in reading a novel to understand the code :)

It seems very LLM generated, LLMs are _terrible_ at writing commit messages
and commits, please re-write all of that.

Why are this and the other patches in-reply-to 1/4? That's not how you send
a series in mm.

This is a really weird mix of kdoc style + not kdoc style while not being a
kdoc, for a static function?

We don't need a prose version of the code, and it reads like AI slop, we
don't want AI slop comments, thanks.

Why is rmap_item function-scoped when it could be block-scoped here...

This code is very ugly.

I don't love just shoving more logic into an already massive function. No
to this.

At some point technical debt has to be paid, clean up this code first please.

Similarly schloppy.

All in all adding far too much complexity in a cycle which is
fix-focused...
