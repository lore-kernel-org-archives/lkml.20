Hello,

I missed this thread before sending my previous reply.

That would be great!

Cool. It'd be nice to see that happen.

I think precise is for IP and it's not clear if it applies to other REGS
too.  But agree that it'd be simpler to reject.

That's true.  perf tools can fallback to auto-reduce the precise level
unless it's requested manually.  If we go on this direction, I think we
should mention this in the man page though.  Probably the condition is
precise_ip + USER_REGS + USER_STACK.
