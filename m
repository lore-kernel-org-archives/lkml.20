yeah. This is what I meant. I was trying to show my literal 
understanding on "The proposal is to have TDX simply match VMX 
behavior". i.e., I don't think "have TDX simply match VMX behavior" is a 
good name/summary for what Binbin has proposed.

So the proposal is making TDX behave as if the relevant VMCS save/load 
controls (if any) are set around TDH.VP.ENTER.

In fact, what matters for host vmm is just the VM_EXIT_LOAD_XXX control. 
So the proposal becomes "If there is VM_EXIT_LOAD_XXX control for a 
state, TDX needs to restore the host state after TDH.VP.ENTER. If no 
such contorl, TDX sets the state to INIT state after TDH.VP.ENTER".

It's a fancy idea. And it provides a clear rule of how TDX handles 
states of a feature so that host VMM developers don't need to read the 
TDX module API to figure out what's the value of a state after TDH.VP.ENTER.

It's helpful for host VMM developers, though I'm not sure on TDX module 
developers.
