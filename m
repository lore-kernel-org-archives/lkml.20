Right, that's a non-mainline kernel I guess? Which presumably implements private memory.

Jack himself experienced a panic with his pKVM code, so the code you're using is
not upstreamable, unfortunately. And he'd already shelved pKVM support AFAICT.

And reviewers pointed out actually implementing the pKVM stuff properly would be
quite involved, even if you wanted to do that (hence follow-up).

Also you end up stuck with the same problems as I mentioned above - you can't
sanely bring the vCPU pre-run, so now you have extremely weird behaviour - only
pre-faults if vCPU initialised, running, and unprotected pKVM.

Protected pKVM support is a whole other layer of complexity and it's not obvious
that you're really achieving what pre-fault is supposed to.

In any case Oliver literally just asked me to _simplify_ weird edge cases for
this series :) so I am not sure something like that is going to be accepted.

Are you sure you're actually running in pKVM mode btw? CCA doesn't AFAICT? In
which case this series _should_ work fine for you.

Anyway, if we really do need to add something for pKVM it needs to be a follow
up. Let's get the basics working first :)

(Note that kvmtool will need to be updated to retry pre-fault on -EAGAIN, -EINTR
 as this series can, albeit unlikely, return -EAGAIN.)
