There's also the subtlety that __cleanup shouldn't be used in functions
that are already using goto-based cleanup.

And any kernel code preparing a key also has the raw key too and has to
zeroize that too, otherwise doing so for the prepared key is pointless.

... unless it's not actually a secret key, which sometimes it isn't.
We've been getting a lot of zeroization patches that try to add
zeroization for public keys, which is nonsense.  And also for pointers
to keys, which people confuse with the keys themselves.

There are also Rust bindings being proposed, and they handle zeroization
by calling memzero_explicit() directly.  So that's yet another case
where these new functions are not applicable.

I'm increasingly thinking that we shouldn't try to explain all the
zeroization stuff in the kerneldoc, and instead add a documentation file
in Documentation/crypto/ that properly explains the conventions for
crypto key zeroization in the kernel and defer to that.

The struct-specific zeroization functions are still worthwhile, but I
think they should be seen as trivial wrappers around memzero_explicit().
So maybe just add all of them with minimal comments like I suggested
above (maybe even just add them for all the algorithms in a single
patch), and add a file Documentation/crypto/zeroization.rst separately.
