From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

perf already uses debuginfod to fetch source files when annotating
(via probe-finder.c) and 'perf probe' has open_from_debuginfod(),
which queries debuginfo keyed by build ID when a module's debuginfo
isn't found locally, largely the same thing this adds; eventually
that one could be moved over to the new helper.  For the analysis
tools there was no way to obtain the debuginfo for a DSO in a
profile when it isn't available locally under the name the DSO was
opened with, for instance the vmlinux for the kernel a profile was
recorded on when processing it on another machine, or after the
kernel and its debuginfo package got upgraded in between.

Add debuginfo__find_build_id(), that uses the debuginfod client to
locate a debuginfo file keyed by the build ID, checking its local
cache first and then querying the servers in DEBUGINFOD_URLS, and
debuginfo__new_build_id(), that opens the DWARF in the file it finds.

The debuginfod client fails when DEBUGINFOD_URLS isn't set even when
what it wants is in its local cache, and the distro setup scripts that
populate it from /etc/debuginfod don't reach cron jobs, systemd services
and other environments that don't source the profile scripts, so also
set it from the .urls files in /etc/debuginfod when not set.  That has
to happen before any thread that can call getenv() is started, as
setenv() is not thread safe, and there are getenv()s outside the fetch
lock: libdebuginfod reads DEBUGINFOD_URLS in every debuginfod_begin(),
which perf also does in build-id.c, probe-event.c and probe-finder.c,
so do it from symbol__init(), on the single-threaded setup, and not
lazily from the fetch path.

Querying servers, possibly third party ones, sends off-box the build
IDs of the binaries being analysed and a fetch can take a while, so
this is opt-out: on by default, off with --no-debuginfod, with
core.debuginfod=false, per tool with report.debuginfod and
top.debuginfod, and, since users that set buildid.dir to /dev/null
(e.g. Linus) or otherwise turn the local build-id cache off clearly
don't want fetched files stored on the box, off too in that case.

The opt-outs also cover libdwfl's own debuginfod client, that reads
DEBUGINFOD_URLS in every query: when debuginfod is off, be it with
--no-debuginfod, core.debuginfod=false or by disabling the build-id
cache, the variable is set to the empty string, that the client treats
as an opt-out and fails the query without even looking at its cache,
instead of being exported from /etc/debuginfod.  Tools that manage
DEBUGINFOD_URLS themselves, such as 'perf record --debuginfod', keep
doing so.

The fetches are serialized, as the lookup state they use is process
global, so two concurrent fetches would race for it, and serializing
also means that a request for a build ID that is being fetched doesn't
start a second download of the same file: it waits for the fetch to
finish and is answered from the entry the fetch published, keyed by the
build ID, with the path of the file that came back, checked before
being handed out in case the debuginfod client cache is cleaned from
under us.

Make dso__debuginfo() use debuginfo__new_build_id() as a fallback,
keyed by the build ID recorded in the perf.data file, so that
consumers such as the data type profiler can resolve the types of
DSOs whose debuginfo can be fetched this way.  Do the fetch outside
dso__lock, a fetch from a remote debuginfod server can take a while
and would otherwise block anything else using this dso, and remember
the build IDs that were a miss, so that consumers revisiting a set of
DSOs repeatedly, such as the data type profiler on every hist entry
DSO switch, don't pay server round trips per attempt.

debuginfo__new_build_id() needs libdw to open the DWARF, so it lives
in debuginfo.o, built only with CONFIG_LIBDW, while the libdebuginfod
feature check is independent of NO_LIBDW; keep the new build ID
prototypes under HAVE_LIBDW_SUPPORT too, with stubs otherwise, so
that make NO_LIBDW=1 on a system that has the debuginfod client
keeps linking.
