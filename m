Makes sense too. In this case, if both buffers share the same cache
line, I *guess* that would just be a redundant flush.

With "clean write back" are you referring to a write back without
invalidating the line?

Very interesting talk, DMA is way messier than I thought. I guess it's
the price of supporting so many different architectures.

I recently got my hands on an FPGA board so I'm gonna be playing with
it, although it seems DMA is still way out of my reach :p.

Thanks for your review! I already finished v4 and I should be able to
submit it tonight.
