Hi,

This is a patch series covering the support for protected mode execution in
Mali Panthor CSF kernel driver.

It builds on the initial RFC posted by Florent Tomasin back in January of 2025.

The initial RFC can be found here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1738228114.git.florent.tomasin@arm.com/

The Mali CSF GPUs come with the support for protected mode execution at the
HW level. This feature requires two main changes in the kernel driver:

1) Configure the GPU with a protected buffer. The system must provide a DMA
   heap from which the driver can get protected buffers.
   It can be a carved-out memory or dynamically allocated protected memory region.
   Some system includes a trusted FW which is in charge of the protected memory.
   This problem is integration specific and the responsibility to allocate the
   required protected memory from the correct and system specific DMA heap is
   left to user space (Mesa). Panthor CSF driver must be handed the needed
   buffers via new IOCTLs.

2) Handle enter and exit of the GPU HW from normal to protected mode of execution.
   FW sends a request for protected mode entry to the kernel driver.
   The acknowledgment of that request is a scheduling decision. Effectively,
   protected mode execution should not overrule normal mode of execution.
   A fair distribution of execution time will guaranty the overall performance
   of the device, including the UI (usually executing in normal mode),
   will not regress when a protected mode job is submitted by an application.


Background
----------

Current Mali Panthor CSF driver does not allow a user space application to
execute protected jobs on the GPU. This use case is quite common on end-user-device.
A user may want to watch a video or render content that is under a "Digital Right
Management" protection, or launch an application with user private data.

1) User-space:

   In order for an application to execute protected jobs on a Mali CSF GPU the
   user space application must submit jobs to the GPU within a "protected regions"
   (range of commands to execute in protected mode).

   Find here an example of a command buffer that contains protected commands:

```
          <--- Normal mode ---><--- Protected mode ---><--- Normal mode --->
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ... | CMD_0 | ... | CMD_N | PROT_REGION | CMD_N+1 | ... | CMD_N+M | ... |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

   The PROT_REGION command acts as a barrier to notify the HW of upcoming
   protected jobs. It also defines the number of commands to execute in protected
   mode.

   The Mesa definition of the opcode can be found here:

     https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/main/src/panfrost/lib/genxml/v10.xml?ref_type=heads#L763

2) Kernel-space:

   When loading the FW image, the Kernel driver must also load the data section
   of CSF FW that comes from the protected memory, in order to allow FW to
   execute in protected mode.

   The FW uses the same protected memory buffer to execute protected jobs from
   all processes on the system. Note: This buffer must be provided by a user
   space process with CAP_SYS_MODULE though.

   In addition, when a CSG (group) is created, it must have a protected suspend
   buffer. User space must provide this buffer on group creation if it want to
   execute protected jobs.

   The required size of both these buffer types can be queried. See
   query type DRM_PANTHOR_DEV_QUERY_PROTM_INFO.

Design decisions
----------------

The earlier versions (RFC and v1) relied on in-kernel allocation of protected
DMA-bufs, both for the required FW memory (system wide), and per group
suspend buffers (per process). This is no longer needed.
Starting with v2, this is now changed and it is user space which is responsible
for supplying these buffers.
Only a user space processes with elevated privileges (CAP_SYS_MODULE) is trusted
to provide the system wide protected FW memory. This only needs to happen once
per boot, and is needed before any non-privileged processes can make use of
protected rendering.

The Mali Panthor CSF kernel driver will handle enter/exit of protected
mode with a fair consideration of the job scheduling.

If the system integrator does not provide a protected DMA heap, the driver
will not allow any protected mode execution.

Testing
-------

1) Platform and development environment

   Any platform containing a Mali CSF type of GPU and a protected memory allocator
   that is based on DMA Heap can be used. For example, it can be a physical platform
   or a simulator such as Arm Total Compute FVPs platforms. Reference to the latter:

     https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms/Total%20Compute%20FVPs

2) Mesa:

Previous versions
-----------------
v3: https://lkml.org/lkml/2026/9/11/1187
v2: https://lkml.org/lkml/2026/7/12/369
v1: https://lkml.org/lkml/2026/5/5/1523


Highlevel changes
-----------------

Changes in v4:
- Main changes are to the "drm/panthor: Add support for entering and exiting protected mode" patch.
  A new approach to avoid uneccesary protm premption by non-running VMs.
  This patch do need some splitting before final version. Will do that if
  this approach gets the general approval.
- Split the old patch "drm/panthor: Expose protected rendering features" into
  multiple smaller patches.
- See each patch for detailed changes

Changes in v3:
- Dropped patch "drm/panthor: Explicit expansion of locked VM region"
- See each patch for detailed changes

Changes in v2:
- Conceptually similar to v1, but heavily reworked to address fault handling
- User space provides all protected memory buffers (no in-kernel dmabuf alloc)

Boris Brezillon (7):
  drm/panthor: Pass drm_file instead of panthor_file
  drm/panthor: New function for FW section map flags
  drm/panthor: Keep size and VA in FW section obj
  drm/panthor: Refactor GEM usage flags assignment
  drm/panthor: Create kernel BO from existing GEM
  drm/panthor: Support FW init of protm
  drm/panthor: Protm support for groups

Florent Tomasin (2):
  drm/panthor: Minor scheduler refactoring
  drm/panthor: Add support for entering and exiting protected mode

Ketil Johnsen (3):
  drm/panthor: De-duplicate FW memory section sync
  drm/panthor: Don't allocate protm_suspend_buf
  drm/panthor: Bump version to expose protm feature
