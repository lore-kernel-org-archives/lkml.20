No compacting will save you in some cases. There are setups with many GPUs=
=20
and with VF BARs, the space requirement to fit full-sized ReBARs is way=20
beyond what the root bus resource can hold. Where's your fallback for such=
=20
cases? What are the failure modes of that fallback?

Not just that, using too large size has ripple effects on other resources=
=20
in the system, and those failures are hard to correct (your code doesn't=20
even try to do that).

Assuming you meant we apply this kind of naive approach first and later=20
changing to the new algorithm, the problem with that approach is this
"hack" must not break working setups either, but it surely would. If it=20
does break things, the change will just end up reverted. And that end=20
result is same as not doing the "hack" at all.

It's not enough it doesn't break your setup. It generally must not break=20
any setup, which is unfortunately very very high bar.
