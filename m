Sure, I didn't mean to suggest you couldn't have arrived at it independentl=

offered the tag because I'd proposed it in the earlier discussion and you a=

with it there.

It's used / abused within subsystems to hardwire stuff, which should indeed=
 be
fixed, but also doesn't justify the taint, as it is not userspace controlli=
ng
it.

Oh, there's a new usage in new_device_store() as of v7.3-rc1. I wasn't awar=
e of
this. I'd just make it call the device_set_driver_override_store() function
then, as it is exactly the same class of issue.

I would have preferred "\n" too, but I don't want to mess with this uAPI. W=
hen I
implemented the driver_override generalization I looked it up (e.g. in [1])=
 and
tools seem to care about this. driverctl handles both cases, as it is bus
agnostic, but I don't know what else exists.
