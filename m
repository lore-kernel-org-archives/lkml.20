For ordinary filesystems where close-time work is not itself part of a
stronger synchronization contract, I think the answer should be fairly
clear: close() should not expose EINTR to userspace after consuming the
fd.

close() does not provide a durability guarantee. It *may* report
deferred I/O errors or errors discovered during close-time work, but
an application which requires synchronization has an explicit
interface such as fsync() or fdatasync() for that purpose.

So if such close-time work happens to be interrupted, I don't see what
useful recovery semantics exposing EINTR provides. The fd is already
gone and close() cannot safely be retried. Returning success seems more
useful than exposing an interruption which the caller cannot act on.

NFS and devices make the question more interesting, though. Some
implementations put meaningful state transitions into their close path.
Tape devices are an obvious historical example: depending on the
device/mode, close may write filemarks, flush tape buffers, rewind, etc.
Those operations are not necessarily replaceable by fsync() before
close().

But I think EINTR is problematic there too, for almost the opposite
reason. If the semantics require some close-time operation to complete,
then returning EINTR after the fd has already been removed leaves
userspace with no generic way to complete that operation:

  close(fd) -> EINTR

    - fd is already closed on Linux
    - retrying close(fd) is unsafe
    - the interrupted operation cannot be resumed through fd

That seems to leave a few possible designs:

1. The close-time operation is required. Then the kernel should complete
   it despite non-fatal signals, or provide some explicit operation which
   userspace can use to request/check completion.

2. The close-time operation is best-effort. Then interruption should not
   turn an already completed descriptor release into EINTR; returning
   success seems more appropriate.

3. POSIX.1-2024 also provides EINPROGRESS for the case where the fd has
   been closed but close-time work is incomplete. That at least describes
   the state correctly, although I still don't see what useful recovery
   operation userspace has if the work can only be performed through the
   now-consumed fd. In addition, the implementation in musl suggests
   that this wouldn't be compatible with real-world programs.

What seems particularly difficult to justify is the current Linux result:

  close(fd) -> EINTR

while the fd has nevertheless been irrevocably consumed. It has the
usual appearance of a retryable interruption without providing any safe
way to retry it.

So replacing -EINTR with 0 still looks attractive to me as the generic
close() behavior, even if removing all long synchronous close operations
would be a larger project.

It may also make sense independently to diagnose ->flush()
implementations which return an interruption result in cases where that
means required close-time work has been abandoned. I would be interested
in whether there is a good way to warn or trace those cases without
complaining about the fatal-signal case Matthew mentioned.
