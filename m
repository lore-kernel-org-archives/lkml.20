I meant only these two lines:
    to_max310x_port(port)->one_char_duration_us =
	DIV_ROUND_UP(USEC_PER_SEC * frame_bits, baud);

Its unfortunate that you trimmed some parts of the original email so we
no longer see the relevant code...

But maybe you should reword/improve your comments then?

So at 115200, this could mean 128 reads each ~90-100 us?

Could using the interrupt to detect tx empty could improve
efficiency and reduce load on I2C/SPI bus?

I am not saying your approach is wrong, but it just made me think of
potential issues and things to consider.
