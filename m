include/uapi already has its own header checking infrastructure under
CONFIG_UAPI_HEADER_TEST and usr/include/Makefile, which avoids this with
a no-header-test list that includes many of the files listed in these
messages. To be honest, we should probably forbid HEADER_CHECK from
including 'include/uapi' and refer people to use CONFIG_UAPI_HEADER_TEST
instead, as there are other differences like being built under a
different C standard or C++ and such that the existing infrastructure
handles.

That said, I think the overall idea seems fine and relatively clean, at
least from my Kbuild perspective, as it is completely opt in, so the
previous objection to CONFIG_HEADER_CHECK_DISABLE and widely exposing
this to builds is pretty much moot.
