Hi Roman,

My assumption was that v1 would still be maintained for some time
before its eventual removal, and the goal was to reduce the coupling
between the remaining v1 code and the shared core structures during
that period, rather than to rewrite the implementation for its own
sake.

If the expectation is that the remaining v1 implementation will be
removed in the near future, then I agree this work becomes much harder
to justify.

Am I being too optimistic about how long the remaining v1 code is
expected to stay around?

Thanks,
Tao
