I just wanted to chuck my thoughts in here, as some of this is my fault
and it would be really helpful to discuss it on the list. As you probably
know, on Android, pKVM has the semantics you describe above: the ONE_REG
calls succeed, but the register state isn't propagated to the guest once
it's started running. I think we largely did it this way because we were
solving a million problems at once during the initial development and
having to pipe-clean VMMs wasn't particularly appealing at the time.
It's also worth adding that, to my knowledge, we've never had any issues
in Android because of this decision.

So, based on that, it really sounds like it's the best option. If it ain't
broke, don't fix it!

*However*, I can't think of another upstream interface that behaves like
that and, when we came to document it, it was quite difficult to explain
it in a way that could be extended in the future. If we say that ONE_REG
doesn't propagate to the vCPU after first run and returns whatever was
last written, then userspace could (even accidentally) rely on that. If
we wanted to extend it, I think we'd not only need a method to advertise
the new behaviour (which I think you probably want even if ONE_REG
returned an error before) but also an opt-in for userspace to say that
it's ok with the new behaviour. In some ways, it feels a bit like the
"unchecked flags" problem for syscall arguments.

Right, this wasn't the rationale.

I think you can use that argument both ways: if the VMM knows it cannot
obtain the registers, then it's fine to return an error if the VMM does
something wrong.

In our recent investigation, it turned out that both kvmtool and crosvm
were perfectly happy with ONE_REG returning an error in normal operation
but we needed a handful of fixes for kvmtool [1] to handle things like
the 'debug' command.

If it's helpful, we can ask the crosvm developers here if they have
opinions for/against the two behaviours?

I think we'll have to do that either way, no? The VMM needs a way to
know that ONE_REG works and the situations in which it works. If the old
behaviour wasn't to return an error, it's also going to need a way to
enable the new behaviour.

The nice thing about that is that we can presumably tie it in with LD64B
support for protected VMs.
