Thanks for running it again. Everything from the RFC mail is already
folded into the tree.

That's fixed.

That's fixed. I'm keeping the proc_{read,write}_buf() variants.
All methods are documented in porting.rst now.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Dropped because Hao Ge sent the same fix in August that I hadn't seen.

Good catch. We can simply move removal to the front and md_new_event()
takes the entry pointer under RCU that then gets cleared/synchronized
before the removal. So no side can reach a freed entry or the destroyed
workqueue. Looks like input and sunrpc have the same problem.

Hm, I think that's fixable like sysfs does by allowing to specify a key
per entry.

Dropped.

Yeah, dropped it when I folded the patch in, I guess.

Fixed.

Added to the changelog.

JOSEF! I already got yelled because of the amount of patches. :)
