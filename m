It seems to generally work better in pci=3Drealloc case but there are still=
=20
some disabled Expansion ROMs that do lose their upstream bridge windows=20
(win gets disabled) and some cases with mixed pref & non-pref VF BARs=20
where the latter do not appear.

norealloc case looks messy but I account that to changes made in my series=
=20
as it alters auto switch to pci=3Drealloc to happen less frequently, which=
=20
can of course cause more assignment failures but it also tries to retain=20
the original setup from FW better.

I don't know at this point if the problem is in my series or yours, I will=
=20
have to look deeper but that won't be until next week.
