greybus is very light-weight, you don't need to have more than one
message in flight.  That's not a real answer :)

That's for LSTP, and USB devices are dirt cheap, multi-endpoint ones
should also be very cheap compared to the system they are attempting to
control here.  Don't place this on a "it would cost too much so we are
going to fix that by making the software a complex beast and having
someone else solve our problem for us" solution driven by a hardware
designer.  That's not acceptable these days, you all know that...

What state needs to be managed here for Greybus?  And given that there
is firware and kernel code for greybus already written and working for
10+ years, that feels simpler to me.

You don't have to do the high-bandwidth devices, just be a low-bandwidth
device.  and "size" of an operation doesn't make sense here, it's just
bytes in a buffer that you have plenty of on both sides of the
connection.

There are new proposals for the spec, see the mailing list.  And what is
missing for your needs that isn't currently present?

I haven't read all of OBMF, as obviously that isn't what is being
proposed here, I was just complaining about the madness of attempting to
create a device tree representation for a single USB device that wanted
to be carved up into different virtual devices because no one decided to
learn from history.

I have other objections about OBMF-ICP, but that's not what this thread
is about, sorry.  Please propose your own patch series for that and I'll
be glad to criticize it there.

And all of these seem to be OMBC answers, not LSTP answers.  There's
still no excuse for LSTP to be designed like this :)

It's always fun to make a new spec and protocol, but getting an ID
doesn't mean that usb-if says "this is how it shoudl be done."  Anyone
can get an ID :)

sorry,
