Quite frankly, I don't care what you are choosing to implement in the
driver or what your first-party boards support. The binding must
represent the capabilities of the device, not what subset you deem
relevant at this point in time. I'm not going to ack anything that does
not consider all use cases for the device, especially since I the more I
look the more I am convinced that this is the wrong way to model the
relationship between devices and therefore intentionally ignoring a use case
is likely to be problematic when someone does decide that they want to use
that feature.

Of course, that's what I was talking about when I said:
| In that case, I can't really see how it makes sense for the primary iio
| device to change when data is fed back through the mdf or taken
| directly from the ADC itself, particularly given how that would affect
| the userspace interface.

To me, in that ADC to MDF use case, the frontend portion of the aggregate
device presented to userspace needs to be the ADC and the MDF needs to be
the backend, since otherwise the ADC will simultaneously be frontend and
backend, depending on which channel is considered. That makes no sense to me
when the MDF can always be the backend, for all use cases and avoid that
sort of problem entirely.
I've heard no argument as to why the MDF cannot be a backend, just that you
don't want to because the previous device didn't, but copying what was
done before isn't a justification that bears weight if how it was done
before isn't the way it should be done.

Thanks,
Conor.
