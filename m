Hi Hitalo,

> Since commit a13f316e90fd ("Bluetooth: hci_conn: Consolidate code for

> deletes the hci_conn, after a Create Connection Cancel that cannot
> cancel a synchronous connection. When a new socket connects right away,
> e.g. PipeWire recreating the HFP transport after a codec negotiation as
> in bluez/bluez#2562, the abandoned setup can still complete, and:
>
>  1. It is matched to the new connection by address, the controller then
>     rejects the new connection's own setup, and the rejection handler
>     fails the first link on the ACL, which is now the connected one,
>     without disconnecting it (patch 1).
>
>  2. It is matched to the new connection before that connection's own
>     setup was sent: Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection goes through
>     the cmd_sync queue, and any setup waits for the ACL to leave sniff
>     mode. The setup is then sent anyway and rejected. This is the order
>     of events in the report (patch 2).
>
>  3. Nothing takes it over, or it is a second link for a connection
>     that is already up: the link stays up in the controller with no
>     connection for it, and the controller rejects every further setup
>     for the device until the ACL drops (patch 4).
>
> Patches 3 and 5 make links that complete for an aborted connection be
> disconnected in general, as Luiz suggested, not only SCO ones. Patch 3:
> a link (ACL, SCO/eSCO or LE) that completes while its connection is
> being aborted, which then refuses the handle since 16e3b6429159
> ("Bluetooth: hci_conn: Fix modifying handle while aborting") and, for
> LE, 181a42edddf5 ("Bluetooth: Make handle of hci_conn be unique").
> Patch 5: an incoming ACL connection aborted after it was accepted,
> which is deleted before its link completes. Patch 6 stops notifying
> the driver of the air mode of a SCO link that did not come up: with
> btusb, that notification and the one for the connection's deletion
> right after could stop the audio of another SCO connection. btusb can
> still do that when a SCO link that was up goes down while another one
> stays up; that is not changed here.
>
> In 1 and 2 the new connection keeps the link of the abandoned setup,
> with the parameters of that setup: the completion event does not say
> which setup it belongs to. Its Air_Mode would show a change between
> CVSD and transparent data, but the series does not act on it. An
> abandoned setup that fails after a new connection was made, in Command
> Status or in its completion event, is likewise applied to that
> connection. Before a13f316e90fd both happened in another way, as the
> next socket reused the pending hci_conn.
>
> If a controller answers the setup of a SCO_LINK connection (only SCO
> packet types allowed, e.g. with the disable_esco parameter of sco.c)
> with an eSCO link, that link was ignored, so the connect timed out and
> the link stayed up. Patch 4 now lets the connection take it, as an
> eSCO connection already takes a SCO link.
>
> Changes in v3:
> - Patch 4: a SCO_LINK connection takes an eSCO link that answers its
>   setup, instead of the link being ignored and left up (Sashiko). T6
>   now checks that the connection gets the link.
> - Patch 1: the commit message notes that a Command Status does not
>   tell which setup failed, which the patch does not change (Sashiko).
> - Rebased on bluetooth-next 97a128698d9d, without conflicts.
> - Tests for BlueZ's sco-tester and l2cap-tester that abort a connection

> Changes in v2:
> - New patch 3, following Luiz's review: disconnect any link that
>   completes while its connection is being aborted, on Connection
>   Complete, Synchronous Connection Complete and LE Connection Complete.
>   It replaces the SCO-only handling of that case in v1's patch 3, and
>   covers the ACL and LE cases Sashiko pointed out.
> - Patch 4 (v1's patch 3) uses the helper of patch 3, and also
>   disconnects a second SCO link that completes with Connection Complete
>   for a connection that is already up (Sashiko).
> - New patch 5: disconnect an ACL link that completes after its
>   connection was aborted and deleted (an incoming connection).
> - New patch 6: notify the driver of the air mode only of a SCO link
>   that came up (Sashiko).
> - The disable_esco case is described as what it is: a controller
>   answering a SCO-only setup with an eSCO link.
> - New tests T5b, T7, T8 and T9.
