You seem to have missed my point. Pretty much all system/uncore PMU 
drivers - other than the trivial ones with non-programmable free-running 
counters and no interrupt - have to pick a CPU to associate with, 
irrespective of whether it's from the whole system or some specific 
subset, and they all do so effectively arbitrarily, whether that's by 
cpumask_local_spread(), cpumask_any(), cpumask_any_and() or whatever. If 
one driver picking an arbitrary CPU is a problem that needs fixing, why 
do the dozens of other drivers which also pick an arbitrary CPU not also 
need fixing?

And the answer is that they do! Irrespective of whether systems might 
want particular CPUs to do particular things, we've already seen that in 
systems with lots of PMU instances, when they all end up on the same 
default "any CPU", it ends up severely over-serialising event scheduling 
to a degree that can start to significantly impact event runtimes.

> Do you have an alternate API in mind?

I don't see this being practical without first generalising the notion 
of CPU affinity so that it can at least be dealt with from a single 
place in the perf core. Inconsistent, ad-hoc hacks in individual drivers 
will not scale or be maintainable. Perf core also then has a reasonable 
chance of being able to reliably avoid racing against itself, whereas 
attempting to mitigate racy calls from within those calls when it's 
already too late is never really going to be a proper solution.

Thanks,
Robin.
