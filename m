Subject: [PATCH v4 10/18] perf trace: Drop targets that died before they were filtered
From: Ian Rogers <irogers@google.com>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

sched_process_exit() takes a task out of pids_to_trace and pids_filtered
as it dies, which keeps the maps holding live tasks rather than growing
for the length of the session. It only finds a task there if userspace
put it there first, and userspace writes a pid some time after reading
it:

 - trace__set_filter_pids() writes the thread map and the --filter-pids
   list before the programs are attached, so for those there is nothing
   watching them die at all.
 - trace__set_startup_pids() writes what it enumerated after the attach,
   which is a much smaller gap but still a gap.

A task that dies inside one of those windows is never evicted, because
the delete that would have done it ran while the map had nothing to
delete. Its pid then sits in the map for the rest of the session: it
holds one of a fixed number of entries, and pids are reused, so the
unrelated task that eventually receives it is treated as the target, or
as a task the user asked to leave out and is then silently not reported.

Walk both maps once the last write to them is done and remove the tasks
that are not alive. Sweeping the maps rather than the lists that were
written to them covers every way a pid can get in, including the pid of
perf itself and of the terminal it was started from, which
trace__set_filter_loop_pids() adds without recording anywhere. A task
found alive here and dying later is one sched_process_exit() can see and
evict, so a single pass is enough, and the tasks the BPF programs add
for themselves need nothing: sched_process_fork() inserts a task before
it has run, so it cannot have died beforehand.

Deleting the key the walk is standing on leaves bpf_map__get_next_key()
to resume from a key that is no longer there, which
htab_map_get_next_key() answers with the first key of the whole map,
starting the walk over. The walk therefore only ever stands on a key it
has found alive, which is one it has just decided to keep, so nothing it
deletes is ever the key it would go on to ask from. A key deleted while
the walk stands on nothing is not a problem either: the next request is
for the first key of the map, and the deleted one is no longer it.

sched_process_exit() deletes keys while this runs and can take out the
key the walk is standing on, which there is no way to prevent or to
notice. The walk is bounded at max_entries steps so that it ends however
often that happens: the map holds no more than that many keys, so a walk
that has taken as many steps has either seen them all or been restarted,
and the bound is what stops a walk that keeps being restarted from going
round for ever. Ending on the bound can leave a dead task behind, which
costs one entry of a great many until the session ends, where not ending
would cost the session itself.

A task is taken to be gone when its /proc entry is not there, and also
when /proc reports it as Z or X. Both mean it is in or past do_exit(),
which is where sched_process_exit() runs, so waiting for a zombie to be
reaped before dropping it would only keep a dead task in the map for
longer.

Everything else, including not being able to tell, leaves the task in
the map. The two mistakes are not equal: a dead task left there holds an
entry nothing needs, while a live one taken out stops being traced for
the rest of the session, so a read that fails for perf's own reasons,
being out of file descriptors or of memory, is not read as the task
having exited.

Reading that state means finding the end of the command name, which
do_task_stat() writes out unescaped, unlike /proc/<pid>/status: it holds
whatever the task called itself, ')' and newlines included. The whole of
/proc/<pid>/stat is read rather than a line of it, because a line stops
at the first embedded newline, short of the name's closing ')', and the
last ')' in the file is taken as that one, since no field after the name
has parentheses in it.
