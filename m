Serge, your comment reminded me of hwrng. In my opinion TPM driver
should limit itself randomness supply because it could have positive
effect on some issues that people are having [1]. hwrng can never
properly control TPM as it is behind abstraction.

I think there should be a tpm_chip associated pool of randomness. This
pool is filled with some timer triggering with a constant frequency. On
each iteration, it is filled with best effort i.e. with a single
TPM2_GetRandom invocation.

Then hwrng_fill is also filled with best effort from the pool without
any TPM interaction.

This would be an architecture that would be vastly easier to deduce
than the one which we have now, which is more unstable, which is
bad considering e.g., latency peaks and whatnot.

This basic idea can be improved with a low watermark: when going 
below it hwrng_fillfn would start the timer. I don't think high
watermark is needed as pool can be always filled just up to its
size.

I had this idea already 3-4 years ago but had forgotten about it.
