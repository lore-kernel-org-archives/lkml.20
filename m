OK, so then it would help if it was broken down how these different
components and their interaction work in simple terms.

OK so tpm_ftpm_tee is/was a bad name but also renaming modules causes
issues.

It should have probably been "tpm_optee_ftpm".

So I would do instead this:

- tpm_optee -core
- tpm_optee_dtpm -your driver
- tpm_ftpm_tee

I.e. let's accept a glitch but don't repeat the faulty naming pattern.
