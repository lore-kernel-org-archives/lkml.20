Hi Oliver, thanks for reviewing!

Sure, one of the reasons I sent like this is so Tian could use it as a base 
for his next version.

So you mean that DBM being treated as "writable" could _only_ happen if we 
have VTCR_EL2.HD=1? I was previously under the impression that it could be 
used regardless of HD value.

Okay, I think I can see it now: since the guest hypervisor could use RO/RW, 
and has no decoupled concept of dirty and writable, it could think all 
writable pages are dirty when we run above function.

So.. would it make sense to have an out->dirty, which we would check based 
on S2AP while out->writable is compared against DBM, and we change the 
logic that uses out->writable to properly match it, maybe based on the 
guest having the feature enabled?

Thanks for your patience on explaining this!
