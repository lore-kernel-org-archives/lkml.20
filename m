Hi Christopher,

I agree with Günther and I'd like to bring, from my point of view, the
most important thing about TTY master FDs: they are mean to send
arbitrary data/signals to TTY slaves, and in most cases this mean inject
keys and then commands.  So TTY master FDs should be seen as a
(legitimate) way to control another process, even if that might not
always be the case.

A case in point would be an SSH or sudo/su command attached to a slave
TTY.  The process able to write on the related master TTY FD should be
considered as privileged as the slave command.  This illustrates why
human-computer interfaces (including TTYs, desktop interfaces...) are so
critical.

Also, just adding these LSM hook changes would break exisiting LSM's
security policies.

Updating the Landlock doc with this rationale is defenitely a good idea.

Testing this invariant is also valiable, so it would be nice to tweak a
bit your test and include it with the doc update.

Regards,
 Mickaël
