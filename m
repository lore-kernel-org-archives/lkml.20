Subject: [PATCH bpf-next v3 08/12] bpf: Recover the low 32 bits on the reverse link direction

A low-32 link over a wide base drives sync_linked_regs() forwards only.
Narrowing the base reaches the members, but narrowing a member tells the
base nothing:

	r6 = ...		/* full 64-bit unknown */
	w7 = w6;
	w7 += 5;
	if w7 != 15 goto ...	/* so (u32)r6 == 10 */
	if w6 == 10 goto ...	/* not deduced */

That refusal is broader than it needs to be, in two ways.

It only applies to a *wide* base in the first place -- the guard is
scoped on get_reg_width(reg) > 32. A base that fits 32 bits is equal to
the member's low half, so a compare on the member pins it exactly, and
such a pair already falls through to the differencing arm. What the two
mov patches had to get right there is which extension rebuilds it, since
choosing wrong is unsound rather than merely imprecise.

And for a wide base it is only the *high* half that is unrecoverable.
Writing the two registers against the same abstract X, the member is
ext(X + d_member) and the base is X + d_base, so their low 32 bits are
(X + d) mod 2^32 and differ by the known constant d_member - d_base. The
member therefore pins the base's low half exactly; what it says nothing
about is everything above bit 31.

Eduard put it as a direction rather than a kind, on v2 03/13:

> - if known_reg is sext/zext -> sync to 'full' register recovers only
>   lower 32-bits and keeps upper untouched (counting on cross-domain
>   bounds sync logic).

So instead of skipping, add the delta difference to the member's 32-bit
range and intersect it into the base's r32 and tnum_subreg, leaving r64
and the upper tnum to reg_bounds_sync(). Never writing the high half
directly is what keeps this sound. Dropping the guard outright instead
makes scalars_alu32_basic and zext_narrow_dst_keeps_base verify, and both
must not; they still fail here.

It buys nothing today, and is proposed anyway. No verdict changes on any
of the three corpora, and on its own it costs nothing anywhere. The zero
is a result rather than a non-event: instrumenting the new arm to emit a
token, it fires 78 times under bpf-gcc and 40 under clang, so programs do
reach it and come out identical. zext_reverse_pins_low_half is a
__failure without the patch.

It does interact with the narrowing-fill patch that follows -- together
they cost big_alloc2 2956 -> 3095 insns where neither does alone -- which
that patch spells out, since a bisect lands the cost there.

v3: new in v3.
 - answers Eduard's point on v2 03/13: the reverse direction recovers
   the low half even though it cannot recover the high one. A base
   that fits 32 bits was never refused -- the guard is scoped on
   get_reg_width(reg) > 32 -- so this is the remaining case, a base
   wider than 32 bits.
 - proposed for merge, not tagged, and it buys nothing today -- no
   verdict changes on any of the three corpora.
 - costs nothing on its own. With the narrowing-fill patch that follows
   it costs big_alloc2 2956 -> 3095 insns; neither produces that alone,
   and a bisect lands it on the fill patch, which says so.
 - the arm is instrumented to confirm it is reached rather than merely
   silent: 78 firings under bpf-gcc, 40 under clang.
