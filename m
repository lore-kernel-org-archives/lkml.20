The M62's analogue input gains, output volumes and output source
selectors are reached over a vendor protocol on the card's HID
interface, which hid-topping, added in the previous patch, speaks.
This adds the controls themselves, on the sound card that plays the
audio, and the component master that joins them to that driver.

Seventeen controls in Pro Audio Mode: five input gains (IN 1, IN 2,
AUX, BT, OTG IN), two output volumes (HP, OTG OUT), the two output
source selectors, and a source selector and a gain for each of the four
loopback returns. The outputs come in pairs and the device announces
only the second of each, so both are written and the second is the one
listened for. A selector answers on one target of a pair -- the second
of an output's, the first of a loopback return's -- and a loopback
return's gain is written to both, as Q25 in whole decibels from -89
to +12 dB, the values the vendor application writes for each step. The
mixer matrix, the mutes, the input power and the EQ remain reachable
only through the HID driver's hidraw node.

The M62 has three operating modes, chosen on its own panel, and keeps
one USB ID in all three; the high byte of bcdDevice tells them apart:
01xx Mobile, 02xx Live Streaming, 03xx Pro Audio. Live Streaming goes
with Pro Audio: the application's connect push in each writes the
inputs, the loopback returns and the outputs at the same targets and on
the same scales, and Live Streaming only adds two mixes and an effects
bus that no control here reaches. In Mobile Mode the card is a two-in,
two-out device for a phone. It mixes all of its inputs into one stereo
recording, which is the whole of its capture: a microphone on IN 1, a
phone on Bluetooth and a source on AUX are all in it at once. The
host's playback is not in the recording; the headphones carry it with
every input. The card has no output selectors and no loopback returns
in that mode, and the vendor application shows none and writes none.

Part of the address map means something else in Mobile Mode. The
application writes whole decibels there to property 03 of 0x51..0x54,
where Pro Audio Mode takes Q25, and 0x51/0x52 is the level of the
recording itself: on a card in Mobile Mode, writing to it the 0 dB in
Q25 that Loopback 1/2 Capture Volume starts at raised the recording
by 9 dB, from -87.7 to -78.5 dBFS of input noise. The selectors have
nothing to select. So a row that belongs to Mobile Mode alone, or to
the other two alone, says which, and the mode is taken from bcdDevice
when the card appears; a change of mode re-enumerates the card. The
loopback returns and the six selectors are Pro Audio Mode's. The input
gains and the headphone and OTG volumes are in both: the application's
Mobile Mode screen shows them on the scales these controls use, IN 1
and IN 2 at +26 dB written as 26, AUX at 0.0 dB as 81, BT and OTG IN
at -6.0 dB as 87, the headphone output at -50 dB as 21 and the OTG
output at 0 dB as 99. Mobile Mode gets the two levels it has on the
targets of two of the loopback returns, as the application writes them:

  - PCM Playback Volume, the Playback 1/2 knob: the level of the host's
    playback in the headphones, -90 to +12 dB on 0x53/0x54;
  - Recording Capture Volume, the Recording fader: the level of the
    recording, -90 to 0 dB on 0x51/0x52.

The controls live as long as the card. They are created at the first
bind of the HID driver and stay when it unbinds, unchanged and without
an event: a value written meanwhile is kept, and the next bind writes
back every value. They are not even marked inactive, because alsa-lib's
simple mixer handles an INFO event by removing the element and adding it
again, and a sound server would see the same churn as a removal. So
reloading either driver changes nothing a holder of the card can see --
the controls keep their numids, a stored alsactl state keeps matching
them, a mixer application keeps its elements -- and no control is left
showing a value the card does not hold.

The card's state cannot be read. The card reports what a hand does to
its hardware, every turn of a front-panel knob, and when a session opens
it announces the gains of the inputs that have something plugged in --
of no other input, and never BT's or OTG IN's. A source selector has no
front-panel control and is never reported, nor are Mobile Mode's two
levels, and an output volume is not reported until its knob turns.
Topping were asked for a command that reads the selection and declined
to provide one or to commit to adding one. A host that cannot read these
values has to set them, or it inherits whatever the last host, or a hand
on the panel, left in a battery-powered card, so the first bind writes
all of them and from then on the cache is the truth, which the card's
own reports keep up to date. The gains are no exception: left unwritten,
a gain the card has not reported shows 0, alsactl stores that 0, and its
restore at the next connect writes it back, which mutes AUX, BT and
OTG IN.

The values are the ones the rest of snd-usb-audio would choose rather
than the vendor's. For a volume whose GET_CUR fails, init_cur_mix_raw()
sets the minimum, and the level a user hears is left to userspace --
alsactl and the sound server, which run after the card appears. So the
analogue headphone stage starts at its quiet end; every input gain
starts at 0 dB and the digital stream to a phone at unity, where they
change nothing; and each output listens to the host's main stream,
Playback 1/2, with the mixer out of the path. The loopback returns have
no such default to borrow, so they start where the vendor application
puts them -- on Playback 1/2, Playback 3/4, BT and OTG IN -- at unity
gain. In Mobile Mode, which has no selector to take the mixer out of the
path, the Playback 1/2 knob and the Recording fader start at 0 dB, where
they change nothing: the knob passes the playback's level on to the
headphones as Pro Audio Mode's outputs do, and the fader is at its top.
After a resume the same values are written again from the cache, in case
the card came up on its own defaults, or was changed on its panel, while
the host slept.

The master's context is reached through devres on the audio control
interface rather than through drvdata, which on a usb_interface belongs
to snd-usb-audio itself; devres_find(), keyed on the release function,
gives it back inside the callbacks, which are handed nothing but a
struct device *. It hangs off the control interface rather than off the
USB device because component_match_add() allocates the match list with
devm: on the interface that is released at unbind, while on the
usb_device it would live until the device itself was released and a
rebind would stack a second list on top. The context itself is
reference-counted, held by the mixer until it disconnects and by each
control until the card frees it.

Neither component_compare_dev() nor component_compare_dev_name() fits:
the audio side has no pointer to the HID device, and the HID device's
name carries an instance counter that is not predictable. The match is
therefore one of descent -- the HID device sits two levels below the
USB device -- and which interface it is stays the HID driver's
business, since it registers a component for the vendor interface and
for no other. That keeps sound/usb free of HID symbols and of any
opinion about this card's interface numbering.

component_master_add_with_match() returns 0 with the aggregate merely
pending when the HID driver is absent, so the card comes up either way
and grows the vendor controls if and when the other half appears.
