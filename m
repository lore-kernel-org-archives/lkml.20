Ok, good, I see now that you also cancel the rescan work when the host
is stopped so that seems fine even if the second cancel when freeing the
host is unexpected and bit misleading (as it was added to work around a
driver doing something it should not have).

Looks like you also recently fixed a related issue with sdio interrupt
work which also wasn't stopped (see commit 6feadbecdae6 ("mmc: core:
Cancel SDIO IRQ work before freeing host")).

So I was referring to all work which may still be running after
mmc_remove_host() and potentially call back into the driver being
unbound.

A quick look at a driver using sdio_signal_irq() indicates that this may
still be racy. In dw_mci_remove() the host is removed and clocks
disabled before freeing the host and cancelling the sdio work. A racing
interrupt could have scheduled work that may result in MMIO accesses
with clocks disabled.

Sure, if mmc core guarantees that no callbacks are made despite the work
being left running it should be fine. But that does not seem to be the
case with sdio interrupts currently.

But regardless of any potential races in mmc core, my devres comment is
a more general one: subsystems should not force devres on anyone.
