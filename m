Hm, I'd say it's actually impossible because every unmap operation is
followed by a flush+inval of the GPU L2 and LSC, so for this stale
clean line to exist on the GPU side when a physical page is GPU-mapped
again, it would take a bug in the unmap logic or in the MMU HW, I
think. Am I missing something?

I suppose speculation pre-populating the caches with stale data would be
covered by the flush+inval we do after a map operation (this is
currently done in the unlock path regardless of the VM op, so both map
and unmap get it). I don't know, maybe the goal is to relax the flushing
policy around VM modifications in the future, but if things stay as
they are now, we can assume that a fresh BO being GPU-mapped guarantees
that no cacheline points to it until the first GPU access. But maybe
I'm missing something else...
