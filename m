I don't think Lee or Linus ever asked you to do any conversion of
existing drivers. Just show the example on how things should be done :)

If moving to MFD gives real benefits, these other drivers can be done
later.

TBH, I'm not a big fan of having multiple subsystems children into HID.
Mostly because I can't review the best practive in each of them. However,
for quite a long time, HID was mostly for input devices, and input is a
different subsystem.

That being said, there are 2 types of HID devices:
- ones with defined standard usages (keyboards, mice, touchscreen,
	battery, etc) and using MFD for those would certainly be overthinking
- others use raw HID device with a custom protocol (cp2112, mcp2221,
	ft260), these could be MFD candidates

And of course, we have the exception with the standardly defined sensors
through hid-sensor-hub.c which goes through MFD :)

TL;DR: I'm not opposed to a MFD conversion of hid-ft260.c, nor I'm not
formally pushing towards it. I think we need to take the pragmatic
approach and see if the benefits for it are worth it.

From the description on how the ft260 works and the intrications between
all functions, this seems like a lot of pain to maintain a single core
MFD chip, but not having to maintain I2C, UART, GPIO is appealing.

The question about the cross tree merging is something that can't really
be discussed without having seen the code. Assuming you can split all
the drivers into their own subsystem + MFD HID parent, we could very
well merge the newly additions independently, assuming the MFD HID
parent API is stable enough. The only cross subsystem we need to take
care of today is the existing functionality, but that can be sorted out
by splitting the i2c_adapter part into its own file, and then let the
I2C maintainer move the file into their tree later.

It is maybe a lot to ask, but Michael, can you demo the MFD split on
one/two functionality so we can check which approach is the best?
Ideally 2 features that would be intricating well enough to demonstrate
how hard/easy it would be.

Cheers,
Benjamin
