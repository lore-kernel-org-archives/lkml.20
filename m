I think that makes sense.

The thing that's a bit ugly is that overlayfs open-codes the tail of
sync_filesystems(): ovl_sync_fs() calling upper_sb->s_op->sync_fs() and
sync_blockdev() itself is one more place that needs to know what
sync_filesystem() does.

So we should probably add a helper to fs/sync.c for the ->sync_fs() and
block device part and use that.

Eheeeem, isn't that kind of a bad proxy for this? What ->sync_fs() +
block device do is a property of the upper filesystems and how is that
related to RENAME_WHITEOUT? There's a few counter examples you even
give:

So on ubifs a syncfs() in relaxed mode returns with metadata still in
memory. Meh. I know the flag got droppped but that was an overlayfs
speicfic thing. A generic property of ->sync_fs() is a different thing?

Afaict, creation isn't covered. ovl_instantiate() ends up in
ovl_inode_init() which now uses __ovl_copyattr(). So a new file,
directory, symlink or hardlink only dirties the parent but not the new
overlay inode.

Fine for metadata, but a long symlink isn't metadata. We should mark the
new inode dirty where it's instantiated.

Parking the overlay inode with I_DIRTY_TIME is fine?

So from what I could research:

* ovl_park_inode() calls mark_inode_dirty_sync(). Jan's deferred inode
  reclaim (cf. [1]) removes exactly that from iput() because it does IO
  from dentry reclaim.

  He replaces it with queue_dirtytime_writeback(). That moves the inode
  to the head of b_dirty_time and wakes the flusher.

So it would be nice if we could base your thing on top of Jan's series
(I hope he'll send v2 soon!) and call queue_dirtytime_writeback() thing.

Hm, Jan's series fixes that as well afaict. :)

There's some Sashiko thing btw you should look into?
