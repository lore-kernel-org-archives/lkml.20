> Not sure if I'm testing this right, but with v7.3-rc4 and these two patches scrolling works OK as long as I keep "Scroll Wheel Resolution" in Solaar off. Unlike with unpatched kernel, scrolling doesn't go crazy if I switch between devices. But if I switch "Scroll Wheel Resolution" on, scrolling jumps crazy again.

Hopefully we've got all of the involved people here.

Honestly, this whole situation has been running for too long: Bolt can't
be handled as a DJ receiver, and all the quirks I'm seeing here are
making things even worse, with the "as long as I keep [some user
settings] off".

Bolt in kernel was adding in 7.3, so I'm going to revert it now, and
we'll have to have a fully working plan for an eventual inclusion in a
future kernel version.

Cheers,
Benjamin
