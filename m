On Qualcomm SoCs, both the PLLs and other types of clocks alike require
specific voltage rail levels to operate in-spec, but through the
separation and decentralization of clock and voltage votes, these
requirements are often not met and are never explicitly stated.
This results in clocks being undervolted, or at the very least a state
we're unable to reason about.

The devices consuming these clocks very rarely have their own
requirements in that regard. (1)

This series moves the frequency-power_domain-perf_state mappings inside
the clock drivers, ensuring a single, trusted source of truth is
established and that the silicon is no longer driven at out-of-spec
conditions.

To illustrate the nuances involved, here's a couple examples of hidden
dependencies, as found on SM8650:
* video_cc_mvs0_clk requires LOW_SVS to run at 900 MHz, but the
  PLL it sources the signal from requires SVS (higher corner) to
  produce that frequency. Similarly, to produce 1140 MHz, the clock
  requires SVS, but the PLL then requires SVS_L1.
  Analogous story for mvs1_clk.
* gpu_cc_gmu_clk requires MX to be at SVS to output 625 MHz, the PLL
  requires SVS_L1 to produce that frequency.
* A number of camera clocks follow the same pattern.
* Additionally, some clocks like cam_cc_cci_{0,1,2}_clk require
  MMCX to run at LOW_SVS, but the PLL has the additional requirement
  of keeping MXC (a wholly different rail) at SVS_L1.

There's a broad agreement that a consumer should only have to care
about the clock it consumes, and that configuring its parents is the
responsibility of the CCF. Requiring the consumers to care about the
above cases (as is the expectation today) is a clear violation of
that contract.

A clock controller may have on the order of hundreds of clocks, each
one with its own frequency-power map, and potentially all of them
could be similarly affected.

Recently, some drivers (Iris, CAMSS) have attempted to circumvent these
problems by holding a direct reference to the power rails and managing
the votes manually, through placing direct votes on each rail via an
OPP table. That however has a number of drawbacks:
* Because more than just one clock needs to be scaled at runtime, the
  OPP table either has to contain NUM_CLOCKS * NUM_RATES to handle
  that (which blows up pretty quickly), assume the worst case (and
  waste power), or ignore that problem (and undervolt the clock
  controller), instead of just being able to call set_rate() on each
  clock as needed
* The data ends up being dispersed across various consumers, even
  though it logically belongs to the clock controller, making it
  absolutely unauditable
* It's horrendously error-prone because of the number of clocks
  involved, the depth of the clock tree and the fact that at the end
  of the day, one still has to consult the clock controller
  documentation

The approach proposed here also happens to more naturally fit into the
process of how an SoC is brought up - clock controllers are always
the very first pieces that need to be complete before other IP blocks
can be brought up. And because of (1), enclosing the frequency-corner
data within the clock drivers takes a weight off of everyone else's
shoulders.

On a related topic, the GDSCs are modeled as children of *all* power
domains consumed by a clock controller at once. GDSCs are on/off switches
with some fancy logic attached to them and may need some (or none) rails
enabled to power on or off while meeting the hardware timing
requirements. Voting on them was never quite right in the first place
and is once again only a side-effect of the clocks' power requirements
not being handled centrally.

This series removes the vote propagation and the overly broad parent-
child links, resulting in dropping unnecessary/incorrect votes that are
now encapsulated by the clk-dvfs infrastructure. Big emphasis on (1)
once again.

The implementation is as follows:

Each clock describes the rail levels it needs at each frequency. The
new clk-dvfs helper combines these requirements and submits the
resulting votes through GenPD and RPMHPD. Votes remain held while a
clock is prepared, and rate or parent changes reserve the new
requirements before any clocks are reprogrammed. This also requires CCF
to report programming failures and OPP to retry failed transitions
instead of relying on stale cached state.

Straightening out all of the above lets us tackle another problem
with the upstream description of the power grid - the dependency
between various rails. Most notably:
* CX does NOT need to follow the performance state of MMCX
* MX/MXA/MXC and CX are co-dependent only on some platforms (in coarse
  terms, SM8350 and before)

However, the main part of series needs to land first to ensure that
dropping those relationships doesn't remove some wrongful votes the
system relied on to stay functional. Resolving that will save power and
finally ensure total stability as far as the providers are concerned.

SM8650 is used as an example in this series, but the conversion will
have to be done for all Qualcomm platforms. That will follow soon
after the patches are merged. DFS clocks are left out of this RFC to
reduce noise (the remaining diff is not particularly large but also
requires boilerplate changes to bus drivers).

dt-bindings changes are not included since it's an RFC.
