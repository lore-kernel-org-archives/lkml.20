No-lock allocation may run with preemption disabled or while a raw lock is
held.  On PREEMPT_RT, allocator spinlocks are backed by rtmutexes.  A
successful spin_trylock() can therefore enter priority inheritance or
wakeup code when the lock is released, which is not safe for these callers.

Add spin_trylock_nolock_irqsave() for bounded sections which cannot enter
the rtmutex slow path.  Preemptible callers retain the regular RT trylock.
For a non-preemptible caller, acquire only an uncontended lock, mark the
owner as atomic, and keep preemption and local interrupts disabled until
release.

A regular waiter sets HAS_WAITERS before waiting for an atomic owner.  This
prevents another atomic owner from barging ahead.  The atomic owner
releases to NULL | HAS_WAITERS without entering priority inheritance or
waking a task.  Disabling interrupts while the atomic owner holds the lock
also prevents a waiter from spinning through hardirq work on the owner's
CPU.

The protected section must not block and must remain bounded because a
regular waiter spins with interrupts disabled and cannot boost an atomic
owner.  Document that a successful acquisition must be released with
spin_unlock_irqrestore(), and keep the MM-only entry point unexported.

Pass the real unlock call site to lockdep for both regular and irqrestore
unlocks.  Also make the debug slow unlock publish the free state with
cmpxchg after dropping wait_lock, so an atomic owner cannot reuse an
embedded lock before the old unlock has finished with it.  Use the same
slow-unlock helper in debug and non-debug builds.
