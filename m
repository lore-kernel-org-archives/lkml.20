Hi Nuno,

Thanks for this series though I can't test it because my platforms
disables the ACMD during integration.

I just sent out a series to reduce the cpu load and improve performance
(possibly with powerful system memcpy dma engine), if your platforms
have the suitable memcpy dma engine, can you please try it?

Hi Fei,

can you plz try it too if your platform has suitable memcpy dma engine too?

Thanks
