I see, it's in redhat/kernel.spec.template in the Fedora kernel source
tree which is used when packaging the kernel into an RPM package.
Please make that super clear in your commit message, because it wasn't
clear you were talking about something different from the use in dracut.

I guess the actual diff is fine then, since something like this that's
being used should continue to be allowed.

Of course, this is yet another gratuitous use of AF_ALG, as I've
explained previously
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260504173952.GA2291@sol/).  Depending
AF_ALG to build the kernel (vs. just using OpenSSL for example) is even
more misguided than using it in the integrity check itself, as at least
there are FIPS boundary considerations for the integrity check itself,
but those are irrelevant for the build tools.

So even though this will keep being allowed for now, please work to get
this fixed to not need AF_ALG.  Note also that Fedora 45 explicitly
deprecates AF_ALG (https://lwn.net/Articles/1088489/) on top of the
already-documented upstream deprecation.
