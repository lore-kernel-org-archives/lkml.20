If things are just tightly packed, that's fine and you don't need to
make it a syscon. Just because something looks suspect doesn't mean that
it is actually wrong.

In your shoes, I think what I would do is leave i2c/interrupt
controller/gpios etc all as independent nodes.

I would however model the pinctrl as a single node, with
reg =3D <0xf000001c 0x14>
I think, rather than 5 instances 0x4 wide.

My take would probably be not sending new versions until at least 48h
has passed since the last reply on the current version, rather than 48h
or w/e from time of posting. Of course, exceptions apply, and you can
use common sense to guide you.
