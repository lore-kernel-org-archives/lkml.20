That was just a nasty, still half broken RFC that doesn't really work
(yet), just to see how the rough idea might resonate.

Basically, I think that at the heart of fence's problems are these
issues:

a) fence and fence_context can share a lock
b) thus, the driver often protects driver data with that lock
c) drivers now are allowed to take the fence-lock manually
d) thus, the fence-state cannot consistently be protected with the lock

The fundamental problems were IMO worked around with RCU.

I think if we re-designed dma_fence today, we would do it like that:

a) each fence has its own lock
b) the driver cannot (legally) access a fence-lock
c) the entire fence state is protected by the lock
d) the fence lifetime is completely covered by refcounting
e) signaling is the decoupling point. Signaled-state is guarded by the lock
f) fence->ops access is, through the signaled-state guard, also guarded by =
the lock.
g) all fence API functions are locking-atomic. For example,
   dme_fence_set_error() should not exist, but dma_fence_signal(err)
   should take the code and do all operations while holding the
   lock.

If the driver can never take the lock, then there cannot be a lock
inversion (unless the driver would signal while holding its own lock,
which should be avoidable).


So my idea would have been that, similarly to how you added the
inline_lock a year ago, we add another super_lock to dma_fence, which
is always present, for all users.

We could then add this lock as a second locking layer around the
existing inline / shared lock and implement the rules listed above with
it.

This is just a crazy idea =E2=80=93 it's obviously horribly dangerous and
fragile because of locking order. So I'm not sure if it's worth
exploring further.

But if we had a time-machine I think that's what we would tell
ourselves to do.

In Rust we just obey 100% to the current dma_fence contract. We do use
RCU, and establish the signaled-state as strict decoupling point for
driver-unload.

Since all the code is new, we just don't implement deprecated
callbacks, and we use inline_lock.

I take the fence lock manually where necessary, and sometimes where
half-necessary.

Fence::is_signaled() for example takes and releases the lock like you
do in the AMD code example below, so that all future API users know
with 100% certainty that all callbacks have run once the function
returns true.

(what our Rust design, ironically, solves is ops->signaled() not being
usable for users of drm_sched, because of drm_sched_fence being in
between)

No no, that's not what I mean. Having ops->signaled() is unrelated to
my question.

I'm asking about this:

static inline bool
dma_fence_is_signaled(struct dma_fence *fence)
{
	const struct dma_fence_ops *ops;

	if (dma_fence_test_signaled_flag(fence))
		return true;


You said once that I cannot add lock protection to that if-evaluation.
And IIRC the reason was that someone would complain about performance.
Who is that someone?

That's what I meant: that someone would have to be looping on
dma_fence_is_signaled() to feel the lock.

The reason I want the lock there is that I want to get rid of things
like that:

void amdgpu_vm_fini(struct amdgpu_device *adev, struct amdgpu_vm *vm)
{
	[=E2=80=A6]

	/* Make sure that all fence callbacks have completed */
	dma_fence_lock_irqsave(vm->last_tlb_flush, flags);
	dma_fence_unlock_irqrestore(vm->last_tlb_flush, flags);

We can keep the callback, I think it being there is not a decisive
issue.

Though I don't get why it being there would make things faster. My
understanding so far was that it's only good for parties that do not
signal fences via interrupt.

Who triggers the check via ops->is_signaled()? You once said it's
typically the compositor.

Since you mention Radeon I suppose it can indeed only be drivers that
don't use drm_sched.

I tried to remove them 1-2 years ago and then ran into massive
performance degradations, which indicates that Nouveau uses them for
some performance trick, maybe to reduce interrupt load. Didn't explore
it further.
