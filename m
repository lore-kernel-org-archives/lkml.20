Yes, producing both a high and a low interval requires at least two
ticks, so the shortest non-constant waveform from 24 MHz has an
83.333 ns period, reported as 84 ns.

My 42/0 ns example was a constant-low output, not a toggling 24 MHz
waveform. I should have made that explicit. The manual documents
PWM_ENTIRE_CYCLE =3D 0 as one cycle, and the current rounding helper
includes that setting. For the 42/31 ns request, it calculates one
period tick and zero active ticks.

If we exclude one-tick cycle-mode candidates as well as the 24 MHz
bypass, I agree that the result becomes 40/30 ns using 100 MHz.
Removing the bypass candidates alone does not do that in the current
implementation.
