Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

Lane Margining at the Receiver moves the sampling point of a receiver
away from its normal setting, in time or in voltage, while the link
stays up, and reports the errors the receiver sees.  It is available
on links running at 16.0 GT/s or faster, through the Lane Margining at
the Receiver Extended Capability.

Add a debugfs directory, pcie_lmr_<device>, for each Downstream Port
and each Function 0 below a Downstream Port that has the capability.

Writing 1 to 'enable' starts a margining session on the link.  ASPM is
turned off with pci_disable_link_state(), Hardware Autonomous Width
Disable and Hardware Autonomous Speed Disable are set on both ends,
both ends are kept runtime resumed, and the port's Margining Ready bit
is awaited.  Writing 0, or removing either end of the link, ends the
session and undoes these steps.  Only one session can be active on a
link.

During a session, 'receiver' selects the receiver, laneN/margin_timing
and laneN/margin_voltage issue Step Margin commands, laneN/caps shows
the parameters the receiver reports, and laneN/status shows the
response to the last step command, including the error count.  Before
each command, the link is checked against the state the session
started in: speed, width, Margining Ready, ASPM still off, and no
system suspend since.

The kernel does not run margining sweeps or interpret the results;
that is left to user space.

+====================================
+PCIe Lane Margining at the Receiver
+====================================
+
+Lane Margining at the Receiver lets software move the sampling point of a
+receiver away from its normal setting, in time or in voltage, while the link
+stays up, and read back the number of errors the receiver sees.  It is
+available on links running at 16.0 GT/s or faster, through the Lane Margining
+at the Receiver Extended Capability.
+
+With ``CONFIG_PCIE_LMR``, the kernel exposes the margining commands of each
+port that has the capability in debugfs.  The kernel does not run margining
+sweeps or interpret results; user-space tools do that.
+
+debugfs layout
+==============
+
+There is one directory per port that has the capability::
+
+  /sys/kernel/debug/pcie_lmr_<domain:bus:dev.fn>/
+      enable
+      receiver
+      port
+      lane0/
+          caps
+          margin_timing
+          margin_voltage
+          status
+      lane1/
+      ...
+
+The capability is used on Downstream Ports, and on Function 0 of the device
+below a Downstream Port.  There is one ``laneN`` directory for each lane of
+the port's Maximum Link Width.
+
+``enable``
+  Write 1 to start a margining session on the link, 0 to end it.  Both are
+  accepted when the port is already in that state.  Reads return 1 while a
+  session started on this port is active, and 0 otherwise.
+
+  Starting a session turns off the ASPM states that are enabled on the link,
+  sets Hardware Autonomous Width Disable and Hardware Autonomous Speed Disable
+  on both ends, keeps both ends runtime resumed, and waits for Margining
+  Ready.  Ending the session undoes these steps and returns every lane that
+  was margined to normal settings.
+
+  Only one session can be active on a link at a time.  A session is ended by
+  writing 0 to ``enable`` in the directory where it was started.
+
+``receiver``
+  The Receiver Number (1 to 6) that commands are sent to.  A Downstream Port
+  reaches receiver 1 (its own receiver) and, when retimers are present,
+  receivers 2 and 3 for the first retimer and 4 and 5 for the second.
+  Function 0 below a Downstream Port reaches only receiver 6 (its own
+  receiver).  A session starts with receiver 1 or 6.  Selecting another
+  receiver first returns the lanes margined by the current one to normal
+  settings.
+
+``port``
+  Margining Port Capabilities and Status bits: ``uses_driver_software``,
+  ``margining_ready`` and ``software_ready``.  This file can be read without a
+  session.
+
+``laneN/caps``
+  The parameters the selected receiver reports for the lane, one ``key:
+  value`` pair per line.  The values are read from the receiver the first time
+  the file is read or a step is written in a session, and again after the
+  receiver changes.  ``max_lanes`` is the number of lanes that can be margined
+  at the same time.
+
+``laneN/margin_timing``, ``laneN/margin_voltage``
+  Write a number of steps to move the sampling point of the selected receiver
+  on this lane.  Negative values move left or down and are accepted only when
+  the receiver supports independent left/right timing or up/down voltage
+  margining.  Writing 0 returns the lane to normal settings; because that
+  clears both offsets, the other offset is then applied again.  Reads return
+  the offset that was last applied.
+
+``laneN/status``
+  The receiver's response to the last step command on this lane, as
+  ``<timing|voltage> <setup|margining|too_many_errors|nak> <error count>``,
+  or ``idle`` when the last command was not a step command.  Reading this
+  file does not send a command.
+
+All files are only accessible to root.
+
+Example
+=======
+
+Measure one timing step to the right on lane 0, from a Downstream Port::
+
+  # cd /sys/kernel/debug/pcie_lmr_0000:00:01.1
+  # echo 1 > enable
+  # cat lane0/caps
+  receiver: 1
+  ...
+  # echo 1 > lane0/margin_timing
+  # sleep 1; cat lane0/status
+  timing margining 0
+  # echo 0 > lane0/margin_timing
+  # echo 0 > enable
+
+Errors
+======
+
+Reads and writes return these errors in addition to the usual parsing errors:
+
+=================  ===========================================================
+``-ENOTCONN``      No session is active on this port.
+``-EBUSY``         Another session is active on the link, the port or its
+                   link partner is being probed, removed or reset (try again),
+                   too many lanes are margined already, or ASPM was found
+                   enabled on the link.
+``-ENODEV``        The link partner is missing or was removed, or the device
+                   does not respond.
+``-ENOLINK``       The link is down.
+``-EOPNOTSUPP``    The link runs below 16.0 GT/s, the receiver does not
+                   support voltage margining, or it answered a step command
+                   with a NAK.
+``-ERANGE``        The step count is larger than the receiver supports.
+``-EINVAL``        A negative step that the receiver does not support, or a
+                   receiver number that is not reachable from this port.
+``-EIO``           The receiver reported too many errors immediately on a step
+                   command and was returned to normal settings, or the link
+                   changed speed or width, lost Margining Ready, or went
+                   through system suspend since the session started.
+``-ETIMEDOUT``     Margining Software Ready is not set, Margining Ready was
+                   not set within the timeout, or the receiver did not respond
+                   to a command (for example on an inactive lane).
+=================  ===========================================================
+
+Limitations
+===========
+
+- ASPM is turned off and back on with ``pci_disable_link_state()`` and
+  ``pci_force_enable_link_state()``, like drivers that need ASPM off for a
+  while.  This round trip is not exact:
+
+  - If another driver disables an ASPM state during a session, ending the
+    session turns it back on.
+  - The ASPM default for the link becomes the set of states that were enabled
+    when the session started.
+  - Disabling L1 also disables the L1 substates, so substates that were
+    disabled at the start stay disabled.
+  - Without OS control of ASPM, the states are turned off but cannot be turned
+    back on, and stay off until reboot.
+
+  If nothing was enabled when the session started, the ASPM API is not called
+  at all.  Before each command the ASPM Control field of both ends is checked,
+  so a session does not continue if ASPM was turned back on, for example
+  through the ``link/*_aspm`` files in sysfs.
+
+- Receivers lose their margining state over system suspend.  Commands on a
+  session that was active before a suspend fail with ``-EIO``.
+
+- One receiver is margined at a time.  The error count limit is the
+  receiver's default; the kernel does not set it.
+
+- Another program writing the Lane Margining registers directly, such as
+  ``pcilmr`` or ``setpci``, will interfere with a session.
