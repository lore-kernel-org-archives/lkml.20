When a lease break has waited for fs.lease-break-time,
nfsd4_layout_lm_breaker_timedout() has the client that holds the layout
fenced before the breaker goes on.  For a layout type without
->fence_client, which is the block layout, it returns true at once: the
lease is removed and the operation on the server goes on while the
client still holds the layout.  /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed, which
Documentation/admin-guide/nfs/pnfs-block-server.rst names as the way to
fence such a client, is only run when the CB_LAYOUTRECALL fails.

This hits a client that keeps answering the recall with NFS4_OK or
NFS4ERR_DELAY for longer than fs.lease-break-time, 45 seconds by
default, for example because its path to the device is cut.  With the
previous patch the recall is polled for two lease periods, 180 seconds
by default, so the lease break times out first.  A Linux client before
v6.8 answers that way (read from the code, not run), and with the next
patch every Linux client is polled that way; until now a client from
v6.8 on has the recall fail after 10 ms.

Let the fence worker run the script for a layout type without
->fence_client, and give up the lease after that.  As on the recall
failure path, the exit status of the script is not looked at.  The
same document says that the server retries a failed fence and keeps
the file from other clients meanwhile; that is what the fence worker
does with ->fence_client().  Doing it for the script would block the
file for good on a server that has no /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed, so
this patch leaves it as the recall failure path has it.

As for the SCSI layout since the commit this fixes, the client is then
fenced after fs.lease-break-time.  That is shorter than one lease
period by default, while RFC 8881 section 12.5.5 has the server wait
one lease period after a recall before it takes further action.
Setting fs.lease-break-time to at least the lease time gives that wait
for both layout types.

The fence worker now runs the script with UMH_WAIT_PROC, and since
"nfsd: drain pNFS fence work during state teardown" tearing down the
client waits for the fence worker.  A script that expires the client it
fences, through /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/*/ctl, would therefore wait for
itself.  That is already so on the recall failure path, where the script
runs while the callback is in flight and the teardown waits for the
callbacks (read from the code, not run).

Tested together with the next patch: a client writing through a block
layout whose path to the device is cut for 70 seconds while it can
still talk to the server, default lease and lease break times, and a
4 KiB write to the file on the server.  Without this patch the write
on the server goes on after 47 seconds and /sbin/nfsd-recall-failed is
not run.  With it the script is run after 47 seconds and the write goes
on then.  In both runs the client returns the layout when its path is
back, and the recall completes.

Fixes: f52792f484ba ("NFSD: Enforce timeout on layout recall and integrate lease manager fencing")
