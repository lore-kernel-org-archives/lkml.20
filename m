The idea is that it is used temporarily to communicate from the
page allocator to the caller "This only succeeded because of
PF_MEMALLOC".  Making it a page flag would require all callers be
aware of it -- most simply do not care.  PF_MEMALLOC was set on
their behalf and there is nothing they can usefully do with this
information.

So we want to communicate it in a way that allows the unaware caller to
discard the information, and I chose bit 1 of page->lru.next.  We
used to use page->index == -1UL (which was also naturally overwritten by
the unaware caller), but we needed to have it be part of PP_SIGNATURE
and that needed to be not part of page->index ...

Commit dc8cf7550a70 if you want to read more about it.

We do use a page flag in slab; we check the pfmalloc bit and move it
into a page flag (SL_pfmemalloc).  But we don't use it for folios.

While there is a folio_is_pfmemalloc(), I think that was a mistake
and it should now be deleted.  It hasn't been used since slab was
converted away from folios last November.

That's the correct thinking.

How about this patch?
