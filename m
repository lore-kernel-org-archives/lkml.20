OK, got it!

Just to clarify, most of the patches in this pull request are
fixes or patches that were taken well before the merge window but
had to wait for some dependencies to be resolved. They have also
been tested in my -next branch for several -rc cycles now.

Since the merge window opened, I've added only two patches that
are not strictly fixes[*]. One is a trivial fix that doesn't
deserve a Fixes: tag, while the other has been properly reviewed
and in my tree for almost a week.

So, apart from this last patch, which I could drop to be fully
compliant, I believe this pull request meets your requirements.

Am I still missing something? Is there anything I can still do?

As for my mention of a possible third week and a part 3 (not this
part 2 pull request!), I was simply trying to check whether that
would be acceptable for trivial patches. I understand now that it
definitely isn't.

Thanks,
Andi
