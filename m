The upcoming DRM_MODE_ATOMIC_RESET flag will need to create an atomic
commit that brings the entire device back to a pristine state, as if
no configuration had ever been applied.

Create drm_atomic_commit_fill_with_defaults() which iterates over all
CRTCs, planes, connectors, and color operations in the device and
inserts a fresh default state for each one into the commit. This uses
the atomic_create_state() hooks rather than atomic_duplicate_state(),
since atomic_create_state() provides exactly this pristine state on a
per-object basis.
