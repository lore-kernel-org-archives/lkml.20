Based on the discussion at LPC, we came to the conclusion that this is
the path forward.

Before reviewing the code, here's an idea that Pasha briefly brought up
briefly at LPC, and I more or less agree. I'd like other opinions on
this.

Should we make the interface more generic by allowing userspace to pass
extra arguments to PRESERVE_FD and RETRIEVE_FD? This effectively gives
each file handler an additional uAPI of its own. The upside is that it
would be more extensible and we should be able to accommodate more use
cases with this. The memfd/shmem extra uAPI will take an optional target
file to retrieve into.

For example, the guest_memfd patches might use this to tell the KVM FD
to retrieve the guest_memfd into. Of course, KVM needs to see if this
makes sense (alternative being preserving the KVM FD too), but this is
just an example of how it might be used. I think VFIO also does some
workarounds by using an anon inode on retrieve. It perhaps might be
useful there too, though I don't understand that problem well enough to
talk in more detail.

I suppose we should rename all the memfd_luo_* stuff to shmem_luo_*?

The latest guidelines per Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst
seem to be "Assisted-by: LLM".

Although in _my_ opinion, I'd reckon most patches these days are
assisted by an LLM. The code might not necessarily be generated by an
LLM, but I think a large majority of developers use LLMs in some
capacity during patch development. So "Assisted-by: LLM" doesn't add any
value to me. Other people seem to find it useful, so please do feel free
to add it to your patches.
