In general we never want LLM-generated commit messages/comments.

I do however obviously appreciate and empathise with using it to assist
non-native speakers. So that's fine, but ideally you would write it up yourself
and then have the LLM do simply a polishing layer, keeping the length as small
as possible, which should give us the best of both worlds. Thanks :)

It is too verbose yes, and effectively writes out the code in comment form, this
is not helpful.

In general I'd prefer a rethink though to make it cleaner.

Completely disagree. By this logic we'd never improve anything, and even if it
were true, it's valid to say there should be a feature freeze until that's fixed.

Anyway, let's work through this a bit.

At 50,000 ft:

static struct ksm_rmap_item *scan_get_next_rmap_item(struct page **page)
{
	...

	if (mm_slot == &ksm_mm_head) {
		... huge block ...
next_mm:
		... of course, nasty non-linear goto logic ...
	}

	for_each_vma(vmi, vma) {
		...
		while (ksm_scan.address < vma->vm_end) {
			...
			if (tmp_page) {
				... <-- you propose to add open-coded logic in
				        the most nested bit.
			}
			...
		}
		...
	}
	... huge amounts of other code ...
}

Now very clearly you can separate out these blocks into static functions with
no risk at all and eliminate most of this indentation.

Digging into your proposal:

			if (tmp_page) {
				flush_anon_page(vma, tmp_page, ksm_scan.address);
				flush_dcache_page(tmp_page);
+				if (should_skip_non_zero_page(ksm_scan.rmap_list,
+						     ksm_scan.address, folio,
+						     tmp_page)) {
+					folio_put(folio);
+					ksm_scan.address += PAGE_SIZE;
+					mmap_read_unlock(mm);
+					return ERR_PTR(-EAGAIN);
+				}
				rmap_item = get_next_rmap_item(mm_slot,
					ksm_scan.rmap_list, ksm_scan.address);
				if (rmap_item) {
					ksm_scan.rmap_list =
							&rmap_item->rmap_list;

					if (should_skip_rmap_item(folio, rmap_item)) {
						folio_put(folio);
						goto next_page;
					}

					ksm_scan.address += PAGE_SIZE;
					*page = tmp_page;
				} else {
					folio_put(folio);
				}
				mmap_read_unlock(mm);
				return rmap_item;
			}

Firstly, in context, this is:

			...
			if (tmp_page) {
				...
			}
next_page:
			ksm_scan.address += PAGE_SIZE;
			cond_resched();

Right?

So this could be:

			if (!tmp_page)
				goto next_page;

			... logic in block above ...


With zero risk and immediately you remove one level of indentation.

Since you're returning rmap_item anyway you could do:

			if (should_skip_non_zero_page(ksm_scan.rmap_list,
				ksm_scan.address, folio, tmp_page)) {
				ksm_scan.address += PAGE_SIZE;
				rmap_item = ERR_PTR(-EAGAIN);
			} else {
				rmap_item = get_next_rmap_item(mm_slot,
					ksm_scan.rmap_list, ksm_scan.address);
			}

Then:
			if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(rmap_item)) {
				...
			} else {
				folio_put(folio);
			}
			mmap_read_unlock(mm);
			return rmap_item;

Which does the mmap_read_unlock(), address update and return for you.

IMO none of this is risky, and this isn't even getting into bigger
refactorings you could do.

Adding a few of these kinds of things as patches early in the series really
isn't that hard and improves things for everybody.

I'd love for this to be an instinctive thing people did when adding new
functionality to stuff like this. That way we pay down technical debt as we
go :)
