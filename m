Yeah, that's a good question.

Right, eventually.  But that will take a while, plus it's preferable
to have the documentation as close as possible to the things you'd be
looking at when it becomes relevant.

So, for starters, I think your commit messages should include this
kind of context and rationale at the point the concepts are introdcued
to the code.  It also might make sense to have some of this  in
comments in fdt.h.  We haven't done much of that so far, but providing
more detail around the bare structure and constant definitions is
probably worthwhile.

I'm guessing that's with the assumption that the bootloader is making
at least minor changes to the tree?  Certainly a tree with unknown
tags can be forwarded unmodified.

TBH, I'm finding it pretty hard to follow what Rob's saying there.  It
does help me understand some things you've said elsewhere.

Only if we assume "skippable" tags are always optional.  Making this
assumption means we can't, for example, say: from v23, all properties
_must_ have an FDT_XXX metadata tag.  Constraining future versions
that way seems undesirable to me, since a number of previous revisions
exist to say "you can count on this particular information being
present".  That's been in the form of extra header fields previously,
but I think the same principle applies.  e.g.  it seems like it would
be pretty useful to tell an addon aware bootloader "if version >=3D NNN
then you can rely on all necessary fixup tags being present.

Sure, it's pretty clear than anything that would alter the tree
structure can't be skipped.  But the constraints on what needs to be
dropped on what sorts of modification constrict things substantially
further.  For example. the fact that property modifications don't
affect node tags means it wouldn't be possible to have a node tag
which was, say, "total number of properties in this subtree".  That's
a contrived example, obviously, but it's not obvious to me there
wouldn't be some use for "summary" tags of this nature, that is,
something which collates information for an entire node or subtree for
quick reference.

It breaks the principle of least surprise, though.  Especially since
we don't have a "strip nops" function (aside: that would be a nice
addition).

I don't think it's actually that much more complex.  You already have
to deal with tree splicing in this case.

Not in this function, AFAICT.  I assume the callers ensure this, but
that's not obvious when looking just at this code.  I'd prefer to see
this checked here (unless can_assume(ASSUME_LIBFDT_FLAWLESS))
returning FDT_ERR_INTERNAL if it fails.

Yes, but I get nervous whenever I see a non-exhaustive check on a

Yes, exactly, that's why I'm saying it would make more sense to use
the iterator that *doesn't* skip unknown tags (whatever it gets called).

No, *unknown* (by this libfdt version) tags are nopped.  Known
skippable tags are left unaltered.  Presumably they would then apply
to the previous property, which is definitely wrong.

That would be good, but it's not the issue I'm pointing out above.

Again, all skippable tags on the property need to be nopped, not just
unknown ones.  Otherwise they'll stay there and now apply to the
previous property.

Certainly.

fdtdump is an issue - it's a sometimes-useful hack, not a tool to be
relied on.  What would probably make more sense here is a
'dtbs_equal_with_tags' or something, that performs a stricter
comparison that the existing dtbs_equal_ordered.

Yes, but how does that relate to the use of fdtput?

Sure.  Again, seems like what you want is a dtbs_equal_with_tags.
