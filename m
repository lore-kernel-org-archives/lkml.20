I, at least, have no new suggestions. I thought the most recent reply
=66rom Guenter was pretty clear? If you've got a dedicated fan controller
with static association then you don't need to provide the association,
but if there's dynamic/configurable pwm-tach then you need to provide
the association so that the fan controller can work correctly?
To me, that read as if the pwms property would be required here, because
what's proposed above represents the same fan twice, as pwm-fan0 and
fan0 without an association between the two because you have an
different IP entirely providing the pwm.

For this to work, don't you actually need to do:
pwm0: pwm {
	compatible =3D "starfive,jhb100-pwm";
};

fan-controller {
	compatible =3D "starfive,jhb100-fan-tach";
=09
	fan@0 {
		pwms =3D <&pwm0 0 40000 0>;
		tach-ch =3D <0x0>, <0x8>;
	};
};

Cheers,
Conor.
