No, it depends on four things.  The three things you listed, plus uarch-specific
ordering of checks and loads of guest state.  The SDM says:

  the following operations take place concurrently:
  
    (1) the guest-state area of the VMCS is checked to ensure that, after the
        VM entry completes, the state of the logical processor is consistent
	with IA-32 and Intel 64 architectures;
    (2) processor state is loaded from the guest-state area or as specified by
        the VM-entry control fields; and (3) address-range monitoring is cleared.

  Because the checking and the loading occur concurrently, a failure may be
  discovered only after some state has been loaded. For this reason, the logical
  processor responds to such failures by loading state from the host-state area,
  as it would for a VM exit.

So KVM is well within its rights to load vmcs01 state from vmcs12 even on VM-Exit
due to a failed VM-Entry.  More at the very bottom (below the first diff).

This works, but IMO is unnecessarily convoluted.  KVM doesn't need to manually
query vmcs12 entry controls, we can and should instead call sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12()
in the failed VM-Entry path if vmcs02 has been prepared with vmcs12 state.  Then
the only thing that needs to be communicated to load_vmcs12_host_state() is
whether or not vmcs02 was prepared.  This would make KVM consistent with how it
handles guest state on failed VM-Entry VM-Exits that occur because of hardware's
consistency checks (KVM only validates a subset of guest state).

So I'm fairly certain it's just the below change (I also tweaked the comment about
CET state because it's not at all obvious why vmcs12 would hold the correct state).

As for nitpicking the SDM, KVM doesn't *need* to wait until prepare_vmcs02()
completes cleanly, KVM just needs to guarantee that vmcs12 holds the correct state
if L2 state is loaded from vmcs12 on VM-Exit.  Because even on failure,
prepare_vmcs02() has already loaded (most) guest state into vmcs02.  So we could
sync vmcs02=>vmcs12 on any failure after switching to vmcs02, if we adjusted
prepare_vmcs02() to fully prepare vmcs02 before do its final consistency checks.
I.e. we could do the below on top.

However, as much as I want to be pedantic on this point, I don't think we should
actually do the below.  I combed through the flows and can't find anything that
would result in loading the wrong L1 state if KVM mostly prepares vmcs02 but
doesn't do sync_vmcs02_to_vmcs12().  And marking vmcs02 as prepared if and only
if it's fully prepared is much more obviously correct.
