Hi Yazen,

Thanks for your feedback!

It was intended only to limit the scope of the change and address the
Sashiko finding, but it does not provide the AMD SMN code with a valid
Hygon node-to-root mapping. I will drop the model-specific check.

Not quite. By stopping the affected call sites, I meant removing the
Hygon match entries from the drivers which currently route them through
the AMD NB or SMN mapping. I did not mean adding complete Hygon EDAC,
ATL and k10temp support in this series. These paths do not provide
usable Hygon support with the current AMD node mapping.

Those implementations depend on the Hygon node and SMN interfaces. The
intended order is:

   1. add the Hygon node interfaces;
   2. stop the affected Hygon drivers from entering the AMD paths;
   3. make AMD NB and SMN initialization AMD-only;
   4. add the Hygon SMN implementation.

EDAC, ATL and temperature monitoring support can then be submitted
separately using the Hygon interfaces. This ordering addresses the v3
Sashiko concern without making those drivers a prerequisite for the
node layer.

I agree that X86_FEATURE_ZEN describes the core architecture and should
not be used to select an interconnect implementation. A separate
interconnect capability may be useful, but defining it and converting
its users would be broader than this node series. For this series, I
would prefer to use explicit vendor checks and keep the interconnect
capability work separate.

That is the ordering I intended.
