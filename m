The issue is the resulting mmap in the kernel- we can end up mapping
MMIO regions that don't tolerate side-effects with NormalNC attributes on arm64
(that's what WC is on arm64 and in turn WC is detected in places - eg sysfs -
through IORESOURCE_PREFETCH), which can end up in mayhem because those mappings
allow eg speculative reads.

Hopefully, this is not an issue in kernel drivers because drivers *should* know
what a BAR is and should ignore the resource flag as far as mem mappings are
concerned.

Indeed, I don't want to speak for Ard but that's exactly a couple of places
where things can go haywire. Then there is PCI drivers even though I don't
think we should have a problem there but as Ard replied, who knows, see above.
