So, in that case the term "skippable" tags makes sense.

Any non-skippable tag are then defined using the "old style".

The only non-skippable tag that will be introduce later by addons is
FDT_BEGIN_NODE_REF (patch 51/71 [1]).

Data related to this tag is the symbol name and so a string.

Using the "old style" for this tag, I will remove the 32-bit data lengh.
The next tag will be after the end of string '\0' + potential alignment.

This is consistent with "old style" tags which have a string as data. Indedd
no 32-bit data lengh were present for those "old style" tags.

Does it make sense on your side?

I don't understand. What do you mean ?

Current implementation for skipping tags is not so complex.

Do you mean that we should avoid the DATA_LEN_ENCODING and always have the
32-bit value right after the tag to give the size for all "skippable" tags?
