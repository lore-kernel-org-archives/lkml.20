Subject: [PATCH RFC 08/12] nfs: keep the dentry of a shared-parent removal hashed

With the directory locked shared, a removal stays ordered against
lookups and opens of the same name only through the name's dentry,
whose ->d_revalidate() waits while the dentry is marked.  Three paths
act on a cached dentry without that wait: nfs_prime_dcache(), which
unhashes a dentry that a directory listing disagrees with and
otherwise refreshes its inode from the listing; nfs4_file_open() when
the open fails; and recovery of open state.  Make each of them leave
a dentry marked by such a removal alone, so that it stays hashed until
the removal itself deletes it, and so that a listing that may predate
the removal does not stop the removal from dropping the link count.

Have nfs_prime_dcache() also leave alone a dentry that has been
unhashed.  When the listing holds a reference, a successful removal
unhashes the dentry, rather than making it negative, before it clears
the mark, and a refresh from a listing that predates the removal could
then put back the link count that the removal took away.  Without that
reference the removal makes the dentry negative instead, and the
listing treats the name as one it has no dentry for: the case that
"nfs: do not cache a name from a listing that a removal overlapped"
handles.

Of the three, only the listing runs beside such a removal by design,
since it holds the directory shared too.  The other two hold no
directory lock, and can meet a marked dentry only through a reference
taken after it was marked, by a path that does not wait for the mark:
an open by file handle, which NFSv4.1 and later mounts support.  A
lockless path walk that checked the dentry before it was marked fails
its recheck and retries, because marking it also invalidates the
dentry's sequence count.

Nothing marks a dentry this way yet, so the one change is that
nfs_prime_dcache() leaves alone a dentry that something else has
unhashed, rather than refreshing its inode or caching a replacement
for it.
