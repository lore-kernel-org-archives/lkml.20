I am not sure if it's better.
But if people prefer independent to extra, I would use TDX_CFG_INDEPENDENT_F()
instead.

OK, I will drop them to avoid confusion.

Yes, there is overlap between them.
If split into two categories, it would be:
- Features forced to zero when #VE is reduced, which also lack KVM support
- Features unrelated to #VE reduction that lack KVM support

Because the changelog was already getting quite long, I combined them into a
single category.

#VE is reduced means the guest reduced the related #VE, i.e. TDCS.TD_CTRL.REDUCE_VE
is 1 and the related bit in TDCS.FEATURE_PARAVIRT_CTRL is 0.

X86_FEATURE_CID, Context ID, more specifically, L1 CONTEXT ID

X86_FEATURE_PBE, Pending Break Enable.

Since kernel already has X86_FEATURE_XXX for them, so I use them directly without
other description.

If the guest set TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE, write 1 to the the related bit trigger #GP.
If the guest doesn't set TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE, the value is passed to KVM, and
KVM will save the value without do corresponding virtualization.

Considering TDCS.TD_CTLS.REDUCE_VE is set by the Linux guest by default, it should
not allow these features.

The guest could be other OS, not just Linux.

I was doing this patch series based on the latest CSV version of the CPUID
virtualization document from "Intel TDX Module ABI Definitions" updated in June 2026.

Because excluding some bits changes the ABI, I listed all these directly configurable
features out of kvm_cpu_caps[] to explain why we must exclude some bits.
