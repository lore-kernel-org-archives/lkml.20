Hi Jiaxing,

I want to get soon to review this and the other pending rocket series,
and in the meantime something that could help this moving would be to
get a review from Sashiko.

As you can see in [0], Sashiko is not reviewing this series because it
doesn't not understand yet prerequisite-patch-id. Can you please
resubmit the series with Igor's (presumably) patches bundled in it?

[0] https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260831040804.24111-1-gahing%40gahingwo=
o.com

Thanks,

Tomeu
