Basically. The firmware knows the platform better than the OS, so if it
produces a resource allocation with non-prefetchable PCIe BARs in
prefetchable bridge windows, there is a good chance this was deliberate.

I can assure you you are not the only one running 'git grep'.

But I feel that presenting non-prefetchable BARs as prefetchable in every
respect just to simplify our logic wrt bridge window placement is not the
right approach. We must assume that non-prefetchable BARs may have side
effects on read - we are just relying on the fact that PCIe ports modeled
as PPBs will never perform readahead through their prefetchable windows.

For instance, such non-prefetchable BARs will end up having resourceN_wc
sysfs nodes created for them. They will also become mmap()'able with
WC attributes through /proc/bus/pci (via proc_bus_pci_mmap()).

Yeah this is getting complicated very quickly :-)

So I take it you prefer to address this as a single feature, rather than
starting out by being more permissive when preserving the existing resou=
rce
allocation?
