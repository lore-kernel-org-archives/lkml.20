No, no. As I wrote in the previous patch too, this is a *bug*, and not
"supported". Please don't treat it as such. Tell your LLM to also not
treat it as such ;-)

This patch doesn't do "Allow preserving tmpfs files that are still
linked", it does "Allow preserving tmpfs files".

That makes sense, but can you do it for memfd as well please, as a
preparatory patch?

I've stopped reading it by this point. Sounds too LLM-ey. Please try
to make this easier to read for humans.

For example, why are we even talking about FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY? I
reckon you have it in your chat as an example to draw design from, but
then LLMs have a tendency to leak those information in patch logs. I
usually spawn a subagent with clean context and a high level description
of the goal to review the changes and changelogs, to clean up these
things, and then of course review everything manually.

Same thing in your comments.

Please clean them up.

Why are you talking about preserving binaries being executed? Seems
oddly specific. I didn't know that was a use case we cared about.

Please rework this whole block, it's unreadable.

Nit: can you move these conditions up, and directly return 0 there? Much
more readable.
