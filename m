It'd always be 3rd party if Eswin doesn't accept it. The Linux kernel
cannot deliver such a hacked firmware.

All DMA peripherals on EIC7700 is non-coherent, but some of them will
still work without uncached mapping.

Only peripherals that really share the same buffer between CPU and the
device will be affected, because otherwise the coherency is kept by
cache maintenance instead of uncached mapping. (Display framebuffer is
a borderline situation -- it is accessed by the CPU and the DC in the
same time, but the DC does read-only access, so manual cache
maintenance is still doable although with price).

I think the major problem of Samuel's method is that it's invasive to
other kernel subsystems, which would make the review time much much
longer; but I still expect it.

(A minor problem is that his mail server is too strict -- on SPF rules,
which prevented his mails to be forwarded by mailing lists.)
