I just want to make it clear that "active" and "suspended" are
abstract and not tied to any specific device states in principle.
Maybe this is obvious.

Fair enough.

This is a matter of personal preference.

So you can just drop the "meta-" prefix here and elsewhere below if
you think that the meaning of "state" is clear enough.  It's up to you
though.
