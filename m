kvm_vm_dead() should only be used when KVM *needs* to prevent userspace fro=

running the VM.

But QEMU isn't KVM.  While QEMU is the de facto reference VMM, it's importa=
nt to
keep in mind that it's not the only VMM (and that's not just about Google's=
 VMM,
there are plenty of other non-QEMU VMMs that are used in production environ=
ments).

If TDX selftests don't fail due to an unexpected KVM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN, then th=
at needs
to be fixed irrespective of this change.

Yes, but that holds true for literally every guest failure.  It's like sayi=
ng that
all observed errors could be due to a CPU bug, e.g. because the CPU corrupt=
ed state
or because a bit flipped in DRAM.  It's technically true, but in practice t=
he vast
majority of failures (outside of pre-production hardware) are software erro=
rs, and
so absent evidence that a hardware/VMM/KVM bug is at play, KVM shouldn't as=
sume
anything.  I.e. as above, unless KVM needs to protect itself, KVM should aw=
ays try
to provide semantics that are rooted in the CPU architecture.

E.g. an analogous failure would for non-TDX guests would be if the host zer=
oed a
page that happened to be necessary to handle exceptions in the guest, and a=
s a
result the guest hit a triple fault shutdown.  KVM doesn't return -EIO inst=
ead of
KVM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN just because the failure could have been introduced by a =
kernel
or VMM bug.
