FWIW, one not-yet-merged user is this patch that disables ASPM around 
link retraining for bwctrl on host controllers that do require that:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260819-bwscale-v5-1-6dea79786b37@oss.qualcomm.com/

That particular version of the patch was already written assuming 
symmetric enable/disable and I hit that when testing it, so here's an 
example of the potential trouble :)


Naming suggestion: if it ends up being that counter thing, it should use 
the verb "inhibit", like idle inhibitors in userspace. Those are 
commonly understood to be counter-based ("as long as there's at least 
one inhibitor, the state is disabled") and temporary.
