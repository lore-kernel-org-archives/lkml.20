Huh.  TIL that pcie-rcar-gen4.c refers to the 4th generation R-Car
SoCs (and, I guess the point of this series is to add support for 5th
generation SoCs), not to PCIe Gen4 link speeds.  I see that
"renesas,rcar-genX" is all over the place in 'compatible' strings, so
I guess we should follow that precedent.

If the "renesas,rcar-gen5" SoC includes both PCIe Gen4 and PCIe Gen6
cores, I suppose everybody refers to them as pcie-gen4 and pcie-gen6,
so the "renesas,rcar-gen5-pcie4" you used is probably the obvious
choice.

But maybe we can make commit logs less confusing by saying things
like:

  - R-Car Gen4 SoCs S4/V4H/V4M
  - R-Car Gen5 SoC X5H
  - the R-Car Gen5 SoC PCIe Gen4 core
  - the R-Car R8A78000 X5H PCIe Gen4 core, which supports a x8 link at
    16 GT/s
