Hibernate but we need to reject this as well since there's no way you
can save and restore the realm memory.

That's the aim but proposed KVM/CCA support still allows non-gmem slots
to end up delegated (I haven't checked the latest if addressed).

I do wonder what we gain from unmapping. If architecturally we get a
synchronous fault when accessing delegated pages, it's only marginally
more code to do_gpf() (and we might need this function anyway for
kdump) and we avoid linear map fragmentation. So, I think we just need
to agree what's fatal and what can safely recover. We do need Alper's
patch for kdump, otherwise we can't fix it up in do_gpf().
