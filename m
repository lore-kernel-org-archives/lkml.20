tbh, I don't think this has anything to do with adc.yaml or ADC
channels, the channel that I was talking about here was the channel on
the backend since in Figure 349 the serial interfaces can select between
the two clocks but also select to be clocked by the MDF_CKIx input. We
definitely have some properties about that are used by devices to change
between clock sources - I just dunno if any of them have that capability
on a per-channel basis.

If it was just about interleaving, I don't think you'd need two of them,
since only one set of interleaved channels is possible? There's also the
option I mentioned of having the MDF_CKIx be the clock. Maybe being a
clock controller is actually the right thing to do, just with the
frontend sdmodulator or w/e connected to the SITFx being the consumer?
In that case, you'd need to do something to actually represent the clock
mux in dt, one mux per SITFx, leaving us with N output clocks from
CLK_SITF0 to CLK_SITFx rather than two because we're thinking in terms
of programming model not physical outputs. Additionally, the number of
input clocks grows by N since MDF_CKIx are all parents of the muxes.
You'd then use assigned-clock-parents from the frontend node to set the
parent of the mux (I think anyway). I'd be a little afraid of creating a
loop there though, that needs to be broken, if the MDF_CKIx provider is
the sd-modulator - but idk if that's possible and cyclic dependencies
like that can always be dealt with anyway.

That's probably the most natural way to go about things from a DT point
of view, and makes some sense to me if the clock is being used to drive
communication with the sd-modulator - although it seems a little forced.
It's still better IMO than the MDF referencing itself as things are done
now.
