That's what an immutable branch means to everyone I've ever shared them
with in the past, but sure - it wouldn't change.  Anyhow, easier solution
below.

I've dropped the branch from IIO. That's fine because it was still being
tested and hasn't gone out as non-rebasing yet.

Next time I'll maybe find an IRC gateway and ping you on that.  I can't
find any reference to that being your preference in the kernel docs.
Given you have a helpful page on tip, might be worth adding a note.
I might of course be missing it.

If it goes into a reasonably early rc, I'll just merge the relevant rc
rather than needing an immutable. If next cycle, immutable please.

I started out a bit grumpy that I had to hold a non trivial series for
a cycle because of an x86 bug (having been very happy when David
fixed it incredibly quickly!), that got reviewed then disappeared
down a hole and didn't look like it would ever be seen again.
Meh, got me on a belligerent day.

Jonathan
