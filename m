Subject: [PATCH 04/15] perf debuginfo: Let the user skip and disable debuginfod fetches

From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

In the stdio case, while a fetch is in progress: 's' aborts it through
the debuginfod client's progress callback and remembers the build ID, so
that the rest of the session does not ask for it again; 'd' additionally
disables debuginfod for the session, emptying the DEBUGINFOD_URLS copy
perf owns (libdwfl's own client reads it in every query) and writing
core.debuginfod=false to the config file with
perf_config__set_variable().  SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM are
intercepted while the terminal is in raw mode and re-raised after it is
restored.

The keys are drained with read()s that do not block: the terminal is in
raw mode with VMIN and VTIME zero, so read() returns zero when nothing
was typed and the callback returns to the client, which carries on with
the fetch.  In the TUI nothing is shown yet, that comes in the next
patch.
