Right, makes sense.

Sounds good. I agree this should not have much of a performance
impact, and for the size it is probably as good as it gets without
a major rework of the lazy mm switch.

Yes, this would probably be opt-in by architecture, unless we decide
to give up on lazy mm switch altogether and pay the performance
penalty for that on CPUs without ASID support. Either way it is not
be something we can do right away but that we can still consider
in the future.

Would it be possible to move those checks into the individual
callers that want to avoid the WARN_ON(), with a comment on
each one explaining why they do that? It feels more consistent
to always warn here, and I would expect that for most of the
_nofault() users we do want the warning, and I'm still unsure
what is special about these.

Agreed. My main remaining concern is about the number of functions
that need the additional check, if we want to avoid missing
any of them. If we can have the check in access_ok(), that would
cover the majority of the functions you are changing right now,
and it looks like we can deal with the corner cases individually.

Since in principle every user access should go through both
access_ok/mask_user_address and current->mm check at some point,
so combining the two as much as possible should help long-term
maintainability.

Right, if dropping __copy_{from,to}_user() as global interfaces does
not help add the check in a consistent way, that can wait as well.
It looks like we are very slowly converting away from them already,
as we have about half the call sites left compared to v5.0.

There are probably few enough of these that we could address them
by either adding current->mm checks or converting them to use
the full versions instead where that is an obvious change like
that usb gadget driver.

Ok. Apparently there is some of this on arm64 as well, using
__uaccess_mask_ptr() instead of mask_user_address().

Arguably this is itself a TOCTOU issue and replacing
all __copy_{from,to}_user() with copy_{from,to}_user() would be a better
solution long-term, if we can do that.

These at least could be easily worked around by just skipping the
calls to copy_{from,to}_user_nofault() as mentioned above.
