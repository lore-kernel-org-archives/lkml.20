So there are two things, the status and the reference counters.

The runtime suspend of a parent/supplier is prevented by the latter,
not by the former, so if you never enable runtime PM for a device or
otherwise cause the runtime PM reference counters of the parent and
suppliers to get updated, it will never affect the parent or
suppliers.

However, if you enable runtime PM for a device, you runtime-resume it
and then you disable runtime PM, the reference counters will remain
unchanged.

Well, as I said above, runtime_status doesn't really matter if
disable_depth is nonzero.  Reference counters are a different matter,
which I guess is the source of confusion here.

But basically, nonzero disable_depth really only means that the
device's runtime PM callbacks cannot run and its status will not
change unless explicitly updated with
pm_runtime_set_active/suspended().

IMV, "enabled" and "disabled" are not really states, they just tell
you what can happen to the device and what can be done to it.

"Active" and "suspended" are (meta)states that tell you what has
happened to the device most recently.

They aren't completely orthogonal (or independent) because "disabled"
means that whatever has happened to the device recently is now sticky
until something is explicitly done to it.

Well, OK, but I've already covered this above.

Right.  More precisely, its references to the parent and suppliers
need to be dropped.

I would do that.

Well, actually enable() may need to be preceded with taking references
to the parent and suppliers.

I can totally agree that this whole thing is not easy to use.  I'm not
sure though if it might be made (much) easier to use TBH.
