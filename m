Subject: [PATCH v3 08/16] perf trace: Enumerate the target again once BPF is attached
From: Ian Rogers <irogers@google.com>
To: irogers@google.com, acme@kernel.org, namhyung@kernel.org
Cc: adrian.hunter@intel.com, james.clark@linaro.org, jolsa@kernel.org, 
	linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, linux-perf-users@vger.kernel.org, 
	mingo@redhat.com, peterz@infradead.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

evlist__create_maps() reads the target out of /proc, and the BPF
sched_process_fork() program only sees what is cloned once it is
attached. A task the target creates between the two is in neither, and
since cmd_trace() drops the sys_enter evsel in favour of
__augmented_syscalls__ there is no other source of enter events. Such a
task, and in turn everything it forks, goes unreported for the rest of
the session.

Read the target out of /proc once more, after the attach. Whatever
existed before the programs went live is there to be found, and whatever
is created after it is sched_process_fork()'s to add, so between them
nothing is left out. Doing this before the attach instead would only
move the window rather than close it.

The enumeration follows the same rule as the BPF programs, which is that
the maps name individual tasks:

 - -p names a process, so its thread group is read from
   /proc/<pid>/task.
 - -t names a thread, which is taken on its own. Expanding it to its
   thread group would trace the siblings it asked to leave out.
 - Descendants come from task->children, read through
   /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children. A forked task leads a thread group
   of its own, so each one found is walked in turn and a tree of any
   depth is covered. New threads are not listed there, copy_process()
   gives a CLONE_THREAD child the real_parent of its creator rather than
   the creator itself, but the thread group walk above has them.

The other two ways of choosing what to trace need nothing, for the same
reasons the window never affected them: 'perf trace -a' does not filter
on pid at all, and evlist__prepare_workload() keeps a workload blocked
on a pipe until evlist__start_workload(), well after the attach.

A target that exits during startup is not an error. Reading /proc for a
task that has gone fails with ENOENT, and a task directory that is read
but has nothing in it sets nothing at all, so errno is cleared before the
enumeration and only an allocation failure is passed back. Anything else
leaves the tasks that evlist__create_maps() already found in the map,
which sched_process_exit() takes out again as they die, and the session
runs on rather than being ended over a target that was going to stop
producing events anyway.

What is left is smaller and no longer lasts. A task found here may have
made syscalls between sys_enter going live and it being added to the
map, and those are not reported, but it is traced from that point on. On
a kernel built without CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN the children files are
absent and descendants cannot be named, leaving the threads of the
target, which are still picked up.

pid_t, PATH_MAX, FILE and the directory reading are all used directly by
the new code, so <sys/types.h>, <limits.h>, <stdio.h> and <dirent.h> are
included rather than relied upon to arrive through another header.
