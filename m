Sounds good.

That sounds fine, provided that hardware pushes a invalid BPT frame on
the link in the time window between the disarming and bank switch.
Otherwise the peripherals might receive garbage BTP data, no?

ok

but then if I follow your explanations above, if you stop the DMA first
don't you get a systematic xrun error before the bank switch happens?

The explanation make sense... but I am not fully clear on why you'd need
to protect the BPT state for link-based pm_runtime. Presumably a BPT
transfer would happen with a device reference held to prevent it from
suspending? Something's not right if you need to drain a BPT transfer in
a pm_runtime suspend, that suspend shouldn't happen in the first place...
