Sorry. Could you explain a little bit detail for this?.
AFAIU, this is to get the EK certificate from TPM non-volatile storage.
But, I don't know why *EK* certificate get would be relevant for
*mr selection*.  AFAIK, the TPM_Quote will be used AK not a EK.

Also, AFAIK, mr_selection is meaningful when the evidence_accept is
supported.

What is the relation-ship between mr-selecation and getting the TPM's
EK certificate getting from NV storage?
