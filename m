That's awesome. Please do take a look at the code and provide feedback and if
you don't mind, a tested-by tag would be awesome.

Yes seems interesting and I remember other folks (I think Rik) were interested
in these ideas as well.

I understand but I think for general solution we do need accounting for this and
I have rfc out for this.

Thanks a lot for this information, I will think more on these.
