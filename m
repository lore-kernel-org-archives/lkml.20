I think using existing stuff in sysfs is a good idea.
(Creating new things in sysfs fills me with dread!)

ARM/MPAM also has platform devices that can add the CLOSID/RMID metadata.
e.g. the GIC ITS [4] - a kind of translator for MSIs.

For these we considered just using the device name as found in /sys/bus/platform/devices/,
in the hope that can be tied back to a struct device - and we could add a callback for
resctrl to configure the device with a CLOSID/RMID.
(but - I've not seen a use-case for this yet - those devices generate very little traffic)


Robin M set me straight on the iommu_group:
Strictly that is the wrong abstraction as devices are in the same group if the
driver can't stop them communicating, e.g. PCIe peer2peer. This doesn't mean it
can't tell the traffic apart for CLOSID/RMID labelling.
I picked this because its the device granularity VFIO works with.

Equally, a device may create multiple streams of traffic, where only the driver
will know what each one corresponds to.


Using iommu_group like this may need a bit more thinking....
If we can fall back to using a device as seen by sysfs, then the arch differences
here could be invisible to user-space.

For ARM/MPAM - this would always be driver specific. The fields may be share a register
with other things the driver needs to consider.
The IOMMU abstracts this for its devices, but this is still something the IOMMU driver
needs to know about.

A driver hook, with a drivers/acpi fallback would be ideal.


Do you have arbitrary grouping of devices? e.g. a USB controller and the UART.
Or would the grouping make some sense to the OS. e.g. all the USB devices behind
this port.

Having the UART show up when you add a USB controller to a control group is a bit odd.

Arm's IOMMU does have controls/monitors that match the spec the MPAM driver needs,
but we currently have no way to expose them through resctrl.
The caches on the IOMMU are also relatively small - I've not yet seen anyone show that
setting the controls there makes a big difference.

Do you have I/O traffic that can turn up in the CPU L3 cache? I think PCIe calls
this 'cache stashing'.

Arm's IOMMU is the same - but the traffic may also show up in the L3 depending on how
the system is put together.

MPAM can have this happen - and today it will sanitise the values to the lowest
common value. Considerably lower becomes considerably upsetting!

I'd be interested if we have an approach for this - the IOMMU designers would argue
they only need one RMID per device - but the system wide sanitised value means they
have to match the rest of the system.


For MPAM systems this shape is a big headache because on the platforms we've seen,
the monitoring is done at the memory-controllers - so any RMID spaces get joined
up eventually.

What about using the device behind the IOMMU instead? Presumably the kernel
could allocate ids that don't clash with those in the IRDT, and use those
for the IOMMU.

I'd prefer we have one consistent way of doing this across architectures.
Especially if we're going to add something new to sysfs.


The sysfs path probably covers all bases - but I wouldn't want to parse that
in the kernel.

I had a half baked idea on how to do this. (which Ben has poked some holes in)

Assigning a device to a ctrl/mon group needs to be able to fail. We can use this
to re-allocate the RMID into the range the new device can use. The CPU tasks can
be repainted to use the new value - but the obvious problem is the old data in
the caches that uses the old RMID.
As no new traffic will be generated for that RMID, it might be possible to keep
it associated with the ctrl/mon group (which would now have two RMID) to keep the
user-space view of the counters correct until the old RMID falls below the
reallocation threshold, and it can be free'd.

It's worse if we ever needed/wanted to do this with CLOSID. Two CAT bitmaps
can be configured the same - but MBA doesn't alias in the same way. Tasks would
be able to burst higher than the configured limit - but the size is limited by
the size of the caches. And if no new traffic can be generated with the old
CLOSID/RMID, then the effect can't be made to last forever.


For a totally wild suggestion (that I don't think works here) - I had
mooted having a second mount of resctrl for islands of the SoC where the
properties are different. I don't think it works in this case as the IO-RMID
presumably gets seen by some other monitors later.
