Ok.  So if this was a common thing I'd suggest we might expose an extra
mask that presents what the various consumers have requested, but I'd
not go to that effort for the first driver that could use it.

Ah. Yes, with a copy already happening might as well make it just one.

Given these are fairly small, that might just be selection from a set
of options.

Ah. That would make life trickier.

This info is more than enough to convince me that it isn't worth
using the core demux stuff. Thanks for all the details!
