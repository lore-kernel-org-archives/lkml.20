Well, you are only on v4.  ;-)

Adding a new function without uses is frowned upon.  After all, if it
wasn't frowned upon, there would be tons of unused code in the kernel.

But you are in luck.  John Paul Adrian Glaubitz noticed the sh patch
despite not being CCed and acked it.  And I happen to be the one who
committed the original lib/cmpxchg-emu.c commit.  Plus at least one of
the architecture-specific patches.  (Ah, yes, the problem was that RCU
had been using single-byte cmpxchg(), thus breaking the architectures
not supporting this, so I provided cmpxchg_emu_u8() as the fix.)

So what I have done is to queue the lib patch, but without the
arch/*/Kconfig pieces, and adding the CCs shown above.  I have also
queued the sh patch, with added CCs and with arch/sh/Kconfig.  The point
of moving the arch/*/Kconfig changes each to its respective patch is to
put all the arch-specific changes into the corresponding patch.

I will of course check with John Paul Adrian Glaubitz to make sure that
he is OK with relocating the arch/sh/Kconfig change to the patch that
he already acked, and I will of course adjust as needed if he isn't.

That means you only need to re-send the ARC, csky, and xtensa patches,
with CCs added as shown above.  No guarantees, but hopefully quite a
bit fewer than 100 times.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
