And I'm not telling to go there in every driver you touched!

Scope is a fundamental thing in C programming language, I believe with OOP
staying with us for already somewhat 40 years we should have learnt that
scope may be associated with the local references be dropped.

Yes, but doing only one thing at a time has its own downsides as well.
As long as it makes the same or similar churn in the future while being
tighten (I mean touching runtime PM calls but not converting in some
cases to cleanup versions) it makes a lot of sense to me to kill two birds
with one stone.

And I definitely disagree on the inducing a potential unneeded churn
in the future.

But as I said... ^^^
