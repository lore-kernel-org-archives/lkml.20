You mean a "fallthrough" for MAM while making SAM path an iterator?
I was thinking in something easier to start with like simply not
supporting SAM path in this RFW_ATOMIC_CHUNKED flag suggestion, and
return an error like we do today if you send a non atomic conformat io
with RWF_ATOMIC.

The "interesting" thing is (for NVMe MAM) that you can send a large
command and it will be atomic at the chunk boundary anyways. But I guess
users may want to have guarantees of their chunk atomic granularity.

Thanks for the suggestion. I plan to work on it after this series.

HW is available for those who need it. FYI, I'm currently testing this
on a real device and post more details in a new revision.

100%.

Thanks Arthur for the review. I talked with Keith at LPC about this so
I was planning to resend it. I will now, take your suggestions and send a
new version.
