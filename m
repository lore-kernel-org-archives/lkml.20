OK, thanks for that explanation.

I think summing that up in a comment and definitely the commit message would be
useful.

Also potentially gathering all this kind of state and putting it in mm.h or
mm_types.h would be nice too.

I say this elsewhere but I do think userfaultfd_k.h is a bit of a confused
mess and we shouldn't make things more confusing by wanting to keep state
explicitly there.

Right, I do think in general if experienced(-ish ;) kernel maintainers find
things confusing, this is _usually_ a signal that things could be made more
clear in the series.

Of course not excluding the possibility that I am simply not bright enough
to figure it out :)

I think you're missing the point, but I go into detail with examples in 6/6
that hopefully clarifies things.

The enum/bit number/keeping equality stuff was just me thinking out loud,
the point here is about abstraction and keeping things clear.

I mean, and give me some rope, by your argument, why have
vma_is_anonymous()? Just check for !vma->vm_ops everywhere right?

Well I'd argue that it is _far_ clearer, self-documents, abstracts the
_means_ by which a VMA is anonymous (no vm_ops) from the semantics of 'is
this VMA anonymous'.

Equally so here.

I actually think it'd not be unreasonable, given how few flags there are to
have e.g.:

	vma_handles_uffd_missing()
	vma_handles_uffd_minor()
	vma_handles_uffd_wp()
	vma_handles_uffd_rwp()

Or something like this?

And, as I say in 6/6, you are checking vma_test(vma, VMA_UFFD_BIT) each
time (or perhaps context != NULL? Not sure if equivalent) now you can
abstract that and remove duplication.

And _then_ the weird 'WP but not uffd' case can be self-documented and
called out like:

	vma_was_uffd_wp()

Or whatever naming would make sense.

Hopefully that clarifies my point.

I'm talking about the 'mode' naming, which I think we have reached
agreement upon in 6/6.

unsigned long :) but I think unsigned int is fine.

Or we could just move flags out of that horrible header :)

I hate how C headers can force us into difficult decisions that make life
harder...
