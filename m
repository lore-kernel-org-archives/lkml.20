Thank you for clarifying this.  So I understand it is an issue from a real
world workload.  I'm still curious how sparse the real access pattern in the
real world workload is, and if there is a low haning fruit.  There might be
rooms to improve in their DAMON usage.

Could you share more details about the real world setup and findings?  More
specifically, how they define the hot proportion and how they collect the
number?  What is DAMON setup?  What are the real numbers they saw?

Also, I understand they want to understand real working set size of guests.
Could you further share what they are planning to do with the monitored working
set size?  The required level of accuracy of the monitoring could depend on the
purpose.

Thank you for clarifying this.  Now I understand why they use THP, and I fully
agree they should keep using THP.

Thanks to your detailed and nice explanation, I don't doubt about the needs to
use huge pages.  So I wouldn't insist on Oracle/VM benefit from huge pages.

I'm still curious the real access distribution, though.  I understand you don't
have the data yet.  It would be very helpful if you could share that in future.

Thank you for clarifying.  Yes, if you really need sub-pmd access, I believe
the perf event based DAMON could be more useful.  Nonetheless, as I requested
above, knowing the DAMON usage and purpose in more detail might let us finding
a low hanging fruit.

That makes sense.  Because Ravi thankfully already implemented this nice
working version prototype, there is no reason to not test it right now.

Yes, it is now clear to me.  Thank you for patiently englightening me, Lian.

I believe testing the perf event based monitoring with Ravi's implementation is
a good path forward.

I'm curious about the real setup and results your clients got from their real
world wokload.  But that's not necessarily a blocker of the perf event based
monitoring test.


Thanks,
SJ
