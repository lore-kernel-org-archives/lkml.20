Hi Eric,

It is not black and white, and I am working on some optimizations.
Today, with one key, one A72 core with the Crypto Extensions is about
2x better than the SEC, at every buffer size. However, that core is
then at its limit: 6 to 9 Gbps of AES-128-GCM, fully busy.

With many keys and many buffers in flight, it changes. With 16 KiB
buffers, 16 keys and some WIP fixes (MC firmware configuration mosty, maybe
few kernel fixes), one A72 core feeding the SEC reaches 47.1 Gbps, while
the same core does 9.3 Gbps with the Crypto Extensions. At 4 KiB it is
14.4 against 8.5 Gbps. At low network packet size (WIP about 1400 octet) the
A72 wins.

For single flows, the SEC should not be used: with the current kernel code,
one key cannot go past about 4 Gbps.

So, even if it is tempting to drop caamalg_qi2.c, I believe some users
still have a use for it. Note: I only focused on AES-128-GCM.

Agreed. CONFIG_CRYPTO_SELFTESTS caught it on the first boot.

I cannot argue with that, but I would rather not be the one who drops
them from caamalg_qi2.c.

Definitely, the device tree is not the right place, I get the point.
v2 will move away from it.

My first goal is to get these features working again on the
LX2160A, and to be able to select the crypto backend.

Best regards,
