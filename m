SMI and RSM, yeah I think so. kvm_smm_changed() ->
kvm_mmu_reset_context() deletes all roots, and kvm_mmu_load() will flush
the current ASID when a new root is loaded.

MTRR writes seem to do nothing beyond store the value, probably since
0a7b73559b39 ("KVM: x86: Remove VMX support for virtualizing guest MTRR
memtypes"). It is documented as an errata but I maybe KVM should still
flush the TLB? If that's a real bug, it's separate from this series tho.
We just need to make sure if we fix it, we should flush both ASIDs. We
can probably just reset the MMU context here too?

I can't find anything related to IORR in KVM.

For MSRs, I think the relevant ones are EFER and PAT:

- For EFER, a change to KVM_MMU_EFER_ROLE_BITS resets the MMU similar to
  SMI/RSM, so covers both ASIDs. Clearing EFER.SVME frees L2's ASID and
  re-allocating an ASID will flush it by clearing last_asid.

- For PAT, I am not sure if that falls under "system MSRs that affect
  address translation", but KVM isn't flushing for L1 today on PAT
  writes anyway, so I hope not?

I am honestly not sure. It seems like we should be flushing the context
that issued the PV flush. But I also suppose (aside from Hyper-V) all L2
PV calls should go to L1, not L0, so should we always flush L1's context
here?

It would be a pre-existing bug, but this series would be adding it to
SVM as well. Adding David here since his name appears all over the git
log for that code, so hopefully he'll tell us for sure.

Will fix.

Thanks!
