(Note that CONFIG_PER_VMA_LOCK is going away and defaulting on)

No sorry, you're incorrect.

So actually you're increasing by a cacheline and increasing the VMA size by
64 bytes, i.e. 1/3, which is unacceptable obviously.

Maybe there's something that can be done with:

		/* forced alignments: 1 */

Perhaps? But that looks potentially ugly.

Thanks.

I feel this series is not really clarifying things very well at this point,
it's all still very confusing.

It feels more like taking the existing UFFD approach and just putting a
'store the same state elsewhere' overlay on top, which isn't really helping
anything.

I am left a. confused about how all these flags interact (which suggests
the bad design is still in place) and b. wondering what the benefits are.

Which indicates that the design could be much improved and clarified here.

There's no hole there see above. I'm not sure if rearranging can fix it?
Maybe there is some other way.

Yup one of the inconsistently named checks, userfaultfd_protected().

This was from before but really the majority of vma checks are vma_xxx() so
let's actually clean this up and call it vma_is_uffd_protected() or
something like this, please.

I think this naming inconsistency is really horrible and confusing, that
has to change. 'uffd' everywhere please.

Yeah I assumed as much.

I wonder if we can grab the lower bits in the context pointer for this

I think really the point is that it's not clear what each of these distinct
flags are for, I guess I'm repeating myself on that :)

I think the constructive way forward is to make it super clear, whether
through types, commit msg, comments etc.

I mean or we could just put the damn stuff in mm_types.h :) I really hate
usserfaultfd_k.h as a header honestly. It makes little sense.

OK but now that means there's a subtle hidden dependency there that is
really easy to break in future.

(I assume this is true of every other case where I've flagged this, I guess
I could ask AI to check :)

In any case using bit 12 eliminates all this so moot.

Yeah I agree that it's an unfortunate aspect of the VMA flags design,
unfortunately it's kind of inherent - to have a bitmap VMA flags type you
have to define by bit and lose the VM_NONE stuff, and this solution is
really a bit of a hack.

Really the problem only emerges in practice in two cases:

1. A 64-bit value in a 32-bit kernel (not the case here)
2. An if-deffed bit value (the issue here0

Case 2 is pretty rare, so (and I think you agreed elsewhere) avoiding this
is the right solution.

I am thinking of solving case 1 by just switching 32-bit kernels to a
64-bit vma_flags_t :) but still mulling that one!

Moving forwards I think avoiding the pattern is probably the better way,
rather determining whether or not a feature is a thing based on whether a
VMA flag bit is set

Yup but the pattern repeats all over the place and in each case you're
checking _both_ VMA_UFFD_BIT _and_ a uffd mode.

So that's open-coded and duplicated, it'd therefore be nice to separate it
out.

E.g.:

	static inline bool vma_test_uffd_flags(const struct vm_area_struct *vma,
			unsigned int uffd_flags)
	{
		return vma_test(vma, VMA_UFFD_BIT) &&
			(vma_uffd_flags(vma) & uffd_flags);
	}

Then this kind of pattern simply becomes:

	return vma_test_uffd_flags(vma, UFFD_FLAG_RWP);

Nicer right?

[If I didn't say elsewhere also it'd be nice to rename uffd_mode() to
vma_uffd_flags() or something so the vma_xxx() pattern is kept consistent.]

Because you are testing for something very distinct from every other
instance where you are checking for a 'mode'.

In every other case it's 'is this flag set'. In this case it's 'is this
flag distinctly set'.

Renaming this from mode to flags obviously helps make things clearer.

But given there's a comment there and you're renaming mode -> flags anyway
that should be fine.

In every other instance of referencing the flag you are using VMA_UFFD_BIT,
here you are arbitrarily using the VMA_UFFD value.

Given we agreed on bit 12 anyway, let's drop VMA_UFFD altogether and use:

	vma_flags_set(&new_vma_flags, VMA_UFFD_BIT);

Here please!

Oh something I didn't notice before also:

	uffd_mode(cur) & (UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP) & ~mode

Is pretty ambiguous no? Is ~mode applied to the result of (uffd_mode(cur) &
(UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP)) or just to (UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP)?

Probably should be e.g.:

	((uffd_mode(cur) & (UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP)) & ~mode)

Or:

	uffd_mode(cur) & ((UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP) & ~mode)

I guess it ultimately doesn't matter either way since you're checking for
either flag being set but then that leads on to how confusing this pattern
is:

You're checking for either flag only if those flags were not set in mode?

So in English, it's 'check to see if UFFD_MODE_WP or UFFD_MODE_RWP are
set if and only if those modes were not already set in mode'.

So you have to decode this to 'are the WP flags dropped?'

So I'm sorry that is pretty confusing I would say, especially kept all in
one line!

(I personally confused myself by looking at this, not sure what kind of
barometer that is :)

I disagree that we can't improve it, something like:

	static inline bool vma_is_uffd_ctx(const struct vm_area_struct *vma,
			const struct userfaultfd_ctx *ctx)
	{
		return vma->vm_uffd_state.ctx == ctx;
	}

	...

	const unsigned int old_wp_flags =
		uffd_mode(cur) & (UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP);
	const unsigned int new_wp_flags =
		mode & (UFFD_MODE_WP | UFFD_MODE_RWP);
	const bool drops_wp_flags = old_wp_flags & ~new_wp_flags;

	...

	if (vma_is_uffd_ctx(cur, ctx) && drops_wp_flags)
		goto out_unlock;

Would be clearer I think right?

Yeah it's odd that, but the bits themselves being #ifdef'd is itself a

Right, I think we keep coming around to this as being unclear.

I think having those flags that must be distinct define in mm_types.h or
mm.h together with some explanation would resolve this, rather than
slinging state around in different files just for the sake of maintaining
userfaultfd_k.h as a thing.
