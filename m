I was using the madvise option as an example of a user-controllable hint,
I'm not suggesting you use it directly as-is.

But the driver doesn't have this information.

My understanding of 18049c8cff9c is that it's not about allocation
failures, so this doesn't work.

Well I don't think it belongs in the kernel either. I suppose you could
make it a driver module option but it's ugly as hell. We really need
Yabin's input here, I think.
