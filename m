Fair point. I mistakenly assumed that the content of the message and the
RFC being framed as a "proof of concept" would have made it clear that I
was just asking for a high-level opinion.

During the discussion with Yilun, we also touched on other important
topics, like how to safely pair the DT "descriptions" with the
images/bitstreams to avoid TOCTOU races.

My intent was to collect some constructive feedback on these topics and
extend the discussion to other developers and maintainers before investing
further effort into this.

I spent a considerable amount of time reading related discussions
on the mailing list, before and after sending the RFC, as it can be
seen in the discussion.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/97739313-fc97-4b11-b2e2-d680621a7fe1@linux.dev/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fpga/db7cfe9e-b2ba-4323-bff9-44598e1f70bb@linux.dev/

The historical pushback against userspace overlay interfaces motivated
by security, resource management, and kernel stability concerns
is exactly what led me to experiment with the statically pre-validated
region "variants" in the first place.

The FPGA "variants" proposed in this RFC are essentially statically-defined
whitelisted nodes.

I see that "DT addon" mentioned by Krzysztof is the preferred solution,
but I still think a static approach is preferable for FPGA since the set
of bitstreams for an FPGA region is finite and statically defined at
design time. I think there is a fundamental asymmetry between the
marginal convenience of not having to rebuild the base DTB and the
burden of securing a DTO interface.

I completely understand. However, the general idea behind variant regions
was to introduce a common way to handle partial reconfiguration from
userspace. In the proof-of-concept RFC, I extended of-fpga-region to
implement variants in a statically-defined way because it was a relevant
case, but the mechanism was designed to be eventually implemented also for
other FPGA regions.
