I agree the doc is prescribing what to do when an iterator is added, not
that every case must have one. But my point is that having both
iterators coexist is the convention, not overkill.

Page owner traversal looks like iterating over PFNs, but PFN is just a
number; what is actually being traversed is page_owner records, buddy
blocks, online/ offline sections, memblock holes—kernel state that a
prog cannot see on its own. So it is not a pure numeric-range walk.

I agree the range can be obtained. But being able to obtain a range is
not the same as that range being meaningful to the user. Page owner
users typically care about a process, a cgroup's leaks, or the global
distribution; PFN is just a physical address index, and users almost
never know in advance which zone or which PFN range to scan. Letting the
prog specify a PFN range raises the bar for writing it while the
practical use cases remain limited. This is not a feasibility issue—it
is a question of abstraction level.

I agree on eligibility. But I'd like to expand on "only faster": what
those steps change is the scale of the walk, and under SPARSEMEM that
scale is structural, not a constant factor. On a 256G, 8-NUMA machine I
have, node0 is:

crash> struct pglist_data ffff0106ffffe580 | grep node_spanned_pages
   node_spanned_pages = 17235968,
crash> struct pglist_data ffff0106ffffe580 | grep node_present_pages
   node_present_pages = 523024,

For this one node alone, about 97% of spanned is holes. With
bpf_for(pfn, start, end) plus a bpf_page_owner_read() per iteration,
that is at least 16,712,944 kfunc calls, and bpf_for has no scheduling
point inside, and all of them are wasted work. The gap grows with memory
size, and I'm concerned "only faster" understates the runtime cost on
real machines.

One more structural issue: bpf_for is capped at BPF_MAX_LOOPS = 8 * 1024
* 1024, and this is a runtime check—the verifier will not reject it up
front. The spanned of this node is already 17.23M, so a single bpf_for
cannot cover it; you have to split it into N chunks and poll, with the
chunking state kept in a prog map, i.e. a loop nested in a loop.

And cur/end are stored as BPF_W (32-bit), while the PFN upper bound
tracks the physical address width: on x86-64 with 46-bit PA, max_pfn can
reach 2^34, and 2^40 with LA57; on arm64, 2^36 for 48-bit PA and 2^40
for 52-bit PA. A 32-bit PFN range will overflow here.

Solving all of this requires yet another, more complex kfunc—and it
looks increasingly like bpf iter. So why not just use the iter?

I have no doubt about feasibility.

Similarly, I have no doubt about feasibility. I do have some concerns
about data consistency and performance. It also increases prog
complexity.

In summary, while I don't dispute the feasibility of the bpf_for +
bpf_page_owner_read approach and fully agree that kernel-side simplicity
is paramount, I wonder if we should also weigh the complexity on the
program side. If using this kfunc imposes a steep learning curve, I'm
concerned it might limit adoption. If a feature lacks practical utility,
it becomes difficult to justify the effort.

Thanks for the detailed explanations and for walking me through
these points.



Thanks,
Zhen
