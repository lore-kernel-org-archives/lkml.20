The missing ACPI handle is not a hard part IMV, it is a matter of
modifying struct acpi_dep_data to be able to hold struct acpi_device
pointers instead of ACPI handles in case the devices in question have
no ACPI handles and adjusting the code using it.

Finding the dependencies is harder.  I guess it may involve walking
the namespace and looking up a device object with a specific device ID
or similar.

Note that the dependencies can be added to acpi_dep_list after
creating a struct acpi_device with acpi_add_single_object() and
acpi_scan_add_dep() is not really suitable for that, but it should be
doable if the dependencies can be found.

Well, it is not really straightforward.

I'm still not sure why you can't represent all devices in the ACPI
namespace in addition to describing some of them in static tables.  I
guess that would work for everybody, wouldn't it?
