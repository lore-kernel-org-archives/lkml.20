Exactly for that reason on s390 we do topology updates after
capacity updates. Topology changes caused by the underlying hypervisor
or the cpu capacity changes can get reflected without a problem via
topology rebuilds. Without topology rebuild we wouldn't even get
the correct SD_ flags to trigger asym_capacity behavior like you say.

I agree, but Shrikanth's solution can not bring some of the
behavior changes required. cpu_preferred_mask can help
direct task placement away from low capacity cores but idle
core first approach still places tasks to fully idle low
capacity cores. This patches proposal tries to move tasks
first to the idle SMT siblings.

Consider the following;
On a system with 2 high capacity and 4 low capacity cpus.
steal governor of vCPU backoff mechanism calculates 2 low capacity
cpus should be taken off from the cpu_preferred_mask to decrease
experienced steal time. cpu_preferred_mask has 2 high capacity
and 2 low capacity cpus.

Current behavior tires to place tasks to fully idle cores first
even if they are low capacity cores.

       c0(high) c1(high)  c2(low)  c3(low)  ...
-------------------------------------------
SMT 0 task     task      task     task
SMT 1


With the proposal, the fully idle core preference is circumvented
and the most fitting SMT thread is selected.

       c0(high) c1(high)  c2(low)  c3(low)  ...
-------------------------------------------
SMT 0 task     task
SMT 1 task     task

This is beneficial because at the time of contention(system pressure)
low capacity cores could perform worse than SMT siblings of busy
high capacity cores, even if there is not enough steal time for
steal governor of Shrikanth's vCPU backoff to mark said low
capacity cores as non-preferred.

Andrea came up with an idea to extend Shrikanth's mechanism further
by adding a soft affinity to a selected set of CPUs. Task placement
would first fully load these CPUs before spilling load onto rest
of the CPUs on cpu_preferred_mask. That would help achieve the
behavior I describe above if the soft affinity covers high
capacity CPUs.

The discussion is still on going though. If Shrikanth thinks this is
a worthwhile concept then I'd be glad to work on the implementation
and provide the patches.
