The xswap is to be used with the swap.tiers. So at the swap.tiers it
selects xswap or SSD swap. Will that solve your problem?

It is cleaner because it avoids the dual personality issue. It also
paves the way to enable writingback from one swap tier to another.
That is heading to the right directions.  The vswap writeback only
serves zswap, not others.

The biggest hurdle is the user API. One of Johannes's biggest
objections is that it lacks writeback support and perhaps more. Now
the writeback RFC is available. Let's re-evaluate what is possible.
The swap.tier series has been out for a year now.

In the worst case,, we can have swap.tiers using zswap.writeback to
simulate the current zswap behavior. I think that should be possible.

If it is the same but does not have the 33 swap_is_vswap() fragmented
dual personality issue, I see that is a reason to choose that path
instead. What do you say?

We don't have to go throgh the universal interface to resolve the 33
swap_is_vswap(). It seems there is an alternative now. We can take the
xswap route to eventually solve all your problems.

Please correct me if I am wrong; here is my understanding from you:

vswap is off by default because of that knob. You turn it on and it
starts zswap.
Two questions here:
1) Is your knob compatible with the existing /etc/fstab where people
use it to enable swap devices, including with UUIDs, etc.?
2) When you enable the knob, do some unit test and disable the knob
again. Does the vswap go through the same path as swap off so no usage
of vswap exists on the system?

That is the existing use case I have in mind.

Code maintainability is also a consideration when choosing which
technical solutions to move forward with, when there are alternatives
to provide solutions to the same problem.
