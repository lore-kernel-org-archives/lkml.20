Subject: [PATCH 06/12] perf symbol: Fall back to fetching the vmlinux by build ID

From: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

A profile recorded on a kernel that is no longer installed, be it
because the machine was rebooted into a new kernel or because the
profile is being processed on another machine, can't have its kernel
symbols resolved: /proc/kallsyms matches the running kernel, not the
one in the profile, and is refused when restricted, e.g. with
kernel.perf_event_paranoid > 1, while the build-id cache may carry
just a kallsyms copy with zeroed addresses.  With no kernel symbols
the kernel samples can't be annotated, so they all end up in the
'(unknown)' data type and the kernel is missing from the data type
profile JSON "dsos" entry.

As a last resort, when the kernel symbols can't be found locally and
the user didn't specify a kallsyms file, fetch the vmlinux keyed by
the kernel build ID recorded in the perf.data file using the
debuginfod client and use it for symbols, which also provides the
DWARF debuginfo needed for data type profiling.

The fetch is made with dso->lock dropped, the same way dso__debuginfo()
does it for the debuginfo of a DSO, and the fetched file is loaded with
the lock held again, only if another thread didn't get the symbols in
the meantime, checked with dso__has_symbols(): dso__loaded() is set by
dso__load() even for an attempt that failed, and would make a successful
fetch throw the file away.

Like the other vmlinux sources this honors --ignore-vmlinux and
--ignore-vmlinux_buildid: a fetched vmlinux is still a vmlinux, and
the fetch is keyed by the build ID, so both flags skip it.  'perf
record' sets ignore_vmlinux_buildid internally, and so does 'perf
probe' for the commands other than --list, --del and --add when given
an offline vmlinux, keeping those away from the fetch as well.  A
'perf probe' that doesn't set it, e.g. --funcs or --add without
--vmlinux on a system with a restricted /proc/kallsyms, can have the
kernel debuginfo fetched, like the other tools.  The fetch itself
follows the opt-out controls added in the previous patch,
--no-debuginfod, core.debuginfod=false and the build-id-cache-is-off
case, and can be skipped with the 's'/'d' keys while it runs.  Build
IDs that were a miss are remembered, not queried again on every
dso__load() retry.

With a profile recorded on a system running kernel 7.1.10, later
processed after it was upgraded to 7.1.13, 'perf report -s type
' went from having all 24.91% of the kernel samples as
'(unknown)' data types to resolving struct task_struct, struct rq,
struct tty_struct, struct qspinlock, etc, with the kernel DSO, keyed
by its build ID, appearing in the data type profile JSON.
