Unless we really need it, let's stay with "long" for now. As you mentioned below
this is busy/hot path, no need to add overhead of atomic here.

So, one motivation is cleaner code?

I think you are going and looking too much into the history of this warning. I
think you just need to explain that the current warning in the update side
already can't always catch the actual leak and is costly. Moving to read side
make the code cleaner and warnings will be at the location where the consumers
we care about are going to consume it. Also add couple of sentences on behavior
difference it will have i.e. warning on flipping into negative vs we will
continue to operate even in negative but only warn on negative consumption.

Another question: why is this patch part of this series? Just some orthogonal
cleanups or are they related?
