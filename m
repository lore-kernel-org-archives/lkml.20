Following up on the padding cost, since I said I would find out where it
goes.

It is tailroom, not cloning. Over 70000 padded frames, none were cloned:
frames average 1575 bytes and need about 471 bytes of padding, but arrive
with about 106 bytes of tailroom, so __skb_pad() reallocates on 98% of
them. mac80211 reserves IEEE80211_ENCRYPT_TAILROOM, 18 bytes, and offers
no way for a driver to ask for more on TX; extra_tx_headroom is headroom
and extra_beacon_tailroom is beacons only.

So I tried the other way round, a preallocated per-device buffer: copy
the frame plus the zeros into it and transfer from there, which avoids
the allocation. Interleaved A/B, 20 second uplink runs:

  mode         throughput   CPU (4 cores)   __skb_pad
  __skb_pad    18.6, 18.3      14.3, 15.0    444, 449 ms
  bounce       19.0, 19.8      13.8, 14.3        0 ms

That recovers most of it, roughly 2% of one core and 3 to 5% of
throughput.

I am not proposing it for this series. It is a workaround for the
missing tailroom knob, it costs a copy, and it is only clean where a
lock already serialises the transfer, which is true for this chip but
not for the generic path. If you would rather have it as a separate
patch later, or think the tailroom knob is worth raising with Johannes,
I am happy either way.

Best regards,
Luka Gejak
