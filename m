Sorry for the misunderstanding, Yes there is no such a fallback in 
existing bindings.

Our intention was to use new proposed generic fallback compatible string 
that will support USB dwc3 flatted node for all Samsung soc when those 
are migrated in the future without adding SoC specific compatible string 
in driver.

Agreed, Here using generic fallback name (samsung,snps-dwc3 as a 
reference of qcom,snps-dwc3) is incorrect as snps is vendor not a device.

As per DTS101 slide , Now we clear that the future Exynos SoCs could 
use  samsung,exynos8855-dwc3 as a fallback when they are compatible with 
the Exynos8855 hardware definition, rather than introducing a generic 
samsung,snps-dwc3 fallback. The dedicated compatible would still 
describe any SoC specific differences, such as clocks.

And Understood that we were mixing the current Exynos8855 binding with 
the longer term migration plan for the existing Exynos SoCs and future 
SoCs.

We will drop the generic fallback and use SoC specific compatible 
samsung,exynos8855-dwc3 (vendor,device), following 
samsung,exynos-dwc3.yaml as the reference.

Regarding the binding filename, if the flattened representation is 
expected to support multiple Exynos SoCs where there is only differences 
in clock in the future, similar to how samsung,exynos-dwc3.yaml covers 
multiple SoCs with the legacy (parent and child) node representation, 
should we use a common binding filename for the flattened representation 
instead of a SoC specific name like samsung,exynos8855-dwc3.yaml.
For example,
     samsung,exynos-dwc3-flattened.yaml.

The intention was to avoid adding separate compatible entries to 
dwc3_generic_of_match[] for each Exynos SoC.

We understand that adding SoC specific compatibles is the correct 
approach, as follow in samsung,exynos-dwc3.yaml.

Thanks for pointing out the DTS101 slids, and we referred again the 
binding documentation including DTS101 slids for further clarification 
on the using of fallback.

Agreed and As we mentioned in above comment, we will use the existing 
samsung,exynos-dwc3.yaml as the reference for the Samsung binding and 
drop the qcom,snps-dwc3 reference.

Understood. As mentioned above, we are mixing the current Exynos8855 
binding with the longer term migration plan and will keep this binding 
focused on Exynos8855 only and handle other SoCs when they are actually 
migrated.

Thanks,
