you really should have sent this as an RFC or a discussion.

You say your change "can do VMA splits on exec mm teardown" - that sounds
very much like the root of the problem :)

This makes absolutely no sense, we are not allocating maple nodes then
immediately freeing them while also retaining them in the same iterator.

The mmap write lock serialises writes to the maple tree also so only the
current task can do this except... if the kernel is patched :)

If it's a store that invalidates the node, then that same operation also
moves the same iterator forawrd.

But... what exactly caused the node to be deleted and the iterator to
somehow remain valid?

What you're describing simply isn't possible.

The mm maple tree is locked under MT_FLAGS_LOCK_EXTERN |
MT_FLAGS_USE_RCU. We use the VMA/mmap locks to serialise.

The mmap write lock serialises the only possible writer to the current
task.

If there was some way of doing this we 100% would have hit this
before. Hell, syzkaller and friends have hit the most outlandish stuff
imaginable.

In the patch you describe the only stores are being done by the called
__split_vma() calls which... use the same iterator?

As you can see from the sig:

static __must_check int
__split_vma(struct vma_iterator *vmi, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
	    unsigned long addr, int new_below)

So I think what's happening is that your patch that "can do VMA splits on
exec mm teardown" is doing something wrong here.

This makes no sense, except... if something wrongly starts writing into
mm_mt without proper locking, like... a custom patch in the kernel :)

Yes because the bug almost certainly doesn't exist in mainline :)

I'm not sure that's a contract that exists? RCU lock or external lock
yes...

Yup, it shows. I think this isn't a great showcase for gpt...

I have to say this isn't the way to engage on this stuff Andi - you're
essentially workslopping us when you really you should have _opened_ with a
discussion and copied the actual patch you've made to the kernel.

> Signed-off-by: Andi Kleen <ak@kernel.org>

This patch is wrong even if your theory is right, and the patch is utterly
horrible from a maintenance point of view anyway.

The changes are very horrible, even if we did need to do something like this, it
really couldn't be in this form.

This introduces assumptions about not sleeping all over, it breaks the
abstraction, I mean it's pretty patently obviously not upstreamable.

But you also do weird stuff like... assuming an rcu_read_lock() after a
sleep somehow restores the node back from death...

This could all have been cleared up and saved people time had you just
kicked off a discussion thread or pinged us.

If your RCU theory were true, then the iterator now has invalid nodes in it
then when next you RCU lock -> walk you are going to UAF?

You're also forcing a complete rewalk every single time and making the vmi
pointless here.

This makes no sense, your theory is that an RCU grace period can invalidate
any node right, somehow?

Now nested rcu locks, to add to complexity...

I mean I could go on but I think the LLM has got itself very confused here
and a human should have intervened sooner.
