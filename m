Ah OK, good to hear. For once, it sounded like that's not the case. My bad.

But if Linux doesn't control, some other entity would vote and until then
the system shouldn't enter that state. Without knowing that it is system
state, will the kernel be unable to choose that state as it hidden vote
is invisible/not tracked ? I trying to understand why if Linux chooses
that system level state as part of idle loop, the platform can't downgrade
if all the voting requirements are not met. I am struggling with that
and want to make sure we are not working around a broken firmware.

Sorry for being pedantic, but some real example would help to understand
it IMO.

I understand that part. SYSTEM_SUSPEND is sort of platform co-ordinated
once the requirement for entering is met.

I need to check if we use ACPI S-states via S2Idle which is the case with
this patch set I assume.
