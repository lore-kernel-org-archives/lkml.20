All paths that check EFER.LMA/EFER.LME only, right?

Don't get me wrong, it's still a lot, but I was hoping it's something
a couple of helpers can help with. Looking at the code, maybe not so
easy because it's not just vcpu->arch.efer.

> We could forcefully sanitize EFER in flows that write EFER,

Hmm that's exactly what we're doing here, except that we sanitize when
creating the vmcb02 and reject in KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE.

Either way it's a game of whack-a-mole, unfortunately, whether it's on
the write side or the read side. What I am hoping is that if we do
miss one case, we don't crash or corrupt the VM. Ideally, we can just
ignore EFER.LMA if EFER.LME is not set in these cases?

Well, "always" except for this one case :P
