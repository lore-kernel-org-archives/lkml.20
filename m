Yes, but (usually) not breaking existing users of real software is
more important than not breaking compliance with an abstract spec.
Especially when the spec was written from the software, not the other
way around.

If structured tags are allowed before the root node.  There might be a
case for that (and maybe you've already made it in the addon series),
but so far it's not obvious to me that's useful.

empty name checks something, but the BEGIN_NODE test is meaningless if
we're found our offset by searching for a BEGIN_NODE tag.

Usually I'd agree (DRY principle).  But as I say, the purpose of this
test is a special case - it's trying to test things piece by piece
with a minimum of circular dependencies.  That tends to make it
clearer what's gone wrong when somethin gbreaks.

One test that's safe on any tree just checking the empty name, another
that's checking the low-level construction with a known offset.
That's a good idea.

Encoding that know offset in a property is overcomplicating things
though, and it makes this very low-level test rely on parsing a
property, which we want to do even less that searching for the root
offset.  But that's ok - we're only calling it on specifically
constructed trees, so we can pass in the expected offset as an another
parameter.

No, it's good.  I'm less concerned about over-engineering in the
tests since, in a way, they test themselves.
