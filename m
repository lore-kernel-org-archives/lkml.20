Is there really a point in enabling the clock on-demand? Why not keep it en=
abled
always? It makes the driver more complex and I don't see a real benefit.

Ok. Then I guess keep the current check.

Ok.

Yeah, I forgot that the devm action would cause a clk_disable_unprepare() t=
o be
called on unprobe, which wouldn't work here. So ignore that.

As for the clock running for as long as the driver is bound, I don't think
that's much of a problem.

Great.
