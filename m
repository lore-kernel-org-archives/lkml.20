Understood -- the '\n' is not something I'm attached to.

The issue I was trying to point out is really the truncation of
unterminated writes, not that '\n' itself should be treated specially.
If supporting only the documented NUL-terminated form keeps the parser
simpler, I'm fine with that as well.

Thanks again for all the reviews. They made this test much better than
what I started with.

Thanks,
Tao
