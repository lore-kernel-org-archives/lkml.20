I was trying to say this by "gated by TD ATTRIBUTES/XFAM", I will describe it
more clearly.

I also struggled with naming this macro and couldn't come up with a better one.
Any suggestion?

Thanks, it reads better.

In general, if a feature is not supported by the common KVM CPU caps, I prefer not
to add it to the list to save a few lines of code, which probably is dead code,
unless people find it too confusing.
I can add a comment to clarify this.

This does change the values returned by KVM_TDX_CAPABILITIES. However, my
understanding is that userspace is generally expected to only configure
features supported by both KVM and TDX, i.e. except for the features initialized
via TDX_CFG_EXTRA_F(), userspace is not expected to configure features not advertised
by kvm_cpu_caps[].
I can call this out in the changelog, and maybe also the doc for KVM_TDX_CAPABILITIES.

>

Because CORE_CAPABILITIES was previously defined as fixed-1 in some old spec and
the QEMU marks it as fixed1. EST/TM2/SDBG/XTPR/DCA are not the case.
