I was actually reading through Bo Gan's patchset when I noticed this
series, trying to get my thoughts in order and figured a second set of
eyes and thoughts would be helpful to me.

I've got a similar opinion to yours about the EIC7700 solution, it's
quite invasive (it'd only be 3rd party if it wasn't accepted) but I
would consider something invasive firmware wise to be worthwhile if no
peripheral on the device worked without it.

And, as I said, Bo Gan was of the opinion that all of the peripherals
require it. Of course I suspect that actually meant all DMA capable
peripherals require it, not all peripherals (especially given there's
been patchsets adding simpler peripherals).

That said, Samuel's solution does exist and if the feedback was
implemented by someone that cared about the eic7700 it'd be much more
acceptable. The fact that you've got a solution here at at least works
on an interim basis for the JH7110 (although I have no idea what the DRM
folks will think of it) is another point in Samuel's method's favour.

Thanks. I've got a much better idea of what to say to Bo Gan now.

Conor.
