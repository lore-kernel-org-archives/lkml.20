Hi Rafel, thank you so much for the point.
I'd like to address the concerns, see below:

(1) Sashiko review:
"Does this incorrectly use the total highatomic reserve capacity instead
of just the free pages within the reserve?
Since zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES) only counts pages that are actually
free, using zone->nr_reserved_highatomic (which tracks the total capacity
of highatomic pageblocks, including already-allocated pages) effectively
includes allocated highatomic pages in the unusable count."

d'oh, I was misread that I developed and tested this change on a
6.1-based tree, where struct zone only has nr_reserved_highatomic and
__zone_watermark_unusable_free() still uses it; nr_free_highatomic was
introduced later by [1]. It should be changed to:

unusable = READ_ONCE(zone->nr_free_highatomic)

(2) Sashiko review:
"Could this subtraction of the inflated unusable count underestimate the
usable free memory?
If so, this might cause the preallocation phase in
hibernate_preallocate_memory() to allocate fewer pages than it optimally
could, resulting in an unnecessarily larger hibernation image."

Yes, that is the other half of the same problem. Subtracting an inflated
value makes count and avail_normal smaller than the memory that is
actually usable, so preallocate_image_memory() stops early and the image
ends up larger than necessary. The same change fixes it as point #1: with
nr_free_highatomic the value subtracted is exactly the amount the
allocator cannot hand out, so the estimate is no longer inflated.

I'll submit v2 accordingly if there's no further concern.
