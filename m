I.e. unifying and adding coherency would be what I would emphasize
here not shortcircuiting the actual issues and adding special
conditions.

I think this change is optimizing for being non-distruptive as an
optimal goals e.g., by not reconsidering TPM ops etc. and like
the bird eye picture. I think this would be a good chance to
do something much more long term than this.

This is BTW something to look up for with LLM generated changes: LLMs
often optimize towards a bug fix type of minimum side-effect change. It
is probably good to make this type of reflection when pre-checking any
feature patch. I'm not complaining, this isjust something that I just
realized. Just another way to look up whether LLM generated result is
"good" or "bad" because it is very easy to get a blind eye for this.
