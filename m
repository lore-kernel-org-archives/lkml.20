Thanks, I'll fix this in v5 accordingly.

You're right. I'll correct both address decodes and the other PERROR
issues you listed: INV/SERR validity, ECC commands and syndrome, missing
error messages, window flags and SGE granularity.

I can't justify that limit or the borrowed Titan dismissal policy. I'll
remove the rule for v5 and report these aborts.

Agreed. I'll acknowledge the observed defined PERROR W1C bits and
MISC<NXM>.

I haven't verified its clearing behavior for either register. I'll remove
that assumption and explicitly acknowledge any live error bits remaining.

Agreed. I'll drop the PERRMASK change from v5 and leave the firmware
setting unchanged. Any follow-up enabling more errors will need hardware
testing, exclusion of reserved bit 9, and saving/restoring the old mask.

Agreed, I'll make those fatal.

I'll delegate processor vectors to EV6 and preserve expected probe
machine checks. I'll also remove the unused Titan interrupt mask, use
the summary flags to select Pchip errors, and fix the logging issues.

Yes, that's a typo. My copy is EK-ES240-SV A01 too.

Thanks, I'll fix these, honor the print argument, and keep supply-enable

Plugging/unplugging PSU power on my ES40 produced the expected
power-supply indication. I'll correct the message to =E2=80=9CSystem Power =
Supply
failure detected=E2=80=9D. I haven't specifically tested the OCP/RMC halt o=
r reset
bits, so their polarity remains unverified.

Agreed; I haven't verified the other platforms' environmental layouts.
I'll limit this decode to Clipper and register console-log handling for
all Tsunami boards.

Will do. With PERRMASK deferred, v5 will have four patches. I'll also
address the duplicate definitions, table placement and other cleanups
you listed, and keep the revision history out of the commit messages.

An AlphaServer ES40. For environmental events I plugged/unplugged PSU
power cables and opened hatches. For software-triggered tests I used a
module calling callsys() in kernel mode, this will trigger a machine check,
with modified handling to simulate errors. These tests don't establish real
ECC/parity fault recovery or SRM's clearing behavior. But it gave me a tool
to inject error codes and ensure correct parsing in the error handler.

I'll rework the patch into a series and send it out as soon as possible.

Thanks again,
Magnus
