Fair enough, we can consider that once we finalise what we have in this
set is the way to progress(not important until then).

Yes, exactly.

Ah, I thought that's the way the whole domain-idle was modelled as we
started this OSI discussion a decade ago with an example of CPU clusters
sharing power domains with some other devices. I am surprised if that is
not the case already 🙁.

But the s2idle and s2ram anyways suspends all the devices, so they need
to vote in for the power domains to be turned off. If they are supposed
to stay on, the system enters the state it can based on the other votes.

Still not convinced, if all devices are plugged in to the power domain
hierarchy correctly and the domain-idle states represent or carries
the entire system power domain topology, we shouldn't need this extra
information. Having it make cause issues when it conflicts with the
topology information IMO.
