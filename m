Following up on this with an update. Yosry let me know off-list that
ALLOC_UNMAPPED is on hold for now (quoted with permission):

Since the integration with Google's internal ASI implementation needs
more time, Yosry also agreed that I pick up the AS_NO_DIRECT_MAP work
for guest_memfd, separate from ALLOC_UNMAPPED. Here is how I plan to
proceed. Feedback is very welcome, especially from Sean on section 2
below.

1. MM and KVM parts together

I'm withdrawing my earlier proposal to post AS_NO_DIRECT_MAP and the
secretmem conversion as a standalone MM series first. secretmem
removes kernel access to its memory entirely, but KVM still needs to
access some guest memory from the kernel. If the MM part lands first
and the guest_memfd integration then requires a different design, we
would have to rework it right after it lands. So I'd like to settle
the design with guest_memfd as a real user, and post the MM and KVM
parts together in a single series so that both sides can review the
whole picture. Once we agree on the overall design, I'm of course
happy to split it up so that each part can go through the MM and KVM
trees.

2. Kernel access to direct-map-removed memory

I agree with Sean [1] that the way to access such memory from the
kernel, whether it ends up as an extension of GUP or a new interface,
should be generic rather than specific to guest_memfd, so that other
users of direct-map-removed pages that may come along can use it too.
It is also still open who should establish the kernel mapping: MM
could do it transparently, or callers could create one explicitly on
demand, either with existing MM mechanisms or with a new one like the
mermap. I don't have a concrete design in mind yet.

As a first step towards that, I'd like to:

  - List the use cases that stop working when GUP rejects
    AS_NO_DIRECT_MAP mappings. On the KVM side, these are mainly the
    gfn_to_pfn_cache users (kvmclock and the Xen shared pages) and
    kvm_vcpu_map() (mostly nested VMX/SVM). Accesses through uaccess,
    such as kvm_read_guest(), are not affected.

  - Look into each use case and sort out its requirements, e.g.
    whether it needs only the PFN, a short-lived kernel mapping, or a
    kernel mapping that stays valid for as long as the vCPU or VM
    uses it.

and then work out an appropriate design based on those requirements.
I'd only consider supporting the use cases incrementally where that
doesn't leave guest_memfd with a list of caveats or an ad hoc
interface.

3. ALLOC_UNMAPPED and the mermap

AS_NO_DIRECT_MAP itself works without them, by zapping the direct map
of each folio. However, guest_memfd will eventually need a temporary
kernel mapping to populate guest memory via write() [2], because
folios are already unmapped once they are added to the page cache.
The cost of TLB flushes and direct map fragmentation also matters for
performance, so I'd like to keep discussing these with folks
upstream, building on the direct map fragmentation discussion that
Kevin led at LPC [3].

Thanks,
Takahiro
