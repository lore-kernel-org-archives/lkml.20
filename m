So it will be specific to each FID range, then what is smart about
generic SMCCC logic then ?

We already have
	if (ret != SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED)
		arm_smccc_device_register(..)

Not sure what else can be done.

I didn't get that. The example above checks for minimum TRNG version,
so it won't break in any way for v2. What am I missing ?

Sure, it can be tried for future SMCCC based specs. We can't ignore the
inconsistency that exists in the currently used SMCCC based specs. So it
can't be ideal as you prefer I am afraid.

OK, I wasn't ware of that.
