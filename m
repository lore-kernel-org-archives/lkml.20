I guess that possible but TBH, it would probably be best to just ignore=20
my comment instead as I failed to take account the complications you came=
=20
across.


FYI, I'm planning on trying this series with my pci=3Drealloc recalc=20
changes to see if they together resolve the 64-bit VF BARs not appearing=20
on 64-bit side, hopefully I get that done today.
