There's two things to consider here:

* Does the UM care? The UM could write canary values to check that the
GPU has actually filled in the counters. Replacing them with "undefined"
values would break this behaviour. I'm not sure whether this is done -
but it can be used to check that the hardware is actually writing the
counter as expected.

* Is it a security hole? If the GPU cache was from when this BO was used
by another context then this is obviously bad. As Boris pointed out this
shouldn't be possible in the current driver if we're invalidating on unmap.

I think we need at least a comment explaining why this is safe. It does
seem that as things currently stand we don't actually need it though.

Thanks,
