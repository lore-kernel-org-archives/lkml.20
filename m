Done.  The implicit enable and the wbt_disable_default() are gone.
Attaching now checks disk_live() and creates the ioc under
rq_qos_mutex, like blkg_conf_open_bdev() does, and switches the
active model under the same freeze and quiesce sequence as the
io.cost.model writes.

To make sure I understood correctly: attaching switches the active
model to the attached BPF model, while model=linear and model=bpf
only switch between the attached model and the builtin model without
affecting the attachment itself.  The attachment survives enable=0,
and only .unreg removes it.  Please shout if I still got that wrong.

Done.  One note on the implementation: the existing iocgs are walked
over q->blkg_list under q->blkcg_mutex, the same walk the blkcg
policy teardown uses, rather than over the cgroup tree - this is a
per-device walk and the queue is frozen and quiesced at that point.
Cgroups without a blkg on the device yet are not missed: their blkg
is created later and ioc_pd_init()/ioc_pd_free() deliver the
callbacks then, so init and free pair up either way.

Done as suggested; the bpf-ci review of v7 reported the same two.

Thanks.
