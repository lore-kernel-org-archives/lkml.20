By the way, with my understanding, only grow is enough for xswap. You
can reserve a huge space for it, while in fact you could only really use
it within a small space. Then it's fine, grow the swap_cluster_info[] to
the place it ever used, and it mostly will be used again. E.g on a small
system with 10G RAM, we set si->max as 2x10=20G. In fact it could only
reach 2G swap space. That's fine. 2G is the place we need, keep it. The
left 18G is untouched and surely no swap_cluster_info[] built for it.
Anyway, Nhat strongly suggested shrink is necessary. I am wondering if
there's really use case.
