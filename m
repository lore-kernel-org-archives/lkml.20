That was more about being self-consistent and technically compliant with 
VMSAv7, which again is not relevant to SMMUv3. In fact if we _only_ had 
to support SMMUv3 and not arbitrary other io-pgtable users then we could 
point to 13.1.7 "Ensuring consistent output attributes" to prove that 
that change would not have been necessary.

Sure, and another system could only support iNC-oWB, wherein this change 
still wouldn't work. If you want to argue against making assumptions 
about the implementation/interconnect, you can't simply make a slightly 
different assumption about the implementation/interconnect ;)

In fact for maximum fun, you could even have an interconnect that only 
supports the iWB-oWB-ISH type, but the SMMU is still non-coherent since 
it's in a _different_ inner shareability domain from the CPUs...

Yes, 13.1.2 "Attribute support" says that the system may not support all 
memory types, and unsupported ones may abort, but then equally it says 
"[...] the SMMU is not required to generate attributes that it does not 
use. With the exception of R/W, INST, and PRIV all configuration fields 
that affect unused attributes are IGNORED." And this is why the 
mismatched attributes argument doesn't stand up on its own - without 
knowing the system-specific details of exactly what is being ignored 
from what we think we've programmed, how can we say what the actual 
attributes used to access memory really are, and thus what is or isn't 
mismatched?

Thanks,
Robin.
