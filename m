You are right, NKEY_REPORT_SIZE. This is what my patch did. It was
late yesterday.

Let me simplify. Please try to stay on topic.

My XG Mobile is an Aura device using FEATURE_KBD_LED_REPORT_ID2 with a
feature report size of 300. Your XG Mobile is an Aura device that uses
the same. They both have the same sleep issue that you paper over by
setting the brightness to 0. The LED stays on during sleep. It also
stays on / off during boot and the power command works inconsistently
with it. Which points to the device not knowing boot state and missing
a command to inform it.

The asusctl driver handles aura devices. However, instead of using the
current aura cdev handler and init handling you introduce a SECOND ONE
THAT DOES THE SAME THING and is not connected to the central keyboard
brightness handler.

Why do you do that? Can you justify the new cdev? What's wrong with
the normal one? Why do we need a new ABI just for the 2022-2024 eGPU
models?

I am not arguing on which command is correct to send. Keep the flow
the same if you want
