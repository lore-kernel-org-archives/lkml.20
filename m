can: peak_usb: validate channel numbers in PCAN-USB FD

This patch changes the channel number check in the four PCAN-USB FD
decoders. The old bound was ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev). The new bound is the
adapter's ctrl_count, read through an adapter pointer that is now stored in
struct pcan_usb_fd_if. Invalid channels now return -EINVAL instead of
-ENOMEM.

> supported by the adapter before performing the lookup. Any message

[Severity: Low]
Is "out-of-bounds" the right description here? This was the old check:

	if (pucan_msg_get_channel(rm) >= ARRAY_SIZE(usb_if->dev))

dev[] has PCAN_USB_MAX_CHANNEL (2) entries. No index outside dev[0..1]
could get past that check before this patch.

What this patch seems to fix is a NULL pointer dereference on the
single-channel adapters, PCAN-USB FD and PCAN-Chip USB. Both use
.ctrl_count = PCAN_USBFD_CHANNEL_COUNT (1). pcan_usb_fd_init() only fills
usb_if->dev[dev->ctrl_idx], and usb_if comes from kzalloc. On those
adapters dev[1] therefore stays NULL.

Before this patch, a device record with channel 1 passed the "< 2" check.
Then, in URB completion context:

  pcan_usb_fd_decode_canmsg(), _decode_status() and _decode_overrun()
      read dev->netdev
  pcan_usb_fd_decode_error()
      wrote pdev->bec through container_of(NULL)

Could the commit message name this device-triggered NULL dereference and
the affected adapters? There is no Cc: stable tag, so this matters for
backport decisions.

The "entire message buffer is discarded" wording also reads as if this
patch adds that behaviour. The goto fail path in pcan_usb_fd_decode_buf()
is unchanged. Records decoded before the bad one have already been passed
up via netif_rx(), and only the bad record and the ones after it are
dropped.

On the -EINVAL change: pcan_usb_fd_decode_error() and
pcan_usb_fd_decode_overrun() already returned -EINVAL before this patch.
peak_usb_read_bulk_callback() also ignores the returned error code.

[Severity: High]
Does this guarantee hold? The ctrl_count check keeps the index inside
dev[], but nothing makes sure usb_if->dev[channel] points to a live
device.

On the 2-channel adapters (PCAN-USB Pro FD and PCAN-USB X6, ctrl_count =
PCAN_USBPROFD_CHANNEL_COUNT = 2), the new check is the same as the old
ARRAY_SIZE() check.

pcan_usb_fd_decode_status(), pcan_usb_fd_decode_error() and
pcan_usb_fd_decode_overrun() repeat the same comment and check.

The first case is a NULL entry during probe. peak_usb_probe() creates
channels one at a time, and peak_usb_create_dev() registers the netdev
before it calls dev_init():

peak_usb_create_dev()
    register_candev(netdev);
    ...
    dev->adapter->dev_init(dev);
        pcan_usb_fd_init()
            pdev->usb_if->dev[dev->ctrl_idx] = dev;

Once channel 0 is registered and initialised, can0 can be brought up while
dev[1] is still NULL. The window covers channel 0's dev_set_bus() and
dev_get_can_channel_id() bulk commands, which the device can stall for up
to 1000 ms each. It also covers register_candev() for can1.

Opening can0 submits RX URBs on the bulk-IN endpoint that both channels
share. pcan_usb_fd_decode_buf() routes each record by its own channel
field.

Could a channel-1 record then pass the "1 >= 2" test and dereference NULL
through dev->netdev here? The same would apply to dev->can.state in
pcan_usb_fd_decode_status() and to the write to pdev->bec in
pcan_usb_fd_decode_error().

The second case is a dangling entry when probe fails. If channel 1's
dev_set_bus() fails after dev_init(), peak_usb_create_dev() takes this
path:

adap_dev_free:
	if (dev->adapter->dev_free)
		dev->adapter->dev_free(dev);

lbl_unregister_candev:
	unregister_candev(netdev);

pcan_usb_fd_free() does nothing for a device that has prev_siblings set,
and it never clears usb_if->dev[1]:

static void pcan_usb_fd_free(struct peak_usb_device *dev)
{
	/* last device: can free shared objects now */
	if (!dev->prev_siblings && !dev->next_siblings) {

dev1 is then freed. peak_usb_probe() calls peak_usb_disconnect() directly,
without usb_disable_interface(), so can0's RX URBs are still live.

Can a channel-1 record arriving in that window reach freed memory? That
includes the write in pcan_usb_fd_decode_error().

Disconnects started by the USB core (unplug, sysfs unbind, rmmod) do not
seem to be affected. peak_usb_driver does not set soft_unbind, so
usb_unbind_interface() kills the URBs before ->disconnect().

The follow-up commit "can: peak_usb: harden PCAN-USB message validation"
only touches pcan_usb.c and does not cover this.

Would it be more complete to treat a NULL usb_if->dev[ch] as a malformed
message in each FD decoder? That would also cover the single-channel case
this patch targets.

Clearing the entry on per-channel teardown or failure would handle the
dangling case. The comment would also need to be corrected.
