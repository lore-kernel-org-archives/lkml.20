Thanks for taking a look.

You are right that the file and Kconfig layers already isolate the v1
implementation at build time, and =n builds get nothing from this
series. The benefit is only for =y builds.

In a =y build today, the deprecated controller's state is still
embedded directly in struct mem_cgroup and common code accesses it
directly. This series moves that state behind a single
struct mem_cgroup_v1, complementing the existing file- and
Kconfig-level separation at the data structure level. The layout is
unchanged, so there is no runtime cost.

My intention was to explore whether this could serve as a general
pattern for isolating the remaining cgroup v1-only state, rather than
as a standalone memcg cleanup. I should have made that context clearer
in the cover letter.

If that isn't sufficient to justify the churn, I understand.

Thanks,
Tao
