bind/unbind now causes a taint, so what is the real problem here?  A
root user is poking around and causing problems, so any error is their
fault for doing this?

Because this has always been present, and no one has actually reported
this, perhaps it is not really a problem at all?  In other words, what
real-life-use requires this?  Again, bind/unbind is for developers only.

Where is the formal verification proof?  Please don't have your LLM
claim this without that as it's pointless.

I don't understand, this is not a place where a "race" can happen.
