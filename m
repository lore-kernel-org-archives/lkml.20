I don't quite understand why though, if anything it should land before
this hotplug series? (It really should've landed with MIN/MAX_PERF
support or at least to prepare for AUTOSEL support?)
I don't disagree with Jie that a sane platforms should be able to handle
transient violations, but IMO just adhering to the spec here (which
is absolutely doable) ensures that we never have to support a bunch of
quirks sometime in the future, when we do want to be more strict about
the spec.

In any case, after my v7 ACPI CPPC fixes land (fingers crossed this time),
it seems pretty straightforward (and even a tiny optimization at that!).
Here's what I had in mind, what do you think?
(Lightly tested, without seeing any violations. Needs some wiring
into your series and would appreciate testing with AUTOSEL.)

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: CPPC: Order performance-control updates

The ACPI specification requires Minimum Performance to remain below
Maximum Performance. When autonomous selection is disabled, Desired
Performance must also remain within those limits.

cppc_set_perf() writes the three controls in a fixed order. This can expose
an invalid tuple after firmware resets the controls or while policy bounds
move across the current desired value.

Read the live limits. Apply non-atomic updates in three phases: widen the
interval, update Desired Performance, then narrow it. Submit PCC controls
in each phase together. Keep the existing single-command path when the
complete tuple is in PCC, reject invalid requests, and stop after the first
failed access.

Make cppc_cpufreq fast switches include the limits only when they differ
from the last successful request. Invalidate the cache across resume and
after a failed request, since firmware may have reset the controls or an
earlier phase of a failed update may have reached the platform. Publish
slow-path limits only after the complete request succeeds.

At policy teardown, lower Minimum Performance together with Desired
Performance so the final request remains valid. On initialization, clamp
Desired Performance to the live interval left by firmware or an earlier
driver instance.
