That's a very fair question. Let me walk through the impact of this patch
across the various subsystems in detail below.

In fact, the initial motivation for this patch stemmed from a slab patch
discussion: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/amHldYIo_-Bgm7Ek@fedora/, so also
Cc'ing the slab folks. But in retrospect, its impact on list_lru is somewhat
more subtle.

1. Impact on list_lru (the most widely affected path)

   a. list_lru_register and list_lru_unregister previously performed pointless
   memcg_list_lrus operations. With this patch, both functions become no-ops.

   b. In list_lru_from_memcg_idx, previously, because memcg was disabled, any
   input idx reaching this function was guaranteed to be -1, so the `if` branch
   was never taken. With this patch, the `if` branch is still not taken, so the
   control flow remains unaffected.

   c. In list_lru_add_obj / list_lru_del_obj, they previously performed some
   unnecessary RCU operations in the if branch, and mem_cgroup_from_virt
   returned NULL, meaning there was essentially no difference between the `if`
   and `else` branches. With this patch, they directly take the else branch.

   d. In list_lru_walk_node, before this patch, because memcg was disabled,
   there were no elements in lru->xa. The function had already completed its
   task once list_lru_walk_one finished, making the subsequent xa_for_each
   inside the `if` block effectively a no-op. With this patch, these pointless
   no-ops are skipped directly at the `if` check.

   e. memcg_destroy_list_lru was previously a no-op as well because lru->xa
   contained no elements. With this patch, the function bails out early,
   causing no functional change.

   f. memcg_list_lru_alloc / folio_memcg_list_lru_alloc were previously
   unreachable because memcg was disabled or objcg was NULL, so applying this
   patch has no impact here either.

   g. memcg_init_list_lru previously initialized lru->xa. With this patch, it
   is no longer initialized. This is safe because all paths attempting to
   access lru->xa are either guarded by list_lru_memcg_aware(), or become
   no-ops due to memcg_list_lrus being empty.

   In summary, the impact of this patch on list_lru either preserves the
   existing execution flow or saves unnecessary operations, introducing no
   adverse side effects.

   Additionally, when shrinker_memcg_alloc detects that memcg is disabled, it
   returns -ENOSYS to let shrinker_alloc clear the SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE flag.
   This confirms that the shrinker does not care about memcg list_lru when
   memcg is disabled, further corroborating that this patch aligns with the
   shrinker's design rationale.

2. Impact on slab KMALLOC_CGROUP is aliased to KMALLOC_NORMAL instead of
   getting its own set of caches, and __kmem_cache_create_args no longer sets
   SLAB_MAY_ACCOUNT, eliminating the need to allocate the obj_cgroup vector.

3. Impact on need_pcpuobj_ext and pcpu_obj_full_size When
   CONFIG_MEM_ALLOC_PROFILING=n, there is no longer a need to allocate
   pcpuobj_ext. pcpu_obj_full_size is not affected as objcg no longer exist
   when kmem account is disabled.

4. Impact on memcg_online_kmem / memcg_offline_kmem memcg_offline_kmem is
   unreachable when memcg is disabled, and memcg_online_kmem will bail out at
   mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled, so memcg_kmem_online_key is still not set.

Finally, with CONFIG_MEMCG=n, mem_cgroup_disabled() and
mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled() both return true. Therefore, making
mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled() also return true under CONFIG_MEMCG=y with
cgroup_disable=memory seems reasonable and consistent.

Untangling all the combinations of whether memcg and kmem accounting are
enabled is surprisingly intricate! Please feel free to point it out if I've
missed anything.
