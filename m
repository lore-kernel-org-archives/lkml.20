The observation makes sense.  However, does the sparse access pattern
realistic?  If so, what is the purpose or expected benefit of using huge page
for workloads having such access pattern?

I'm not very sure if this is the right direction.  PMD mapping demotion sounds
like you just don't want to use huge pages.  If so, you could disable huge
pages.  Answers to my above questions would be helpful for me.

I believe this doesn't conflict with the project, though.  Nevertheless,
technically speaking, it is not the report semantics.  Reporting allows any
information to be reported.  Page faults like information could be coarse
grained, same to the current page table accessed-bit based one.  Only finer
grained access primitive reports, like those from perf events, would increase
the accuracy for the sparse access pattern monitoring.

Whether sparse access pattern is realistic and using huge pages on systems
having such access pattern makes sense are different questions, though.

Looking forward to!  Nonetheless, it would better to make sure we are on the
same page for the above questions before digging deeper, in my humble opinion.


Thanks,
SJ
