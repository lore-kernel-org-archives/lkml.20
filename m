Ok, I now see that the logic is you simply fail to proceed with writes
if the library's latest understood version is < last_comp_version_w.

As I said elsewhere, this approach doesn't particularly make sense to
me.  If lib_version >=3D last_comp_version you *can* write, even if it
means stripping everything that's not understood at lib_version.

So the real question here is how do we know, for any given structured
tag, what write operations require the version to be downgraded (which
might in turn require this and/or other structured tags to be stripped
entirely).

This is related to (though not the same as) the question of whether
introducing a new structured tags requires a bump to the dtb version
(though not to last_comp_version, of course).

Here's the simplest model I can think of.  It's what I'd suggest,
unless one of it's limitations is a showstopper for what you have in mind:

 - version and last_comp_version retain their meanings.  No new header
   version.
 - New structured tags *do* require a new version.  If a dtb wants to
   include a specific tag, it must label itself with a version that
   defines that tag.  To enforce that:
    - For read operations, if we encounter a (known) tag that
      doesn't belong in the header version, we throw an error (either
      BADSTRUCTURE, or a new error for the purpose).
       - If version <=3D FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION and we encounter an
         unknown tag that also trips the error (since if it was
	 defined in this version, we should know about it).
    - For write operations (including in-place), we always error if
      version > FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION (done in fdt_rw_probe_()).
    - fdt_open_into() _is_ permitted if version > FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSIO=
N.
      It will strip all unknown structured tags from the entire tree
      and downgrade the version to FDT_LAST_SUPPORTED_VERSION.

This does mean that every new tag does require a new version, which
may make experimenting with new tags more awkward.  More
significantly, it also means that any change requires a version
downgrade, even if it's just updating a handful of properties.

On the plus side, it's fairly simple, retains as much as possible
current version semantics.  Most especially there's no tricky
questions about what sorts of writes might invalidate an unknown tag
(they'll all be stripped by the time we permit a write operation).

If those limitations really are a showstopper, I do have a few other
models that might work, though.

Sure, but it can still add whole new nodes or properties.  The
question is whether a version can mandate the presence of certain
tags.  Dowgrading the version when we strip tags from a modified
property suggests "yes", but _not_ downgrading the version when we
add new property suggests "no".
