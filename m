The EFI table is only written when there is a memory failure. That is
the only thing that writes to it:

	action_result() -> efi_hwpoison_record_pfn() -> set_bit()

You can see it on patch "mm/memory-failure: efi: record
hardware-poisoned frames into the poisoned-memory table"

Then, when the kernel kexecs into a second kernel, the EFI config table
is queried and the pages are poisoned from it at boot, as they are
getting into the buddy allocator, in __free_pages_core().

You can see this at patch "mm/memory-failure: keep inherited poisoned
frames out of the buddy allocator"

Ack. What I have in mind is to make the read side mirror the write side:

	efi_hwpoison_record_pfn()	writes
	efi_hwpoison_recorded()		reads

"efi_" says where it comes from and "recorded" says an earlier kernel
wrote it down, rather than it being a property of the page.

On the "early" part: it is not strictly early boot, since
generic_online_page() reaches __free_pages_core() as well. The real
contract is "before the frame enters the allocator". I don't think a
name carries that, so I'd rather state it in a comment on the function,
unless you prefer something like efi_hwpoison_recorded_preinit().

Every hard offline does, yes, and by the same path:

	action_result() -> efi_hwpoison_record_pfn() -> set_bit()

Three deliberate exceptions, so the sync is one-way and conservative
rather than exact:

    - soft offline sets PG_hwpoison but no bit, on purpose: those are
      functional pages offlined predictively, and we do not want to turn
      them into a permanent loss for every kernel down the chain.

    - a bit is never cleared on unpoison, because a bit stands for 2M and
      cannot tell whether the whole unit is good again. So the table is a
      superset of PG_hwpoison, never a subset.

    - a bit covers 2M, a flag covers 4K, so one bad frame comes back as
      512 flagged frames in the next boot.

One more case is a bug rather than a design point: the
MF_MSG_ALREADY_POISONED guard also skips the record, so a hard error on
a frame that was soft offlined earlier is never recorded. Sashiko caught
it, and v6 moves the call out of the stats guard.

True for the frames the table marks, so the walk could be narrowed to
those and not test the flag at all (untested):

static void memblk_nr_poison_init(struct memory_block *mem)
{
	....
	for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++) {
		struct page *page = pfn_to_online_page(pfn + i);

		if (!page)
			continue;
		if (!efi_hwpoison_recorded(PFN_PHYS(pfn + i), PAGE_SIZE))
			continue;

		nr_poison++;
	}

Not racy: memblk_nr_poison_init() only ever runs at boot. It is gated on
MEM_ONLINE, and only one of the two callers passes that.

	memory_dev_init()		-> MEM_ONLINE	(boot)
	create_memory_block_devices()	-> MEM_OFFLINE	(hotplug)

So the hotplug path returns on the first line and never walks, and at
the point the boot path walks, the only thing that has set PG_hwpoison
in that block is hwpoison_boot_page().

For the initrd and the image, the previous kernel's record cannot stop
this kernel's loader from placing them on a bad frame. If that happens
we consumed the poison in the relocation memcpy, long before any of this
code runs. That is the kexec segment placement problem, which Kiryl
raised on the RFC and which I split into its own series, which is landed
in some mm tree already.

The walk exists precisely because of that inconsistency: the counter has
to match the frames that actually carry the flag, and the bitmap says
more than that.

If we drop the page walk, then there is change for inconsistency, but,
as-is, there is no inconsistency.

So, I am planning to keep the page walk above, when there is a poisoned
page in the memory block, avoiding any inconsitency.
