I dislike those code paths in vswap as well.

I found this new concept of "compression space" very confusing to me.
Can you explain the swap behavior and problem using only normal memory
usage reduction and latency without introducing a new term or new
metrics?

The normal user doesn't even know what compression space is, let alone
what makes it transparent.

In my mind, swap trades RSS memory reduction for increased latency
when accessing the swapped-out data.
Whether the memory reduction is by compression or by writing to a hard
drive is an implementation detail. It has different characteristics.

When we have "compressed space" for zswap, should we also have "ssd
space" for data store in ssd and "hdd space" for data stored on HDD?
They has different IO accessing latencies.

I feel that you are arguing a conceptual construct you define. Can you
explain the difference using external measurable metrics? For example
in this workload, using vswap, the user sees workload latency as X,
throughput as Y, and memory usage as Z. Using xswap, the user sees a
different X1, Y1, Z1. Then we can reason why X, Y, Z is better or
worse than X1, Y1, Z1.

My simpler brain just doesn't see why this new compression space matters.

Why does the user need to care about compression space again?

The user cares how much memory it can save and what performance price
to pay for it.
Why does the user need to care about compression space again? We've
used zswap/ZRAM and other swap mechanisms for a long time without ever
hearing about "compression space". Why now?

Again what exactly does compression space do that can't be explained
by external metrics e.g. memory saved and the performance penalty on
access?

Please help me understand.
