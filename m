I don't see anything immediately wrong, but I suspect I am just
not looking hard enough.

In my time working with the kernel I have never seen anyone actually get
this kind of thing correct.

The handoff that we do during exec has a bug with posix timers that
I think is 23 years old that we just caught, and still hasn't been
merged to Linus.

There was the old daemonize call that got it wrong so often I added
kthreadd.


Maybe you want something like the old solaris doors, or vfork.
Perform a synchronous task switch to this other thread, and call this
function in the other thread.  Then block waiting on the other thread
until the other thread blocks, or the function you called finishes.

Is there a reason you didn't try and do it that way?
Just a synchronous switch to and from a thread in your thread pool?

You aren't changing the mm so I really doubt changing the stack pointer
and a registers will be that expensive.
