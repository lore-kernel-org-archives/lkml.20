I do see an advantage in having the taint in match() rather than store(), s=
o I
prefer that too.

But again, I do not feel comfortable to taint the kernel for something that=
 does
use the wrong API but otherwise behaves correctly and shouldn't taint the k=
ernel
at all.

We have six users of device_set_driver_override() outside of a userspace
reachable scope. Did you have a look at how hard they are to fix? Do you pl=
an to
provide patches?

That sounds fine to me.
