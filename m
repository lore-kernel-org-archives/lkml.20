I don't see the difference, but I guess that's a good thing anyway :)

I somewhat agree, the somewhat being I don't think we should go for that
end result at all cost. We don't know how long it's going to complete,
how much you're going to be involved in this going forward, etc. so I
think the intermediate steps should be reasonable (even if not perfect)
and ok to carry for an indefinite amount of time.
