Do you mean that the SKIP_SAFE bit should be removed ?

I like the defined structure with the DATA_LEN_ENCODING part. Even for tags
which are not "skippable".

This ensures a kind of standardized format for all future tags instead of a 
specific definition (related to the length of the data) for each new tag.

For this kind of information related to the length of data, I prefer a global
rule instead of tag-specific rules.

Ok, will be updated.

Ok, will be updated.

Will be update as well.

In term of code complexity, FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE introduced in the addons
series, patch 7/74 [0], is a 1-cell (or 1-fdt32) "structured" tag.

It can be compared with FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE_REF, introduced in patch 11/74 [1].
FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE_REF is a "Data length encoding" tag.

Modifications in libfdt/fdt.c are pretty similar for both tags.

ok, I will avoid the term "cell" in the next iteration.

Ok, I will avoid the constant and use sizeof(fdt32_t) directly when needed
in the code.

Also, I will avoid the CELL in all other part of this file.
