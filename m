Even if we take RMI as an example, SMC_RMI_ABI_VERSION returns the
lowest and highest supported interface versions.

After a firmware upgrade, either value can change. Unless the existing
kernel supports an interface version within the advertised range, the
upgrade will break compatibility. Including the major version in the
modalias does not help with this.

Even with separate kernel drivers for versions 1 and 2, we still face
the same issue. If the firmware initially supports version 1 and an
upgrade raises the lowest supported version to 2, the version 2 driver
can handle it. However, that is functionally equivalent to a single
driver supporting both interface versions. If the current kernel does
not support version 2, either through a single driver or a separate
driver, the firmware upgrade will break compatibility.
