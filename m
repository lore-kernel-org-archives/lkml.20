As described in the dm-integrity documentation, dm-integrity supports
non-cryptographic checksums for protection from accidental corruption.
That use case is no different from any other use case of a checksum.

It's also no different from using crc32 or crc32c, which similarly have
fips_allowed=1 and this patch completely ignores.

The solution is not banning checksums or making any other code change,
but rather just doing what it seems everyone has already been doing:
documenting in their FIPS security policy that checksums are only for
use cases that are not "security functions".
