That all sounds good.  How about if I ask Linus to pull Mario's AMD
SMN fix for v7.3, since that seems to be PCI-related, and then you can
decide how/when to take the quirk revert, since that seems to be
ATA-related?

I'll ask Linus to pull the AMD SMN fix today, so you could still
revert the quirk for v7.3 also if you wanted.  It sounds like there
might be more details that could be included in the quirk revert,
e.g., the fact that the quirk caused issues on Raspberry Pi and the
fact that the problem the quirk address was fixed by commit X.
