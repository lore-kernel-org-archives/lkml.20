Subject: [PATCH v4 00/18] KVM: arm64: Confine protected VM vCPU state to EL2

Hi folks,

Changes since v3 [1]:
  - A protected vCPU that EL2 holds powered off reads as
    KVM_MP_STATE_UNINITIALIZED, in place of a new bool. (Marc)
  - The marshalling and PSCI patches access the host copy through the
    vCPU accessors, with every assignment on one line. (Marc)
  - The PC adjustment pair is kvm_adjust_pc_get()/put() and tests for
    the hyp vCPU directly. (Marc)
  - CPU_OFF clears the reset flag before its release of OFF, CPU_ON's
    relaxed cmpxchg is ordered by its control dependency, and the
    CPU_ON rollback stores OFF with a release. pkvm_reset_vcpu()
    carries the CPU_ON/CPU_OFF sequence as a comment and drops its
    WARN_ON(). (Vincent, Will)
  - Collected Reviewed-bys.

Following the vCPU state-sync series [3], this series completes the
job for protected VMs: a protected guest's register state stays at
EL2, and the host sees only what handling each exit requires.

EL2 marshals a protected vCPU's state per exception class instead of
copying the whole context both ways. It owns the vCPU's trap
configuration, system register reset and HVC handling, and implements
PSCI itself: AFFINITY_INFO is left to the host, and CPU_ON and CPU_OFF
are resolved at EL2 with the host only scheduling the target or
stopping it. A protected guest's TRNG calls, which the host handled
until now, return NOT_SUPPORTED until TRNG for protected guests
follows. EL2 implements PSCI 1.1, so a protected guest also loses the
functions the host supports above that version, SYSTEM_OFF2 included.
Host ioctls that would reach the state EL2 owns fail with -EPERM, so a
protected VM's state isn't save/restorable. All of this is scoped
to KVM_VM_TYPE_ARM_PROTECTED, and pkvm.rst describes the resulting API.

The kvmtool changes that go with this are posted separately [4].

Patches 1 to 3 go out separately: the HCR_EL2.VSE fix [5], and the
host vCPU VM read and pin fixes, patches 4 and 5 of the host hypercall
fixes series [2]. None of the three is part of this series. They're
carried so the series applies as is and Sashiko can run on it.

The KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET documentation fix [6] went out just ahead
of v1. Nothing here depends on it to apply, but patch 18 documents vCPU
feature availability as something the capabilities report, while
api.rst 4.83 still points userspace at a bitmap that has always been
empty.

The series is structured as follows:

  01:     The HCR_EL2.VSE fix, posted separately.
  02-03:  The host vCPU VM read and pin fixes, posted separately.
  04:     Steal time disabled for protected VMs.
  05-06:  Per-exception-class entry handlers; EL2 owns a protected
          vCPU's trap configuration.
  07-09:  Timer state, system register reset and HVC handling at EL2.
  10-11:  PSCI at EL2, and the KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT and PSCI version
          restrictions.
  12-14:  Host PC adjustments blocked; an UNDEF at EL2 for exit
          classes the host doesn't emulate; per-class state
          marshalling.
  15-16:  Host changes to private state, and host power-on of a vCPU
          EL2 holds powered off, rejected.
  17:     Capability allowlist.
  18:     Documentation.

Still to come: selftests, TRNG, self-hosted debug and SVE for protected
guests, and much more, as separate series.

Based on v7.3-rc3 (fd73f4a665989).

Cheers,
/fuad
