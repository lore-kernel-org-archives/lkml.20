My suggestion (but only for new things / drivers to prevent any
compatibility issues) is to report / return fatal probe errors when
verification fails.

Here we are trying to mix two opposite things: static device-tree with
non-static hotpluggable / repluggable hardware. Similar problem has any
hotpluggable bus (PCIe, USB, SDIO, ...) which needs to be described in
device-tree (because bus itself static and burn into the chipset itself)
but endpoint nodes on the bus in DT are non-static.

This is what I saw more times... because it solved problem of "generic DT"
and "hacks in kernel drivers" by completely hiding the problem from
kernel and DT files point of view.

Yes. That is balancing between principles, real HW and how it is already
used by kernel drivers. I do not have any opinion for this as it looks
like that every solution would have some gaps or issues.

Sometimes the easiest (in a way of writing the code) solution is better
even if it does not fully match the design or principles.
