Ok, makes sense.

Ok, so adding the regular resource management to both sides here is
probably a good idea anyway, though it is not sufficient as long the
platform driver gets probed first.

Ah, interesting. So if the problem with the platform driver
is that the outbound windows are mismatched between the register
settings and the ranges property, wouldn't it make sense to always
set "brcm,pcie-ob" for boards that are known to have more than
one possible setting in their firmware?
That way I would hope the platform driver can just work in the cases
that currently fail.

Ok. I suspect this may cause problems when someone uses an MFD
device that needs to translate internal registers of child device
through the ranges. It's probably not a big deal since those devices
are rare, just something to keep in mind.
