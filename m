Hi Gabriele,

Thanks for the feedback.

For tlob, the primary goal is detecting deadline overruns on the order 
of milliseconds or sub-milliseconds (e.g. 10 ms budget).
Under HRTIMER_MODE_REL_SOFT on PREEMPT_RT, the timer callback runs in a
threaded softirq (ksoftirqd or threaded irq context).  If the system is
under CPU or scheduler pressure, the softirq latency itself can easily 
add several milliseconds of unpredictable delay.  When that happens, it
blurs attribution: users cannot distinguish whether the monitored task
exceeded its budget, or whether the task finished on time but the timer
callback was delayed in the scheduler queue.  HARD hrtimer avoids this 
by firing directly in hardirq context at the physical deadline.

Thanks.
On the in-kernel side, your DA_OBJ_EMBEDDED_TYPE PoC delivered
the exact same simplification.

In v8, we adopted DA_OBJ_EMBEDDED_TYPE so struct tlob_record is embedded
directly into struct da_monitor_storage:
- Deleted the private mempool and custom allocator entirely; tlob now
   relies 100% on the framework pre-allocated pool.
- Deleted the parallel state machine (OPEN / CLOSED / RETIRED) and
   tlob_binding_lock.  The window lifecycle is now driven purely by the
   automaton states (stopped, running, waiting, sleeping).
- Overall, tlob.c shrunk from ~1065 lines to ~660 lines (-38%), with no
   locking on the scheduler hot path.

We are currently testing and will send out v8 soon.
