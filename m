While the above is fine IMV, the enabled/disabled concept is more
fundamental because "active" and "suspended" are not really relevant
when runtime PM is disabled.  Yes, they need to be set properly before
enabling it and there is some complexity related to the integration
with system-wide PM, but generally speaking, if runtime PM is disabled
for a given device, its active/suspended status is irrelevant.

So it is not orthogonal.

This is only partially true because the PCI bus type, for instance,
enables runtime PM for all PCI devices and so it is enabled when
drivers get to them.

Moreover, parent-child and supplied-consumer dependencies are
generally not tracked for devices with disabled runtime PM.

Yes, and it needs to set the active/suspended status to reflect the
current physical state of the device before calling
pm_runtime_enable().

Yup, and the changes below look good.

Do the subsequent patches in the series depend on this one?
