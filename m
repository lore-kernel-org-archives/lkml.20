But it doesn't handle the use case I mentioned in a previous reply :(

bootloader knows about version 2.0
kernel knowns about version 3.0

dtb 3.0 we want the bootloader to skip tags it doesn't know about but this same
bootloader has to handle 'unknown' tags on some modification. We want to have 
possibilities to let this bootloader perform those modifications (under precise
known rules) and pass this dtb to the kernel.

Best regards,
Hervé
