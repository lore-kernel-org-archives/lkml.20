Thanks for all this detail.  I think it's too much for a commit log,
but it would be good to have it after the "---" where it's in the
email but not the git commit.  This is easily accessible via the
"Link: https://patch.msgid.link/" tag that we add when applying.

Wrap these to fit in 80 columns like the rest of the file.  Ideally 75
or so; that allows minor changes and typo fixes without overflowing.
