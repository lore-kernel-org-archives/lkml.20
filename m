That fits the existing model better than the special handling I
introduced.  I had missed that the cursor is set from the same
zone-start sector on every append, so back-to-back appends classify
sequential as expected, and that emulated appends already take the regular
WRITE path.

I'll drop the special case and the cursor skip in v3 and just add
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND to the REQ_OP_WRITE case.

Agreed, that's the right anchor - the gap appeared when the op was
added.  Both Fixes tags will be updated.

Thanks.
