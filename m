Agreed, and the workload I tested is on the "unless" side. The guest
exits constantly for other reasons, so the larger buffer never got a
chance to pay off, and only cost ring capacity.

For the workload question, it's a Redis server in the guest under redis-
benchmark (SET-only, 2KB values, 1M keys, 100M requests). The traffic is
network-driven, so the guest exits constantly to service requests. The
HDBSS buffer only accumulates entries between two exits and is flushed
on every exit, so it rarely fills regardless of size. A larger buffer
only inflated the ring reservation, which shrinks the soft_limit and
makes the ring-full exit and userspace drain fire more often.

It does make sense. That's exactly the workload where a larger buffer
pays off, and the next version no longer gets in its way. The two ioctls
are no longer mutually exclusive.

The only coupling left is the reservation. hdbss_buffer_size starts at
SZ_4K at VM creation, so a ring enabled right away reserves for the
default buffer (64 + 512 entries), and the minimum ring size accepted is
unchanged from v5. KVM_CAP_ARM_HDBSS_BUFFER_SIZE is the gate. When the
ring is already enabled, a size is accepted only if its reservation
still fits in the ring, otherwise -EINVAL. In the other order, ring-
enable validation rejects a ring too small for the configured size.

So SZ_4K is just the conservative default for guests that exit often.
Anything larger, within what the ring can reserve, is up to the user.

Does this work for you?

Thanks,
Tian
