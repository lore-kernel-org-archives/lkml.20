I have concerns regarding the new dependency on the FF-A driver.

Could you clarify how the build and runtime behavior are protected when the
FF-A driver is disabled? The current patchset introduces a strict dependency
without explicit configuration checks or guards, which will likely cause
compilation or execution failures in environments where FF-A is not enabled.

We need to explicitly document the reasons for establishing a hard dependency
between the ACPI FFH and the FF-A driver. In my view, this FFH mechanism (0x2)
simply issues an SMC call with the FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ2 FID. While I
understand the specification assigns extra responsibility to the OSPM to
populate the partition ID, are there any other technical justifications for
this tight coupling?

I see above as one reason why they need to be separate.

How about CONFIG_ARM_FFA_TRANSPORT=n and CONFIG_ACPI_FFH=y ? Is that
blocked in someway I am failing to see ?
