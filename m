Ok, I will keep it (and FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE_REF).

I don't want to introduce new markers for handling intermediate states.

I really prefer avoiding those kind of "fake" marker which will have
a short lifetime and should not be seen by code (other than the code
moving this intermediate state to the final state).

My strategy was to ensure that once build_dt_info() is called, all
markers are fully correct with all field (is_local and ref) correctly
set.

build_dt_info() is called by all parser at the end of the parsing
operation to return a struct dt_info which is the dtc internal
internal representation used by the rest of code.

Are you ok with this strategy?

If yes, patches order in this series will be changed.

The current order is
 - Patch 7: Add support for FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE dtb tag
 - Patch 8: livetree: Improve get_node_by_phandle()
 - Patch 9: dtc: Complete REF_PHANDLE markers with ref strings and is_local flags

With that order we have the incomplete marker state present after patch 7 and
before patch 9.

Moving 'Add support for FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE dtb tag' after introducing the marker
state completion will avoid the problem.
 - Patch 7: livetree: Improve get_node_by_phandle()
 - Patch 8: dtc: Complete REF_PHANDLE markers with ref strings and is_local flags
 - Patch 9: Add support for FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE dtb tag

Patch 8 and 9 could be squashed if you prefer to have the completion added
in the 'Add support for FDT_PROPDATA_PHANDLE dtb tag' patch.

Performing marker completion in build_dt_info() avoid additional markers
and avoid also incomplete markers in the code path.

Before build_dt_info() call, the internal devicetree representation doesn't
exits for dtc. We are in the process of parsing and so we are building this
internal representation. After this call, the internal representation exists
and all markers are fully set without the need to introduce (and handle)
additional markers.

In other word, dti returned by all dt_from_*() functions returns a fully
complete dt_info.
--- 8< ---
	if (streq(inform, "dts"))
		dti = dt_from_source(arg);
	else if (streq(inform, "fs"))
		dti = dt_from_fs(arg);
	else if(streq(inform, "dtb"))
		dti = dt_from_blob(arg);
	else
		die("Unknown input format \"%s\"\n", inform);
--- 8< ---

User of this dti will never see an incomplete marker.

Patch re-ordering proposed above will fix this problem.

Fine, will do what you've suggested.

Ok, will keep fdt32_ld().

Will update in the next iteration of the structured tag series and so no
modification will be present here in this support for addon series.

What do you thing about:
--- 8< ---
	/**
	 * fdt_next_tag - get next tag in the device tree
	...
	* returns:
 	*	The tag type, either a known tag or an unknown structured tag
	*       if this unknown tag can be skipped (SAFE_SKIP bit set in this
	*       tag).
	*	In case of error, FDT_END is returned with @nextoffset set to
	*	a negative error code.
 	*/
--- 8< ---

I suppose here, that you're ok to re-introduce SAFE_SKIP bit in structured tags
format. Asked in [1] and you don't reply yet.
