I think that should be OK. It only adds 2-3 lines?

I think "features forced to zero when #VE is reduced" doesn't matter at all
here. KVM cannot predict TD's behavior and KVM cannot make decision just based
on one of the possibility of TD's behavior. i.e., KVM still needs to consider if
it can support the features when TD doesn't enable reduce_ve. So what really
matters is KVM doesn't/cannot support these features correctly.

So it's just one category: features not supported by KVM.
We don't need to talk #VE reduction at all.

My bad. I only search 'CID' in arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c where uses CNXT-ID instead
of CID.

After some search, I find that X86_FEATURE_CID (CPUID.0x1:ECX[10]) is related to
MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE[24], which seems to be a model specific bit.

And on SDM, vol3. 14.5.6 L1 Data Cache Context Mode

  L1 data cache context mode is a feature of processors based on the Intel
  NetBurst microarchitecture that support Intel Hyper-Threading Technology.
  When CPUID.01H:ECX[10] =1, the processor supports setting L1 data cache
  context mode using the L1 data cache context mode flag (IA32_MISC_ENABLE[bit
  24]). Selectable modes are adaptive mode (default) and shared mode.

CPUID.0x1:ECX[10] is 0 on SPR and EMR (I didn't check more). It looks this CPUID
bit will not show up on any TDX capable CPUs. I think we can report it to TDX
architects and just make the bit fixed0 as a spec fix?

For X86_FEATURE_PBE (CPUID.0x1:EDX[31]), it's related to bit 10 of MSR
IA32_MISC_ENABLE. The CPUID is 1 on SPR and EMR. But bit 10 of MSR
IA32_MISC_ENABLE is always 0 and setting bit 10 to 1 fails. It seems though
CPUID.0x1:EDX[31] is set to 1, but it's not related to bit 10 of MSR
IA32_MISC_ENABLE?

why guest OS matters? Are you considering the compatibility that it will break
the case where host userspace configures them to TDs and the TD OS (other than
Linux) is using them? If from this perspective, other bits will be a concern as
well.

I see, it might be defined for TDX 2.0/3.0.

I think all the bits that are directly configurable but out of kvm_cpu_caps[]
and not supported by KVM fall into the last category. You can just list all of
them instead of my "for example".

As for the bits like FRED/RAO_INT, we don't need to consider them since they are
not generally supported by KVM.  They are just the new features to KVM, which
can be just treated as unknown though the TDX spec has defined the
virtualization type of them.
