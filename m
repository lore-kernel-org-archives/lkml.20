Subject: [PATCH v4 07/18] perf trace: Filter events in BPF and avoid
 tracepoint vetoes
From: Ian Rogers <irogers@google.com>
To: irogers@google.com, acme@kernel.org, namhyung@kernel.org, 
	Howard Chu <howardchu95@gmail.com>
Cc: adrian.hunter@intel.com, james.clark@linaro.org, jolsa@kernel.org,

	mingo@redhat.com, peterz@infradead.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

The BPF augmented_raw_syscalls sys_enter and sys_exit programs returned
0 for syscalls that were not of interest. Returning 0 from a tracepoint
BPF program vetoes the event for the whole system, so an unrelated
concurrent perf trace, perf record or ftrace session listening to
raw_syscalls would silently lose events. This is a cross-session side
effect and shows up as flaky failures when perf tests run in parallel.

Furthermore, syscall_unaugmented previously returned 1 without writing
anything to the __augmented_syscalls__ ring buffer. This forced
userspace perf trace to listen to both raw_syscalls:sys_enter and
__augmented_syscalls__ in its evlist, requiring userspace event
deduplication.

Address these issues:
1. In augmented_raw_syscalls.bpf.c, never return 0 from tracepoint
   handlers: return 1 so non-traced syscalls pass through without
   vetoing other concurrent listeners.
2. Introduce pids_to_trace and syscalls_to_trace BPF hash maps to
   perform targeted filtering directly in BPF. Unselected syscalls or
   PIDs return 1 immediately without writing to the buffer.
3. In syscall_unaugmented, output the unaugmented enter payload into
   __augmented_syscalls__ and return 1. Change its section from
   SEC("tp/raw_syscalls/sys_enter") to
   SEC("tp/syscalls/sys_enter_unaugmented") so libbpf does not attempt
   to auto-attach it to raw_syscalls:sys_enter.
4. In bpf_trace_augment.c, add helpers to configure target PIDs and
   syscalls in the BPF maps, setting the activation flags
   (has_pids_to_trace, has_syscalls_to_trace) only after the maps are
   fully populated so already-attached BPF programs do not filter against
   a half-filled map. Explicitly attach only sys_enter and sys_exit via
   an attach_prog() helper that saves -errno before calling pr_debug()
   or bpf_link__destroy().

   Destroy the skeleton on every failure path. Leaving a loaded but
   unusable skeleton behind is not inert: the setters called later from
   trace__run() would program its maps, and a partial attach would leave
   a BPF program live on raw_syscalls for a session that never starts.
   Since augmented_syscalls__{prepare,create_bpf_output}() failures fall
   back to unaugmented tracing rather than aborting, those setters have
   to become no-ops, which they only do once skel is NULL again.

   errno is used directly here, so include <errno.h> rather than relying
   on it arriving via another header, which it does not under musl.
5. In builtin-trace.c, hook trace__set_ev_qualifier_filter() and PID
   filtering into the BPF maps. When __augmented_syscalls__ is active,
   remove raw_syscalls:sys_enter from trace.evlist since all traced enter
   events (both augmented and unaugmented) are now emitted by BPF into
   __augmented_syscalls__. Identify that evsel by comparing against
   trace.syscalls.events.sys_enter rather than by a strstr() of its
   name. The substring "syscalls:sys_enter" also matches the per
   syscall syscalls:sys_enter_SYSCALL tracepoints, which a user can ask
   for by name, and now that the match decides what is taken out of the
   evlist, claiming one of those would drop an event that was asked for
   and would describe __augmented_syscalls__ with its format rather
   than the raw one's. Restore tracking on the remaining evsel via
   evlist__set_tracking_event() so PERF_RECORD_COMM and tracking events
   continue to be recorded. Errors from
   augmented_syscalls__set_target_syscalls() are reported and
   propagated, the tracepoint filter string is freed on every exit path,
   and an allocation failure in trace__set_filter_pids() now returns
   -ENOMEM instead of being silently ignored.

   Note that in trace__set_filter_pids() the target pids and the filtered
   pids are two independent axes and both have to be programmed. Naming
   pids to leave out with --filter-pids does not widen -p/-t or a workload
   to the whole system, and a BPF tracepoint program is attached system
   wide rather than to the target's file descriptors, so pids_to_trace is
   the only thing keeping other tasks out.
6. Add --syscall-augment option (defaulting to true) to allow users to
   explicitly use --no-syscall-augment to run perf trace in the classic
   unaugmented tracepoint mode without BPF. When BPF is unavailable or
   disabled, ensure the non-augmented tracepoint path cleanly configures
   sys_enter and sys_exit without duplicate entries.

   In trace__run(), add those tracepoints only when neither of them is
   in the evlist already. trace__add_syscall_newtp() adds the pair
   whatever is there, and cmd_trace() may have left either or both
   behind: both when it prepared augmentation and then gave up on it,
   the exit one alone when __augmented_syscalls__ took over the enters.
   Neither is covered by trace.raw_augmented_syscalls, which is only
   set when the exit evsel is named raw_syscalls:sys_exit, and not on a
   kernel old enough for perf_evsel__raw_syscall_newtp() to have fallen
   back to syscalls:sys_exit. Adding the pair again reports the events
   that were there twice, which the fallback after a bpf-output failure
   already did before this.

   Act on trace__add_syscall_newtp()'s result in cmd_trace() rather
   than discarding it. Those tracepoints are what the augmented events
   are described and paired with, so without them there is nothing to
   augment: the skeleton is dropped and the session carries on with
   plain tracepoints, which is what the bpf-output failure beside it
   already does, and what lets the evlist test above rely on the exit
   tracepoint being there whenever the bpf-output event is.

A target that does not fit in the map is not a reason to give up on the
session. bpf_map__update_elem() answers -E2BIG once max_entries keys are
present, so a target with more threads than pids_to_trace has room for
would take the whole of perf trace down with it, on exactly the large
workloads where there is least else to reach for. The tasks that fit are
added, a warning says how many did not, and the ones left out are in the
position they would have been in had they been created once the map was
already full, which sched_process_fork() has to allow for regardless.

Report a failure to program the pid filters with the error that caused
it. trace__run() sent everything trace__set_filter_pids() returned to
out_error_mem, which prints "Not enough memory to run!". That was
already a guess, and becomes a wrong one now that the function also
writes BPF maps, which fail for reasons of their own that have nothing
to do with memory and that the message gives the user no way to act on.

Report a failure to program the syscall filters the same way. The
pr_err() in trace__set_ev_qualifier_filter() ran before trace__run()
reached out_errno and printed "%m", and anything called in between
could have changed errno by then, so the two did not have to agree.
The inner report becomes a pr_debug() and the caller prints the error
it was given, which leaves out_errno without a user and it is removed.
