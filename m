Sure. So perhaps "enabled" should come first in the introduction? And
then the (non-orthogonal, per below) relationships can be described when
introducing the others?

I think you've hit on a key point here, which makes it hard to
understand RPM sometimes. Indeed enabled-vs-active are not fully
orthogonal, but then, I also think your "generally speaking" qualifier
is holding a lot of weight here -- there are quite a few ways in which
active/suspended are relevant independently of enabled/disabled.

For one, an active disabled device *will* prevent its parent from
suspending, while a suspended disabled device will not. (Now, is that an
*important* state? An expected state? Maybe not really, but it at least
clouds a reader's mental model.)

And then, reading these 3 helpers, I constantly have to refer back to
their implementation:

	pm_runtime_active()
	pm_runtime_suspended()
	pm_runtime_status_suspended()

The existence of pm_runtime_status_suspended() (which ignores
disable_depth) means I can never fully apply the reasoning you suggest.
I need to consider both the disable_depth and the runtime_status when
understanding how a device will behave.

Perhaps "independent" is a better term? I agree they're not fully
unrelated, but they're also not fully dependent -- active/suspended has
significant meaning even when disabled.

In any case, I'll try to incorporate some more color about how they do
relate.

Ack. I had this in mind at some point during the drafting, but when RPM
is so complicated, it's hard to choose where and when to document all
the exceptions.

Is that really true? A disabled-but-active device still prevents its
parents and suppliers from suspending, as far as I can tell.

If I can interpret *your* intended mental model: if we intend not to
RPM-manage a device, it should be left disabled and suspended, in which
case it will generally be ignored by RPM. (Or alternatively:
disabled-but-active is not generally an expected long-term "steady"
state.)

But if that's all true, I'm still not sure what to document, to balance
focus and simplicity (for an introduction) vs covering all the edge
cases and complexities. Perhaps for an intro: we start with
"enabled/disabled", and suggest that if a driver never touches RPM (and
never "enables" the device), RPM mostly stays out of the way.
But if we want to opt into RPM, then we enable() (and then start to
think about active/suspended, per the 2nd key state).

[ Side note: since you mentioned PCI... that gets into a real-world case
  of confusion: I've dealt with PCI driver authors that want to "prevent
  runtime PM" in their driver [*], since they hadn't finished validating
  all the runtime_suspend/resume behavior for a particular device. In
  that case, pm_runtime_disable() was actually an OK choice, because the
  PCI device was already active. But if they applied your quoted
  reasoning, they'd have to choose something else. (And frankly, they
  probably should.) But would that be forbid()? Or get()? That's exactly
  the sort of question I'd hope this document can help clarify.

  [*] ...yes, the PCI bus purposely holds a usage count, requiring
  drivers to opt into RPM by pm_runtime_put_noidle() or similar... But
  the question arises nonetheless, when people aren't really RPM
  experts, and they're dealing with vendor drivers with odd code
  structure. ]

Logically: mostly not. But patch 10 ("PM: runtime: Add "Section"
hyperlinks") touches some of the same areas and so does not apply
without conflicts.

I can try to rebase/rework/resend the patches you didn't apply, and I'll
again try to keep the likely-more-controversial parts toward the end.
(So, probably push this one a little further back.)

Regards,
Brian
