I would like to avoid bootloaders being blocking points and so:
 a) They should not failed if they encounter an unknown skippable tag.
    We are in sync on this point.

 b) They should preserve tags as much as possible.
    The goal is to allow following software components (probably the Kernel)
    to handle new tags.
    This is the point where the right balance has be found.

Your first proposal is maybe too much aggressive on b). That's why, even it
is more complex to implement I would prefer your last proposal (taking into
account the property offset issue) which can be summarize with the following
table:

                      | existing prop | existing node (1)   | Downgrade
                      | unknown tag   | unknown tag         | version (2)
----------------------+---------------+---------------------+-----------
Modify a property (5) |    Remove     | Keep (3) 	    | Yes
Add a property        |    NA         | Remove              | Yes
Delete a property     |    Remove     | Remove              | Yes (4)
Add a sub-node        |    NA         | Remove              | Yes
Delete a sub-node     |    NA         | Remove              | Yes
----------------------+---------------+---------------------+-----------

(1) The existing node is the node were the property or sub-node involved
    are present. Not all nodes, not the parent node but the node directly
    impacted by the modification.

(2) We downgrade the version only if tag are removed. If no unknown tags are
    involved (and so not removed), the version will not be be downgraded.

(3) Removing unknown tags in the node when a property is modified will lead
    to the property offset change. Prefer avoid the property offset change
    and so keep node related unknown tags in that case.

(4) The version is downgrade only if we remove some tags related to the
    node. If we remove only tags related to the property we delete, there
    is no reason to downgrade the version.

(5) All property modifications done outside libfdt using directly the
    property data pointer will not lead to any unknown tag removal.
    
    This point is for the usage of fdt_get_property_by_offset_w(),
    fdt_get_property_namelen_w(), fdt_get_property_w(),
    fdt_getprop_by_offset_w(), fdt_getprop_namelen_w(), fdt_getprop_w() and
    maybe other similar functions where the property is returned writable
    for possible modification. 'modify a property' mentioned in the table
    is related to modification done using fdt_setprop_*() and fdt_appendprop_*()
    function families.

On your side, is all of that conservative enough to be used when modification
involved unknown tags?
