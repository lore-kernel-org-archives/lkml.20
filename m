Yes, exactly. The main use case is to configure tracing before the
target task starts, when there is no PID for pidof to return. Thanks,

Thank you for the suggestion!

My understanding is that, instead of adding comm-specific function
filters, we could add generic event-trigger actions that update the
existing function PID filter.

For example, the task_rename event already observes task comm changes.
Conceptually, a user could configure something like:

  ftrace_pid_add:pid if newcomm == "foo"
  ftrace_pid_del:pid if oldcomm == "foo" && newcomm != "foo"

The command names and syntax above are only examples. The PID field
would be selected from the event record, so the same actions could be
used with other events and filters, rather than being tied to comm or
task_rename.

I think the trigger actions could update the same PID list used by
set_ftrace_pid. A PID added by a trigger would then become a normal
set_ftrace_pid entry and would be visible when the file is read. The
list would be shared state, without tracking whether an entry came from
a user or a particular trigger. Removing a trigger would stop future
updates but would not roll back PIDs that it had already added.

Since an event trigger may run in a context where the PID list and
per-CPU cache cannot be updated directly, the trigger could queue the
operation to a worker. The worker would update the PID list and refresh
the cached task-filter result.

For the comm use case, a delete action on task_rename would remove a PID
when the task no longer has the selected comm. A delete action on
sched_process_exit could also remove stale PIDs when matching tasks
exit.

This would primarily support rules installed before a task starts or
before the relevant event occurs. It would not discover tasks that
already match when the trigger is installed unless they generate the
event again.

Does this shared PID-list and generic add/delete trigger model match
what you had in mind?
