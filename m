It's along my rough idea, too.  We can simply compare the common
parent USB device in the match function.

I'm afraid that the softdep is problematic because it'd bring this
always no matter which device is used.  In the case of USB-audio, the
state restoration is always racy per design of multiple USB interfaces
(the probe happens multiple times and the instances are added at each
probe).

I think it's rather a question to HID people...

Well, let's experiment the component stuff a bit.  The v8 doesn't look
too bad, and the disconnection notification handling can be added
easily there, too.  Although I think the component is cleaner from the
design POV, the actual behavior might be problematic in practice (such
as the mixer state restore delay as you described) -- or the
implementation might become too complex than wished.  Let's see.
