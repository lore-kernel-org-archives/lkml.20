Yes, I stumbled upon this problem while trying to do exactly what is on
the commit messages, so having a system that does A/B updates and uses
the watchdog to detect if the boot succeeded or failed. The current boot
delay is actually (1000000 / 32768) * 10 = 305us, so quite a bit smaller
than the 30ms you mention, even though from the Sashiko comments I need
to take into account the prescaler, which in the worst case brings the
value to the 30ms you mention, but if I adjust it I can bring it down to
3ms in the worst case of a 128 prescaler. However, for a system with
prescaler=1 the delay can be brought down to 30us.

Here with ti,no-reset-on-init the ti-sysc driver will shutdown the
watchdog driver after 30 seconds, which can indeed cause problems. When
I sent the patch I thought the timeout would be 3 seconds, which
considerable reduces the possibility of a bootloop. I will look into it
to see if it makes sense to change the timeout value and reduce the
possibility of the bootloop. My initial assumption of the 3 seconds was
what actually made me not add ti,no-idle-on-reset since that would
completely block the watchdog stopping from ti-sysc.

The reason is that in these systems the watchdog is not behaving as one
would expect: if the bootloader leaves the watchdog running it is a
reasonable expectation that unless the kernel or userspace services it
the system should shutdown. With this series I have tried to achieve
this while minimizing the risk of regressions, and from my point of
view the only sore point is indeed the 30s timeout in ti-sysc. If you
agree with my reasoning and think this is worth pursuing let me know and
I will change the 30s timeout for v2. In the meantime patch 1 is
completely regression free and can be picked up!

Thanks,
Diogo
