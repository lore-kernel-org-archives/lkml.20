A single device may run multiple independent algorithms in parallel
-- e.g. the HiSilicon ZIP device has separate compression and
decompression engines whose usage rates are independent and cannot
be aggregated into one meaningful number.

Following your suggestion of different sysfs files, one approach is
to expose one file per algorithm.  Each file contains a single int
(0-100) formatted with sysfs_emit(), and the callback returns int.
But the number of algorithms is driver-specific (1 to 3 in the
HiSilicon drivers), so the framework would need to create attributes
dynamically at registration time, which adds complexity.

I'm not sure this is the best approach.  Do you have a better
suggestion for handling this case?

Thanks!
