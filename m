Am I reading this correctly as a proposed VFS invariant: ->flush() must
not return an interruption result which could become visible as EINTR
to a surviving userspace caller of close()? A fatal signal is the
exception because the task will die before observing the return value.

That seems like a reasonable invariant, but I couldn't find it
documented anywhere. Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst currently says
only:

    flush
        called by the close(2) system call to flush a file

without specifying allowed return values or signal semantics.

I had originally approached this from the userspace contract. close(2)
guarantees relinquishing the descriptor, but does not provide a general
synchronization guarantee. In particular, successful close() does not
mean regular-file data has reached storage. Applications which require
that guarantee need an explicit synchronization operation such as
fsync() or fdatasync() before close().

The close(2) documentation does say that later close-time operations,
including flushing data to a filesystem or device, *can* report errors.
But I don't read it as guaranteeing that all such work completes or that
all outstanding errors are discovered before close() returns.

That's why I was thinking EINTR should simply be converted to success
by close() implementation.

So I think the important distinction is:

1. userspace is not generally promised completion of arbitrary
   close-time work; but

2. if a subsystem deliberately performs synchronous work in ->flush(),
   the kernel may nevertheless require that work to complete for the
   subsystem's own semantics.

If (2) is the intended VFS rule, then I agree that converting EINTR to
success in close() would hide a bug rather than fix it. The bug would
be an ->flush() implementation allowing an ordinary signal to abandon
work which it intended to perform synchronously.

Would it make sense to document that invariant explicitly, e.g. that
->flush() must not return -EINTR or -ERESTART* due to an ordinary
non-fatal signal?

If those results should be considered implementation bugs, perhaps a
useful diagnostic would also be something along these lines:

---
retval = filp_flush(file, current->files);

WARN_ONCE(retval == -EINTR ||
          retval == -ERESTARTSYS ||
          retval == -ERESTARTNOINTR ||
          retval == -ERESTARTNOHAND ||
          retval == -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK,
          "close: ->flush %ps returned interrupt error %d\n",
          file->f_op->flush, retval);
---

That would leave the existing userspace ABI unchanged while making
remaining offending implementations easier to find and fix.

I also considered retrying filp_flush() inside close(), but I don't
think that can be done generically. ->flush() is not documented as
safe to restart from the beginning after partial execution, and
an interruptible wait could immediately encounter the same
still-pending signal again. So fixing the interruptibility at the
offending wait seems safer if the above invariant is indeed
the intended one.
