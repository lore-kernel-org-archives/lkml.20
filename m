Fixing an issue sashiko finds does not mandate you to send the fixed=20
version out right away. And yes, definitely, fix those issues as soon as=20
you want, no matter what's the source (sashiko, human reviewer, your own=20
mind finding flaws when given time to process the code you've=20
read/written), they'll then be in store for the time when it's time to=20
send the next version.

We do know this is a major problem with AI review that it pushes=20
submitters to do rapid refresh cycle on the false pretence that reviewers=
=20
must always see the latest and shiniest code (despite often the corner=20
cases sashiko find relate to a single obscure driver most reviewers would=
=20
have no opinion anyway) or that humans should only be bothered when AI bot=
=20
found nothing (yet they always have a huge cc lists and mailing lists with=
=20
hundreths if not thousands receipients so it doesn't add up with that=20
excuse either!). Effectively such a patch sending loop ends up only=20
feeding the AI review bot.

It's quite irrelevant to me whether I can see the reviews Sashiko gives=20
(and I could look them up from https://sashiko.dev if I'd be interested=20
and they do appear there).

When I do review the patch series I'm not basing my review on top of=20
sashiko's nor on top of other reviewer's. Sometimes I end up reviewing=20
something that gets updated by a later version because of that but it also=
=20
makes me immune to false claims or fixations of others. But the number one=
=20
cause for me reviewing an older version is sender sending versions very=20
close to each other, often during weekend (in how many cases the part of=20
the code I commented on had changed, I don't have an estimate for you,=20
sorry).

At reaching v6 this fast, you've clearly done something wrong given=20
multiple people are pointing out this to you, and yet all we get in=20
response is that "I only did it because sashiko gave me things to fix".=20
What is missing is a clear indication that you've understood the way=20
you've behaved so far will not maintain good appearance in the eyes of=20
many of the community. So please consider if it is really worth the few=20
extra days waiting would require.

I suggest you never do more than two versions per week on any non-trivial=
=20
series. I can understand sometimes a quick refresh (especially when=20
at v1-v2) is warranted but to do it for many versions close to each other=
=20
is something that people don't want to see.


And I do know how annoying it is to wait with patches and submit=20
prerequisite fixes first, with all the annoying delay it comes with
for the main patches one wants to get upstreamed, so I'm in no different
boat than you when it comes to that part.
