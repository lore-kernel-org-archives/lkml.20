Not unlikely, so likely that is :)

I wanted it to work as regular O_CREAT, so no forced O_EXCL per se.

Can ->atomic_open() return a negative dentry?

Yes, I follow this. But we do need to ask their maintainers then why that
was chosen. Plus, we need to ban negative dentry returns also for future
fses, which may be limiting.

Yeah, I don't quite understand the specifics of this as I am not familiar
with NFS and the likes. I presume because of things like network traffic
->atomic_open() was needed as a single call into the underlying fs. But
I have no idea why or why not that would make sense for directories. If
we do it the way you suggest now, we can get rid of all the O_CREAT stripping
