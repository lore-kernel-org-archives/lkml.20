Excellent summary.

Alexei, for those of us contemplating potentially large BPF-LSM
projects, does this imply that eBPF may never be ready for other than
small boutique based security implementations?

Interested in your thoughts.

Based on Micka's mail that we responded to, this seems contrary to the
intent of what you are trying to implement.

We can see where you are not making BPF depend on LandLock internals.

However, from his description, the intent is to have a process compose
a LandLock policy and then hand enforcement off to an eBPF program,
which on the surface would seem to suggest that the intent is to allow
eBPF programs to enforce LandLock specific functionality and controls.

Perhaps we still misunderstand.

The same.
