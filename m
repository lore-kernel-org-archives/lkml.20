Subject: [PATCH v13 00/14] accel/rocket: RK3576 NPU (RKNN) enablement
Date: Tue, 15 Sep 2026 22:43:14 +1200

This adds the RK3576 NPU to accel/rocket, which today supports RK3588
only. The RK3576 carries two cores of the same RKNN block, wired up
differently. Two extra convolution buffer clocks, two power domains per
core, one reset where the RK3588 has two, no NPU SRAM rail, and a
PC_TASK_CON that packs the task number into sixteen bits, not twelve.

1/14 is Igor Paunovic's "[PATCH v2] accel/rocket: request the core clocks
by name", carried in the series since v11 so it applies to a plain
next-20260914 with nothing outside it to follow. It keeps his authorship
and its four tags, which name RK3588 boards. Everything else here was
tested on a Radxa ROCK 4D.

Two things changed since v12: a correction to what 3/14 CLAIMS, and a fix to
what 3/14 DOES. The first is why this respin exists; the second is a review
finding on the version I was about to send.

Igor Paunovic re-ran his induced-reset protocol on v12 as posted and
found an error in his own reports, which v12's 3/14 carried. His script
kept the scorer output of every inference per round and never aggregated
it, and his summaries scored only the one inference after the forced
autosuspend. Aggregated, the constant-0x80 result is in the rounds of
nearly every run, on every arm, on all three dates.

So the all-0x80 buffer is not a differential signal: it is what a job
cancelled by the reset looks like from userspace, whatever made it miss its
deadline. 3/14 says why, from the code, and his kprobe on
drm_sched_fence_finished() is the direct witness.

  3/14   loses the claim that 19 August showed no manifestation on either
         arm with the oracle 48/48 throughout, and "one event in 53
         differential resets against zero in 49" as a bound. His own
         summary replaces them, quoted as he wrote it, with the caveat
         that the protocol bounds and does not prove as the last sentence
         of the quote so that "it" has its referent. His 2026-09-12
         message is a third Link.

  3/14   drops "differential base" from its Tested-by comment, and 2/14
         gains "induced reset, JOB_TIMEOUT_MS=2". 4/14 already read
         that. All three now say the same thing, which is what he
         tested: one protocol, three patches, no differential.

  4/14   loses "45 induced resets across three cores". He corrected that
         in the same mail: all 45 landed on core 0, the other two being
         bound but idle in his single client protocol. Nothing else in
         that patch changes.

Thirteen of the fourteen diffs are byte for byte what v12 posted. 3/14's is
not: it is the one code change, four lines of lock scope, described below.
Two further commit messages moved and neither changes a line of code.
9/14 gained the answer below to Sashiko's [High], and corrected its own
sentence about the twelve rk3576 boards that declare no domain-supply: they
never reach a first power-on, so the dummy regulator and the dev_warn it
described do not happen there. 13/14 corrected one number of its own,
derived from its own table, and dropped a claim about boot-to-boot drift
that one boot's own spread cannot support.

This is worth a respin, not a note in the thread: a commit message is the
permanent record, and v12's states something its own witness has
retracted.

And the code change, which is 3/14's own doing. That patch adds two PC
register writes to rocket_reset() -- masking INTERRUPT_MASK and clearing the
raw status before synchronize_irq() -- and in v12 they sat outside job_lock.
rocket_job_hw_submit() arms the same register and always runs under that
lock; reset.pending is set in rocket_job_timedout() without it and read in
hw_submit() with it, and both are plain atomics. So a submit that has
already passed its reset.pending check can re-arm the mask after the reset
clears it, leaving the block running a task with its interrupt live while
synchronize_irq() fences a handler that has already finished. The next
completion then stops a task that has only just started, which is the
failure 2/14 exists to prevent -- on the other register. In v13 the mask and
the clear are inside a scoped_guard(mutex, &core->job_lock); the
synchronize_irq() stays outside it, where it has to be.

It needs a multi-task job, so hw_submit() is running from the IRQ thread
rather than the scheduler thread and drm_sched_stop() does not fence it.

THIS CHANGE POSTDATES IGOR PAUNOVIC'S Tested-by ON 3/14. His runs were
against the v12 form, outside the lock. The tag is kept because the path and
the protocol are the same and the change only narrows when the two writes
may happen, but say if you would rather it were dropped until he has run the
new one.

Sashiko reviewed v12 on 12 September, ten mails. No code in v13 answers any
of it. Three findings are new; the fourth below, on 8/14, is not, and is here
because it lands on a binding this cover calls Acked and unchanged. The
answers to all four are arguments rather than changes. The one code change
in this version came from a different review, and is the next section:

  4/14  [High] the runtime PM put is asynchronous, and drm_sched_start()
        at the end of rocket_reset() lets the next job's
        pm_runtime_resume_and_get() cancel the pending autosuspend.
        pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() is suggested. This is the v11
        finding below with a second mechanism attached.
  9/14  [High] forcing the NPU parent domain off at probe bypasses the
        idle sequence for its child domains, risking AXI bus hangs, and
        can make pm_genpd_add_subdomain() fail. 9/14 had not been
        reviewed before this.
  9/14  [Medium] need_regulator is being hijacked to force that
        power-off, which warns on the boards that declare no
        domain-supply.

  8/14  [High] rockchip,rk3568-iommu is called an unsafe fallback for
        rockchip,rk3576-npu-iommu, because a driver older than the July
        2026 devm_clk_bulk_get_all change binds the fallback and enables
        two of the five clocks. That is against a binding this cover
        calls unchanged since v9 and Acked, so it belongs here and not
        only in the thread.

All four have an answer below. Three of them are reasons the finding does
not stand, one of those being a reason not to make the change suggested.
The fourth, on 4/14, is incomplete coverage rather than a regression, and
the change that would close it is offered there for you to choose.

9/14's is in the patch. RK3588_PD_NPU has carried need_regulator since it
was added, with req_mask 0 exactly as RK3576_PD_NPU has, so
rockchip_pd_power(pd, false) has been running at probe on every rk3588
board and rockchip_pmu_set_idle_request() has been returning immediately
because there is no request to make. Of the forty-nine in-tree rk3588 board
files, twenty-one enable an NPU core and declare the supply, two enable one
with no supply and take the dummy and the warn today (quartzpro64 and
youyeetoo-yy3588), and twenty-six enable no core at all, so ->power_on never
runs there and nothing warns. If the -EINVAL half held,
rockchip_pm_domain_probe() would fail on all forty-nine. The idle handshake
lives in the child domains and both SoCs keep it.

4/14's outcome is right and the mechanism is not. rpm_resume() does not
cancel a running autosuspend timer: there is a comment in runtime.c saying
so, and it only deactivates the timer when timer_autosuspends is clear.
What defeats the suspend is the usage count, which is 1 once the next job
has resumed the device, so when the 50 ms timer fires
rpm_check_suspend_allowed() returns -EAGAIN. The end result is the one
Sashiko describes: no power-off, so 10/14's reset pulse and 9/14's delay do
not run.

The scope is narrower than the finding suggests. drm_sched_start()
completes the detached jobs with -ECANCELED rather than re-running them, so
with an empty entity queue nothing takes a new reference and the timer
fires cleanly, which is what the measurement above shows. The gap opens
only when a client has a second job queued or resubmits inside 50 ms. That
is incomplete coverage, not a regression: the patch is still
strictly better than the pm_runtime_put_noidle() it replaces, which
requested nothing at all. pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() would close it, but
it would run a genpd power-off and a regulator disable under job_lock;
latching in_flight_job inside the guard and doing the synchronous put after
it would be cleaner. Say which you would rather have and it goes in the
next version.

8/14's [High] does not stand, and acting on it would take the series with
it. rk_iommu_dt_ids[] has two entries, rockchip,iommu and
rockchip,rk3568-iommu, and rockchip,rk3576-iommu and rockchip,rk3588-iommu
already bind only through that fallback: dropping it leaves the NPU with no
IOMMU and 12/14 to 14/14 dead. The premise is right, in that before
841363ebb508 the driver took only aclk and iface by name. The conclusion is
not. Every MMIO site in rockchip-iommu.c sits behind
pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() except rk_iommu_suspend() and rk_iommu_resume(),
which are the runtime PM callbacks themselves and run only on a resume. On
such a kernel the device never resumes,
because the only thing that could wake it is the device link from its master
and the master compatible rockchip,rk3576-rknn-core is added by 12/14 of this
series. 841363ebb508's own message says writes to DTE_ADDR are silently
dropped until the extra clocks run, and reads work: not the hang described.
121 in-tree bindings have this shape, a fallback plus a compatible-gated
clock count, arm,mali-bifrost being the closest.

9/14's [Medium] does not stand either. need_regulator exists only in
pm-domains.c and has two documented meanings there, both pre-existing, and
the dev_warn it names is a one-line warning from the regulator core in
->power_on, not at the probe-time power-off.

Still open from v11, and the measurement below is the half of it that could
be measured. pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() is asynchronous with a 50 ms
delay, so on a workload whose submit gap is shorter the domain does not
cycle after a reset, 10/14's power-on pulse never fires, and
rocket_core_reset()'s own resets are all that run. Measured on the domain
rather than on the device, over one 60.8 s decode of Phi-3.5-mini on a ROCK
4D, genpd's npu domain took 46.8 s active and 14.2 s idle, accounting for
the wall clock to within 0.2 s, and its idle-state usage count rose by 202.
The domain cycles about two hundred times a minute under a real decode, and
the pulse fires. Whether it cycles after a timed-out job depends on the gap
to the next submit, and inducing one needs a kernel with JOB_TIMEOUT_MS
lowered and a flash, so that half is still an argument.

5/14 moves the iommu_detach_group(NULL, iommu_group_get(core->dev)) line
out of the IRQ handler and into rocket_job_next_locked().
ZhaoJinming's "accel/rocket: Fix iommu_group leak and unsafe IRQ
register access" changes the same line and is marked for stable. It
carries Fixes: 0810d5ad88a1, which is the tag on our 2/14 and 4/14; our
5/14 carries no Fixes tag at all. Whichever lands first the other
conflicts; say which you would rather take.

Findings Sashiko labelled pre-existing, for Tomeu. These five recur across
both rounds, and num_cores was raised to Critical on 12/14 in the v12 one.
One not in the list is worth naming on its own: a 64-bit DMA address
truncated to 32 bits, which faults the IOMMU above 4 GB.

  - the job completion path takes iommu_group_get(core->dev) and never
    puts it, one group reference a job, flagged on seven of the nine
    mails the v11 round drew.
    5/14 moves this call without adding or removing it, so the leak
    is pre-existing but not untouched;
  - the shared IRQ handler touches registers without checking the PM
    state;
  - runtime suspend has no synchronize_irq();
  - num_cores is used both as an array length and as the probe index;
  - rdev is leaked through devres on probe deferral.

One more, not from Sashiko and not touched by this series, found while
checking 3/14's reasoning. rocket_core_fini() puts core->iommu_group and
NULLs it BEFORE rocket_job_fini(), which is what cancels the timeout worker
through drm_sched_fini(). A timeout in that window reaches
rocket_reset()'s iommu_detach_group(NULL, core->iommu_group) on the stored
pointer: a NULL dereference, or a use after free if it read the pointer
just before the store. It needs an unbind or a module unload with a job in
flight. Moving the cancellation ahead of the put fixes it, and 3/14 adds a
synchronize_irq() into that same window.

Still open from v9, no reply since. 9/14 does three things: it adds the
settle delay, renames a macro, and gives RK3576_PD_NPU a regulator,
which also makes every RK3576 board force that domain off at probe. I
asked whether it wants splitting; Abel Vesa's Reviewed-by may be the
answer, and I would rather split it than have it merged on my silence.
13/14 also gives each core both NPU domains, which is the description
that has been tested here rather than the topology; if it should be one
domain per core, 6/14's minItems has to change with it.

The bindings are unchanged since v9 and both checks were re-run for v13
rather than quoted from then. dt-doc-validate and yamllint are clean on
all three, with dtschema 2026.6 and yamllint 1.38.0. CHECK_DTBS was run
from scratch over every rk3576 and rk3588 device tree the Makefile lists, 15
and 59, and the only complaint is on rk3588-rock-5b-pcie-ep: a
vpcie3v3-supply that rockchip,rk3588-pcie-ep does not allow. That one is
present at the base commit with none of this series applied, and nothing
here touches an rk3588 dts. 13/14 adds a property to a dts and not to a
binding, and rock-4d is among those targets.

Applying order, because this series lands in three trees and 14/14 is not
safe on its own. 09 and 10 go through pmdomain, 01 to 05 and 11 and 12
through accel, 13 and 14 through rockchip, and 06, 07 and 08 are bindings
that can go with whichever tree takes the code they describe. 14/14 sets status = "okay" on
both cores and both MMUs, so a kernel that has the DTS half and the driver
half but not the pmdomain half powers the domain on with neither 10/14's
reset pulse nor 09/14's settle delay and reads PC_VERSION into the async
SError that 07 and 09 describe. That is an unbootable rock-4d, not a
degraded feature. 14/14 depends on 09, 10, 12 and 13; the other
intermediates are safe, since 13/14 alone leaves every node disabled, 11
and 12 alone add no DT nodes, and 10 alone is inert because no in-tree
power-domain node carries resets until 13/14. 09 alone is the one that does
something: giving RK3576_PD_NPU need_regulator makes
rockchip_pm_add_one_domain() power that domain off at probe on all thirteen
in-tree rk3576 boards, with or without the rest of the series. 09/14 argues
that is deliberate and why; it is not a state nothing reaches.
Holding 14/14 a cycle is fine by me if that is easier than coordinating.

An index of what this series needs decided, each argued where it is raised:

  4/14   the shape of the fix, if you want one
  5/14   ours or ZhaoJinming's; whichever lands first the other conflicts
  9/14   whether it splits, and the macro suffix scheme it asks about
  13/14  both NPU domains per core, as tested, or one
  --     the rocket_core_fini() ordering bug: here or on its own
  14/14  hold it a cycle, or coordinate the three trees
