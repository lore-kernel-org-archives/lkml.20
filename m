Subject: [PATCH v11 03/14] accel/rocket: wait for a running IRQ handler before resetting a core

rocket_reset() calls drm_sched_stop(), which stops the scheduler and
returns. It does not wait for a threaded handler that is already
running, so the comment that follows, "Remaining interrupts have been
handled", states an assumption rather than something the code arranges.

Call synchronize_irq(core->irq) after drm_sched_stop() and reword the
comment to say what holds afterwards.

It has to go before the scoped_guard(mutex, &core->job_lock) rather than
inside it. rocket_job_handle_irq() takes job_lock, so waiting for the
handler while holding that lock would be waiting for a handler that is
waiting for us. Nothing is held at that point, and both callers,
rocket_job_timedout() and rocket_reset_work(), run in process context,
so sleeping there is allowed.

This does not stop a handler that has already read in_flight_job from
finishing its work on the job the reset is about to drop. That window
needs the check and the register writes to be one step under the lock,
which is what the previous patch does; the two are complementary.

Mask the block before the sync as well. INTERRUPT_MASK is armed by
hw_submit() on every submit and cleared only by the hardirq, so on an
ordinary timeout it is still live and a completion can arrive after
synchronize_irq() returns. Nothing is lost by clearing it, since the next
submit arms it again.

That write is the first register access this function has ever made, and
it is guarded, because the function holds no runtime PM reference of its
own. The only reference in the window belongs to in_flight_job, and the
completion path can have put it and cleared the pointer before the
timeout worker arrives: drm_sched_stop() sits in between and can block on
cancel_work_sync() and on a dma_fence_wait(), and it subtracts every
pending job's credits, so rocket_job_is_idle() is true and
rocket_device_runtime_suspend() will not refuse. With the autosuspend
delay elapsed the clocks are off and both NPU domains are down. A
register access in that state takes an async SError on this hardware,
which is the failure two later patches in this series describe from the
power-on side.

pm_runtime_get_if_active() resumes nothing and allocates nothing; if the
core is already down there is no live interrupt to mask and the following
synchronize_irq() is all that is needed. Igor Paunovic asked the general
form of this on v8 -- whether rocket_reset() should hold a reference --
and it was deferred then because nothing in the path touched a register.
This patch is what makes it matter.

The deadlock this placement avoids would not have been reported. The wait
is on desc->wait_for_threads rather than on a lock, so lockdep does not
model it and it would have hung silently.
