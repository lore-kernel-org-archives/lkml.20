Now I understood the requirement much better. The core issue with OSI is
that it fails unless the platform downgrades special system states to
non-system states during routine CPUIdle paths.

This leaves us with two directions for OSI:
1. Firmware Resolution: Handle state transitions entirely in firmware.
2. OS Intervention: Enforce the handling via the OS.

Though I personally prefer (1), I don't have strong arguments against (2)
now that you made me understand the requirement. Sorry for taking time,
but mentally I was assuming (1) even for OSI until your above response.

Since PC mode relies on the firmware to manage these states natively, this
binding isn't required for it. Therefore, Could we restrict this specific
binding exclusively to OSI implementations ?
