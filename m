JOB_TIMEOUT_MS is 500 ms, and when it fires panfrost resets the GPU and
the job is lost. But a job that runs longer is not necessarily hung:
OpenCL kernels and heavy fragment jobs legitimately take seconds on a
small GPU. On a Mali-G31 (one shader core) that breaks, among others:

- OpenCL CTS Integer Ops quick_long_math and quick_ulong_math (long16
  64-bit division, > 500 ms per kernel): each subtest logs

    panfrost 1800000.gpu: gpu sched timeout, js=1, config=0x7300, status=0x8, head=0xa0161c0, tail=0xa0161c0

  (status 0x8 = ACTIVE) and fails with the work-items after the reset
  never written; Thread Dimensions quick_2d/3d lose whole rows the same
  way.
- KHR-GLES31.core.blend_equation_advanced.test_coherency.mixedSequence:
  a 44-draw fragment job on a 1024x1024 target needs about 0.7 s, and
  the tiles it had not reached at 500 ms read back as 0,0,0,0.
- dEQP-VK.spirv_assembly.type.vec4.*_frag cases (a loop over the whole
  dataset in every fragment): "Incomplete job or timeout".

The Arm driver time-slices instead: a job is soft-stopped after its
time slice and resumed later, it is hard-stopped only when it has not
stopped after 5 s (JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_SS = 50 ticks of 100 ms), and the
GPU is reset only when the hard stop has not taken effect 0.5 s after
that (JS_RESET_TICKS_SS = 55). Do the same from the timeout handler:

- a slot whose job is still ACTIVE when the timeout fires is
  soft-stopped and its job resumed from JS_TAIL, without a GPU reset and
  without raising its karma; a soft-stop takes effect at a task boundary
  only, after the tasks already issued have completed, so such a slot
  gets JOB_SOFT_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS (5 s) to go idle, idle or faulted slots
  keep the 10 ms;
- a slot still active after that is hard-stopped, which ends its job at
  once with TERMINATED (-ECANCELED); the stopped jobs on the other slots
  are resumed, nothing is reset. The job that did not stop is hung, so
  it gets its karma raised and a devcoredump, as a hung job did before;
- the GPU is reset when the hard stop has not taken effect after
  JOB_HARD_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS (0.5 s); the job that did not stop is then
  failed with -ECANCELED instead of being restarted from scratch, where
  it would only time out again. Jobs that were only given the 10 ms of a
  reset for another reason are restarted, as before;
- a reset that is asked for while the slots are being stopped (a job
  fault that needs one, the MMU) is not lost: the timeout only marks
  reset.pending for a stop (PANFROST_RESET_STOP_ONLY), a request for a
  reset overrides that, and the GPU is then reset;
- a job that completes between the timeout handler's fence check and its
  JS_STATUS read is not taken for a hung job: with its DONE interrupt
  pending or being handled, the timeout is spurious;
- without a reset, the address space references of the jobs cancelled
  from _NEXT are released (a reset has panfrost_mmu_reset() drop them),
  and a runtime PM reference is held across the stop and the
  resubmission, so that an autosuspend cannot power the GPU off between
  the two.

The timeout of a job that is merely long is now a dev_dbg(); faults,
jobs that do not stop and the other reset paths are reported as before,
with the status of every slot.

With this, on the Mali-G31 the Integer Ops, Thread Dimensions and
mixedSequence cases pass, and the two vec4 i8/u64 bit_field_insert
count64 fragment cases, which need several seconds to reach a task
boundary, pass in 4-6 s.
