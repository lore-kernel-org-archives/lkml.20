We'll still need to make sure that the PARTID used for the test hasn't got high occupancy in the
cache before running the benchmark.

I assume the occupancy is measured via resctrl, llc_occupancy.

Yes, I think so.

Would it end up like this?

1. Choose a test control group and ensure that it doesn't have high cache occupancy using llc_occupancy
(If it does have high cache occupancy then clean it. Probably by using separate buffer with a
separate control group)
2. Configure the L3 cache bitmap for the test control group
3. Run a benchmark
4. Check that the llc_occupancy is as expected
5. Repeat 1-4 with different cache bitmaps.

However, it doesn't sound specific to MPAM but more like a general test for the cache portion
bitmap. Possibly it can be a separate cross-architecture resctrl selftest that compliments the
(somewhat) intel specific cat_test. (There isn't a platform independent way of measuring slc cache
misses on arm64.) This depends of the resctrl selftest maintainers view.

Thanks,

Ben
