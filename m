Historically speaking, HID devices always have been under drivers/hid.
They are usually leaf drivers, only hooking to input/battery/LEDs.

As mentioned, hid-sensor-hub is an exception but this got sorted out by
splitting the HID part from the IIO.

Looking at the various MFD-like HID drivers, they all share the common
point of not really being HID devices: they rely on a custom protocol
handled in .raw_event().

So I think I'd be OK to have those drivers moved to the mfd tree as long
as they only rely on low level HID API, and do not have to deal with
"generic" HID report descriptors. If that arise, I think we should split
the HID/MFD parts like hid-sensor-hub does.

So you can have my unformal acked-by for transfering those drivers.

Last, I'm currently using a cp2112 as a i2c-hid bridge in my upstream
CI. It's relying on a DSDT override in the VM to actually work, and I'd
like to keep that around. So my main request here is to keep the
equivalent of the DSDT override in the MFD cells, at least for this one.

Cheers,
Benjamin
