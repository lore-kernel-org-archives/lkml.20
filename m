The current bool replace flag is too coarse: it is either all or
nothing. A livepatch with .replace=true replaces ALL existing
livepatches, which is safe but inflexible. There is no way to have
multiple independent livepatch sets coexist on the same system.

Replace it with a more flexible model using two new fields in
struct klp_patch:

- provides: an unsigned int id identifying the changes made by
  the related livepatch. Where the changes are a set
  of modified objects, functions, and used callbacks,
  shadow variable ids, and state ids.

- obsoletes: an optional array of unsigned int ids specifying
  additional provides ids to be replaced. This allows a new patch
  to explicitly obsolete patches from different scopes.

A new livepatch atomically replaces any existing livepatch that
meets either of the following conditions:

1. It has the same provides id as the new patch,
2. Its provides id is listed in the new patch's obsoletes list.

A new livepatch that does not replace an existing one can coexist
with it. In this case, the two livepatches must not modify the same
function, or use the state with the same id. Any attempt to load an
incompatible livepatch will be rejected by the kernel.

klp-build gains -p/--provides and -r/--obsoletes options.  The two
parameters are not validated in klp-build, since the compiler and the
kernel handle invalid values.

Enable the CONFIG_KLP_HAS_PROVIDES compile-time marker now that the
provides/obsoletes interface is implemented.

 Atomic Replace & Cumulative Patches
 ===================================
 
-There might be dependencies between livepatches. If multiple patches need
-to do different changes to the same function(s) then we need to define
-an order in which the patches will be installed. And function implementations
-from any newer livepatch must be done on top of the older ones.
-
-This might become a maintenance nightmare. Especially when more patches
-modified the same function in different ways.
-
-An elegant solution comes with the feature called "Atomic Replace". It allows
-creation of so called "Cumulative Patches". They include all wanted changes
-from all older livepatches and completely replace them in one transition.
-
-Usage
------
-
-The atomic replace can be enabled by setting "replace" flag in struct klp_patch,
-for example::
-
-	static struct klp_patch patch = {
-		.mod = THIS_MODULE,
-		.objs = objs,
-		.replace = true,
-	};
-
-All processes are then migrated to use the code only from the new patch.
-Once the transition is finished, all older patches are automatically
-disabled.
+Livepatches are used to fix kernel bugs. New fixes need to be added over time.
+The fixes might be independent, but they might also depend on each other. This
+brings a challenge of how to keep the livepatched system safe and consistent.
+
+Part of the solution is the "Atomic Replace" feature, which allows the kernel to
+atomically replace an existing livepatch with another one. These newer
+livepatches are designed as "Cumulative Patches". They include all wanted
+changes from all older livepatches and completely replace them in one
+transition.
+
+The second part of the solution are ``provides`` and ``obsoletes`` fields in
+``struct klp_patch``, which allow the installation of multiple livepatches in
+parallel. A livepatch will atomically replace any already installed livepatch
+whose ``provides`` id is the same as the new patch's ``provides`` id, or is
+listed in the new patch's ``obsoletes`` list. This might be used to fix
+independent problems separately, for example, the livepatches might be prepared
+by separate teams focusing on particular functionality or a subsystem.
+
+It should be emphasized that the preferred and most secure way is to always use
+the default ``provides = 0``. As long as all livepatches use the same default
+id, any livepatch replaces any other livepatch, preventing any unexpected
+interactions between incompatible livepatches.
+
+Installing more livepatches in parallel is dangerous, especially
+when they are provided by different teams or vendors. The built-in
+checks for possible conflicts do not prevent potential
+incompatibilities and breakages. For example, two livepatches might
+modify different functions but still affect each other via shared
+data structures or global variables.
+
+Provides and Obsoletes
+-----------------------
+
+The ``provides`` field in ``struct klp_patch`` is an unsigned integer that
+identifies the livepatch. By default, it is 0.
+
+The ``obsoletes`` field is an optional array of unsigned integers that
+specifies additional ``provides`` ids to be replaced when this patch is
+loaded.
+
+For example::
+
+        static struct klp_patch patch = {
+                .mod = THIS_MODULE,
+                .objs = objs,
+                .provides = 0,
+        };
+
+Any ``provides`` value might be associated with a set of livepatched symbols,
+callbacks, shadow variables, and state IDs. By definition, there can only ever
+be one active livepatch for a given ``provides`` id.
+
+On the contrary, a new livepatch that does not replace an existing one can
+coexist with it. In this case, the two livepatches must not modify the same
+function, or use the state with the same ID. Any attempt to load an incompatible
+livepatch will be rejected by the kernel.
+
+Atomic Replace
+--------------
+
+A livepatch with a given ``provides`` id is replaced by another livepatch
+with the same ``provides`` id, or whose ``obsoletes`` list includes that id.
+All processes are migrated to use the code only from the new patch. Once
+the transition is finished, the older patch is disabled. Patches with a
+different ``provides`` id are not affected and remain active.
 
 Ftrace handlers are transparently removed from functions that are no
 longer modified by the new cumulative patch.

+  - The rollback is even more complicated when the new livepatch
+    obsoletes more livepatches. For example, livepatch A (provides 1)
+    and livepatch B (provides 2) are independent. Livepatch C
+    (provides 3, obsoletes 1 and 2) replaces both A and B. A proper
+    rollback from C would require loading A and B synchronously.
+    It would need special support in the module loader and
+    the livepatch core code. This is not supported.
+
+    Instead, the rollback has to be done in more steps, for example::
+
+      echo 0 > /sys/kernel/livepatch/livepatch_C/enabled
+      modprobe livepatch_A
+      modprobe livepatch_B
+
+    Note that the replaced livepatches stay loaded but disabled.
+    They have to be removed before they can be loaded again.
+    The example above assumes that they were removed in
+    the meantime.
+
+    Also, the older livepatches can be loaded only when they do
+    not conflict with the still enabled ones, see the conflict
+    rules above. The newer livepatch is expected to include the
+    fixes from the obsoleted livepatches. As a result, the
+    rollback usually has to start by disabling the newer
+    livepatch. The rollback is not atomic. The affected
+    functions run the original code until all the older
+    livepatches get loaded again.
+
+
   - Only the (un)patching callbacks from the _new_ cumulative livepatch are
     executed. Any callbacks from the replaced patches are ignored.

+Installing more livepatches in parallel is dangerous, especially
+when they are provided by different teams or vendors. The built-in
+checks for possible conflicts do not prevent potential
+incompatibilities and breakages.
+
+Once the transition is complete, all functions (``struct klp_func``)
+associated with the matching replaced patches are removed from the
+corresponding ``struct klp_ops``. If a function is no longer modified by
+the new patch and its ``func_stack`` list becomes empty, the ftrace
+handler is unregistered and the ``struct klp_ops`` is freed.
 
 See Documentation/livepatch/cumulative-patches.rst for more details.
